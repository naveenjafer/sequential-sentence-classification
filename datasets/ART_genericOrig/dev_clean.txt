Problem	Bubble guidance of tubular growth in reaction–precipitation systems
Background	Numerous types of reaction–precipitation systems involve the growth of tubular structures similar to those formed in “silica gardens”.
Problem	As a model case for this phenomenon, we investigate the rapid growth of hollow tubes in the reaction between sodium silicate and cupric sulfate.
Method	The latter solution is injected hydrodynamically at constant flow rates of 1–20 mL h−1 into a large reservoir of waterglass.
Result	In this study, the growth is templated and guided by single, buoyant gas bubbles.
Result	The resulting tubes can be several decimetres long and have constant radii in the range of 100–600 μm.
Result	Systematic measurements show that bubble size governs the tube radius.
Result	According to this radius, the system selects its growth velocity following volume conservation of the injected solution.
Result	Moreover, scanning electron microscopy reveals intricate ring patterns on the tube walls.
Result	We also show evidence for the existence of a minimal and a maximal tube radius.
Result	Finally, we report an intriguing collapse of tubes created at high silicate concentrations, which yields twisted ribbon-like structures.
Problem	Critical radii and tube collapse are discussed in terms of simple competing forces.
Background	Self-organization in reaction–precipitation systems often leads to the formation of permanent tubular structures.
Background	Some of the most striking ones are 30 m high, black “smokers” growing at hydrothermal vents on the ocean’s floor.1
Background	As hot acidic, mineral-rich water from below the earth’s crust surges into the cool, alkaline ocean the dissolved minerals precipitate and aggregate in a ring-shape area at the jet’s boundary.
Background	Another geological example, soda-straw stalactites result from the periodic detachment of calcium carbonate-saturated water droplets in caves.2,3
Background	The pH increases during the drops’ hang-time and precipitation of CaCO3 occurs at the rim.
Background	This rhythmic deposition of material creates meter-long tubes of small but constant diameter.
Background	Similarly, capillary forces can create helictites, gravity defying structures, which grow along curved, spiral-like paths.4
Background	On a microscopic scale, hollow fibers form in setting Portland cement5,6 as well as in certain corrosion systems.7–9
Background	More recently, Goldstein et al. studied “ferrotubes” in an electrochemical system.
Background	In their experiment, small tubes are templated by successive detachment of gas bubbles formed at a steel cathode.10
Background	All of these phenomena share similarities with precipitation tubes in chemical (or silica) gardens which can be considered a prototypic case of gradient-induced tube formation in reaction–precipitation systems.
Background	Descriptions of the latter system are found as early as the 17th century.11,12
Background	Today, chemical gardens are known to many as a demonstration experiment that readily creates colorful, plant-like precipitation structures.
Background	Their formation is observed for many inorganic salts (e.g., CuSO4, MnCl2, FeCl3), crystals of which are placed into concentrated solutions containing anions such as silicate, phosphate or borate.
Background	Moreover, recent investigations of the properties of the material synthesized have contributed to a renewed scientific interest in chemical gardens.
Background	For example, Collins et al. reported evidence of surprisingly strong catalytic activity and discovered hierarchical nano- to micrometre structures in overall amorphous aluminosilicate precipitates.13,14
Result	Fig. 1 shows a typical landscape generated from cupric nitrate crystals seeded into 1 M silicate solution (waterglass).
Background	The surface of the seeds dissolves and reacts to form an insoluble metal hydroxide membrane.
Background	As the concentration of metal ion increases, osmotic pressure builds up and inflow of water across the membrane causes it to yield and rupture.
Background	The resulting release of buoyant solution into the surrounding waterglass creates hollow, vertical structures (see left-hand side of Fig. 1).
Background	Their initiation and growth occurs in a matter of seconds to days depending on the salts employed.
Background	In some instances, small air bubbles are attached to the surface of the colloidal membrane.15,16
Background	The detachment and rise of a bubble entrains the inner solution in its wake, thus, directing the rapid growth of a thin, hollow needle.
Result	Several examples of tubes formed in this fashion are seen in Fig. 1.
Result	A magnified view of a bubble still attached to the stalk is shown in the inset.
Background	The variation in the diameter and length of the needle-like structures is related to the size of the bubble drawing the inner solution along.
Background	Large bubbles moving along straight trajectories create wide precipitation tubes that taper as the supply of solution is depleted.
Background	More erratic paths are sometimes observed for thin tubes created by smaller bubbles.
Problem	Here, we present a systematic investigation of bubble-guided tube growth.
Method	To allow quantitative variations of relevant control parameters, we have modified a recent method developed by Thouvenel-Romans et al.17,18
Method	In both cases, the seed crystals are replaced by a seed solution which is injected hydrodynamically at well-defined flow rates and concentrations.
Method	A solution of 0.5 M cupric sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O; Fisher) is injected into sodium silicate solutions (Na2SiO3·5H2O; Fisher) of various concentrations at 25 ± 1 °C.
Method	All solutions are prepared using nano-pure water (18 MΩ cm; EASYpure® UV, Barnstead).
Method	The injection rate of the aqueous cupric sulfate solution is controlled by a syringe pump (KD Scientific 200) and varied between 1–20 mL h−1.
Method	A glass capillary (length = 15 mm; inner diameter ≈ 1.1 mm) is used as a nozzle and delivers the cupric sulfate solution into a large, waterglass-filled cylinder (height ≈ 28 cm, inner diameter = 2.2 cm).
Method	A stainless steel needle (23G, Bevel B-D Yale) is introduced into the capillary with its tip slightly protruding out.
Method	The needle is connected to an air-filled syringe used to manually inject single air bubbles into the flow of cupric sulfate solution.
Method	Each bubble entrains the buoyant solution upward, forming a single tube of precipitate in its wake.
Method	Optical micrographs of the growth are acquired with a monochrome charged-coupled device camera (COHU 2122) connected to a PC via a frame grabber board (Data Translation, 640 × 480 pixels at 8 bit pixel−1).
Method	During the experiment, image sequences are captured using HLImage++97 software at a rate of typically 10 frame s−1.
Method	The images are then analyzed using in-house software.
Method	All measurements are corrected for optical deformations caused by the cylindrical geometry of the main reaction vessel.
Method	Samples are synthesized at a pump rate of Q = 7 mL h−1 using [CuSO4] = 0.5 M and [Na2SiO3] = 1.0 M. Collapsed tubes are produced at Q = 10–15 mL h−1 using [CuSO4] = 0.5 M and [Na2SiO3] = 2.5 M. The tubes generated are collected in a Petri dish filled with nano-pure water.
Method	The pieces of the tube are then rinsed three times and excess water is removed.
Method	The samples are dried at 45 °C overnight.
Result	Higher temperatures induce the degradation of the copper hydroxide precipitate to black copper oxide.
Method	The specimens are placed in a vacuum desiccator to remove remaining moisture.
Method	Then, they are either carbon coated or gold sputtered prior to acquiring micrographs using a JEOL JSM-5900 scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Background	In a recent publication, two of us have reported that the injection of cupric sulfate solution into sodium silicate solution leads to the formation of tubular structures.
Method	Three different growth regimes are distinguished.17
Method	(1) Jetting growth: At low concentrations of cupric sulfate solution, hydrodynamics dominates the formation of precipitation tubes by templating the membrane at the interface between the jetting fluid and the outer, denser liquid.
Method	The tube radii are described quantitatively by the Poiseuille-flow characteristics of the buoyant jet of injected solution.18
Method	(2) Popping growth: At intermediate concentrations, tubes grow in an oscillatory fashion.
Method	The tip of the tube is sealed by a colloidal membrane which stretches into a buoyant, membrane-bound droplet as solution delivery continues.
Method	When the material ruptures, this small solution-filled envelop is released and rises to the surface.
Method	This sequence repeats continuously with oscillation periods of approximately 1–12 s causing tube growth at speeds of 0.05–0.35 mm s−1.
Method	(3) Budding growth: For high concentrations of cupric sulfate, buoyancy forces are not large enough to remove the membrane-bound droplet from its hollow stalk.
Method	New growth appears through random breaches on the freshly formed membrane without ejection of material.
Method	Nonetheless, budding growth tends to be periodic yielding bulging but unbranched, hollow structures.
Method	Under budding conditions, the introduction of an air bubble at the interface between the two reactants emulates the bubble-guided growth shown in Fig. 1.
Method	As the bubble detaches from the syringe tip, it is released into the reaction zone between the two fluids and the air is trapped by a very thin colloidal copper hydroxide membrane.
Method	The buoyancy of the gas directs the growth upward.
Result	Fig. 2 shows an image sequence of a bubble rising in 1.0 M sodium silicate solution.
Result	In its wake, an initially translucent tube is rapidly forming.
Result	The bubble travels upward but remains anchored to the mouth of the structure.
Result	Sometimes, however, the bubble detaches and the system switches to its natural growth regime.
Result	We note that the gradual change between the upper translucent zone and the non-transparent blue stalk corresponds to fast formation of colloidal copper hydroxide and slower silica precipitation, respectively.
Result	This is in agreement with preliminary results from micro-Raman and EDS studies of the tube material, which detect predominantly copper hydroxide on the interior of the wall surface and amorphous silica on the outside.
Result	Our experiments show that the growth velocity of a tube is remarkably constant.
Result	This observation is exemplified by the data shown in Fig. 3 where the vertical coordinate h of three bubbles is plotted as a function of time.
Result	The bubbles’ velocities are obviously identical to the growth velocity of the tubes but smaller than the terminal velocity of free-rising bubbles.
Result	Notice that the height increases linearly over 4 to 6 cm which is approximately 100 times larger than the bubble and tube diameters.
Result	The origin h = 0 in the graph is situated 2 cm from the capillary outlet.
Result	At closer distances, transient fluctuations occur that are caused by momentum imparted to the bubble during its release.
Result	Moreover, as the bubble reaches the last few centimeters below the silicate solution/air interface, the growth velocity is no longer constant but increases rapidly and the radius of the tube decreases noticeably.
Conclusion	This acceleration is possibly caused by a gradient in fluid viscosity close to the meniscus of the silicate solution and/or the effects of the interface on the flow field.
Problem	Systematic measurements are carried out to obtain insights into the dependencies of the growth velocity v and the tube radius rtube on the injection rate Q and the bubble radius Rbubble.
Problem	A key question is whether the injected solution remains within the growing tube or leaks into the surrounding liquid without contributing to the volume increase of the structure.
Method	In the absence of such leaks, the flow rate Q should equal the tube’s rate of volume change.
Method	This yields the simple equation v = Q/πrtube2.
Result	Fig. 4 compares this relation with experimental data obtained for flow rates between 2 mL h−1 (solid triangles) and 10.0 mL h−1 (solid squares), and various bubble sizes.
Result	We find an overall good agreement between the experimental data and the latter equation (see solid lines in Fig. 5A,B).
Result	Least-square fitting of the data (see dashed lines in Fig. 4B) yields observed flow rates that are about 8% smaller than the pump rates employed (−7.0%, −8.0%, −4.4%, −12.5% and −8.3% for Q = 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, and 10.0 mL h−1, respectively).
Conclusion	These relatively small deviations indicate that most of the injected solution stays within the growing tube.
Conclusion	Consequently, the formation of new membrane material is sufficiently fast to avoid significant leakage.
Conclusion	Under our experimental conditions, the rate-determining factor of tube growth is therefore the inflow of seed solution and not the kinetics of membrane formation.
Result	Visual inspection readily shows that tube growth occurs in close vicinity to the bubble rather than at the tube’s base.
Problem	We characterize this crucial reaction zone by measuring the radii of both the bubble and the tube that forms in its trail.
Result	In this context, it is important to note that, within the resolution of our experiments, all bubbles had a simple spherical shape.
Result	Fig. 5A–D show the tube radii as a function of bubble size for four different silicate concentrations.
Result	Each plot presents data from experiments at flow rates of Q = 3, 5, 10 mL h−1 as solid circles, open squares and solid squares, respectively.
Result	For each data set, we find a nearly proportional dependence of rtube on Rbubble.
Result	We will therefore continue our discussion in terms of the corresponding radii ratio.
Result	Fig. 6 shows this ratio for four different silicate concentrations and three different flow rates.
Method	The concentration of cupric sulfate is kept constant at 0.5 M. We note that the radii ratio has a simple geometrical interpretation as it corresponds to the angle α between the boundary of the tube and the bubble surface (cos α = rtube/Rbubble); hence, the smaller the angle, the deeper the bubble sits in the mouth of the tube.
Method	Examples of small and large angles are shown in the left and right inset of Fig. 6, respectively.
Result	The data span the entire range of silicate concentrations (1.0–2.5 M) for which the bubbles are consistently creating simple tubes.
Result	Below 1.0 M, the membrane is tenuous and it is difficult to generate a bubble that drags the copper solution upward.
Result	Silicate concentrations above 2.5 M yield collapsing tubes.
Result	Fig. 6 shows that tube radii are only 5–20% smaller than the radii of their guiding bubbles.
Result	Within this range, the smallest ratios are found for the lowest flow rate of Q = 3 mL h−1.
Result	At this value, no significant dependence on silicate concentration is found.
Result	For Q = 10 mL h−1, however, the ratio increases with increasing silicate concentration and the contact angle decreases accordingly from about 30° to 20°.
Result	Moreover, we find that for a given silicate concentration, the radii ratio increases with increasing flow rate.
Result	This dependence is most pronounced for the highest silicate concentration (2.5 M).
Result	Our experiments also show that only bubbles of certain sizes are capable of guiding tubular growth.
Result	We only succeeded in creating tubes for bubbles with radii in the range of 150–600 μm.
Conclusion	Moreover, our experiments suggest that, with increasing flow rate, the minimal and maximal radii shift to larger values.
Result	Since the tube and the bubble radii are closely related, as we discussed in the earlier paragraphs, this trend is also reflected by the range of the data in Fig. 4.
Conclusion	The existence of a minimal and a maximal radius can be qualitatively argued in the context of competing forces.
Conclusion	The buoyancy acting on the air bubble scales as Rbubble3.
Conclusion	Two forces are counteracting buoyancy, namely a “sticking” force due to the contact between the membrane and the gas bubble and the Stokes force due to the viscosity of the silicate solution around the growing, bubble-guided tube.
Method	The Stokes force is proportional to ηoRbubblev = ηoRbubbleQ/(πrtube2) where ηo denotes the viscosity of the silicate solution.
Conclusion	Therefore, this force roughly scales as 1/Rbubble while the sticking force is likely to scale as Rbubble.
Conclusion	Accordingly, the buoyancy of very large bubbles is greater than the combined contributions from “sticking” and Stokes forces and the bubble detaches.
Conclusion	For very small bubbles, the Stokes force is dominant and the bubble cannot act as a sufficiently strong guide for the growing tube.
Conclusion	While this discussion motivates the existence of a finite range of radii in bubble-guided tube growth, more insights into the nature of the sticking force are needed.
Conclusion	We also note that the size, the shape and the position of the injection needle might affect measurements of minimal and maximal radii.
Result	The delicate force balance needed for bubble-guided tube growth can be easily upset.
Method	In Fig. 7A, a second smaller air bubble is injected deliberately into the growing tube.
Result	This bubble rises up the hollow tube and eventually collides with the leading bubble.
Result	When the two coalesce, the force balance is disturbed and the bubble is engulfed by the colloidal membrane.
Result	As more copper solution is delivered by the pump, the system transitions to its natural growth regime (budding) and the tube widens into the expected bulging structure.
Conclusion	The bubble has lost its ability to guide the tube’s growth.
Result	An example of a different outcome is shown in Fig. 7B.
Result	Here, the zone underneath the bubble begins to inflate, thus, stretching the sides of the tube.
Result	Nonetheless, the bubble is still attached to the top of the tube while the inflow of solution moves it from side to side.
Result	The lighter shades of gray at the thickest part of the bulge indicate thinning of the membrane or some newly produced material.
Conclusion	It appears that in this case the growth zone moved away from the bubble, thus, rendering the guide ineffective.
Conclusion	For the conditions of this particular experiment, the resulting structure is growing in the popping regime and, consequently, the top portion of the stalk and the attached bubble are released shortly after the time of the last snapshot.
Problem	Additional features of bubble-guided tube growth are unveiled by examining the tubes’ micrometre-scale features.
Problem	We investigate the morphology of the tube walls using scanning electron microscopy.
Method	Samples are prepared according to the procedures described in the experimental section.
Result	Fig. 8A shows a typical tubular structure attached to the dark background of a carbon tape.
Result	In this example, the tube radius is approximately 250 μm.
Result	The micrograph reveals stripes of different texture along the tube.
Result	For the given experimental parameters, the wavelength of the stripe pattern varies between 200 μm and 250 μm.
Result	We emphasize that these stripe patterns are also discernible on the inside surface as we observed numerous times during SEM studies of broken tube segments.
Result	At higher magnification (Fig. 8B), we can clearly discern two distinct surface textures that alternate within this stripe pattern.
Result	One appears dark and smooth (see upper left-hand corner of Fig. 8B) while the other one is lighter with a coarse, grainy appearance (lower right-hand corner).
Result	Additional features include blister-like structures (typical diameter 50 μm), most of which flank the transition regions within the stripe pattern.
Conclusion	One can envision a variety of different mechanisms that may cause the observed stripe patterns on bubble-guided tubes.
Conclusion	These include oscillatory phenomena within or around the primary reaction zone (e.g., periodic rupturing of the freshly formed membrane material), Liesegang-like processes that influence the relevant precipitation reactions, and shape oscillations of the guiding gas bubble.
Conclusion	Any oscillatory mechanism acting during the growth process corresponds to a characteristic frequency that can be calculated from the growth velocity of the tube and the wavelength of the stripe pattern.
Result	For the example shown in Fig. 8, the growth speed of 1.0 cm s−1 and the stripe distance of about 250 μm correspond to a frequency of approximately 40 Hz.
Result	Inspection of several other samples yields frequencies in the range of 30–90 Hz.
Conclusion	However, further interpretations require more systematic measurements and a thorough characterization of compositional variations throughout the striped wall material.
Result	Another intriguing phenomenon is observed for high silicate concentrations (≥2.5 M), which correspond to large density differences between the dense silicate and the lighter cupric sulfate solution.
Result	Under these experimental conditions, we observe that the bubble-guided tubes collapse.
Result	This process yields twisted ribbon-like structures.
Result	A typical example for these collapsed tubes is shown in Fig. 9A.
Result	The ribbon is approximately 1.5 mm wide and has five well-defined twists within the field of view.
Result	Accordingly, the structure has a pitch of about 6 mm.
Result	Fig. 9B and 9C show scanning electron micrographs of a collapsed tube.
Result	The overall morphology of the sample is more rugged than in the case of the uncollapsed structures (cf., Fig. 8).
Result	Also the characteristic stripe pattern appears to be absent although very coarse ring-like ridges are found.
Result	The outer wall surfaces of the collapsed tube also reveals numerous blisters and the twist is easily discernible as a large fold.
Result	Some of the barnacle-like blisters feature little spirals such as the very left one in Fig. 9C.
Result	Tube collapse occurs after several centimetres of ordinary, cylindrical growth, but our experiments did not reveal a well-defined critical length.
Result	Typically the structure flattens and twists nearly simultaneously with the entire collapse requiring only a few seconds.
Result	In the following, the bubble-guided growth process continues but the resulting precipitation structure forms as a twisted ribbon.
Result	This observation reveals that the collapsed state still allows internal flow of solution.
Result	We also observed that stopping and restarting of the pump can induce a transition back to the cylindrical or a near cylindrical state.
Conclusion	This phenomenon of “re-inflation” indicates that the growth of the collapsed structure is actually cylindrical in close vicinity of the bubble.
Conclusion	The collapse of precipitation tubes is obviously related to an increased density difference Δρ = ρo − ρi between the outer silicate (‘o’) and the inner cupric sulfate solution (‘i’).
Conclusion	Assuming mechanical equilibrium at the top of the growing tube, one obtains the hydrostatic pressure difference Δp = Δρgh across the membrane, where g and h denote earth’s acceleration and the vertical distance from the growth zone, respectively.
Conclusion	This transmural pressure difference exerts a compressive force on the cylindrical tube.
Conclusion	In the actual growth experiment, flow within the structure contributes an opposing pressure that follows the Hagen-Poiseuille equation Δp = (8ηihQ)/(πrtube4) where ηi is the viscosity of the cupric sulfate solution.
Conclusion	If one further assumes that the freshly formed wall does not resist a possible collapse, one obtains the simple stability criterion (8ηiQ)/(πΔρgrtube4) > 1.
Conclusion	We therefore expect that collapse occurs for low flow rates, large density differences and large radii.
Conclusion	This conclusion is in qualitative agreement with the observation that structures grown at Q = 10 mL h−1 are stable if the tube radii are less than approximately 450 μm whereas wider tubes collapse.
Conclusion	However, the predicted critical radius for Q = 10 mL h−1, ηi = 1.21 cP, and Δρ = 0.2 g cm−3 is 250 μm and, hence, smaller than the observed value.
Conclusion	This difference could be the result of a certain rigidity of the tube material and/or indicate a small but non-zero pressure difference between the inner and outer solutions at the reaction zone.
Conclusion	While our qualitative discussion motivates some of the dependencies relating to tube collapse, it does not explain the occurrence of the striking helical twist that accompanies the flattening of the structure.
Conclusion	However, this feature is observed for nearly all collapsing tubes.
Conclusion	We suggest that the twisting motion is a secondary aspect of the collapse that reflects the mechanical characteristics of the tube material; in particular, its gradient-like vertical and radial composition as well as the specific boundary conditions that immobilize the lower end while allowing unconstrained motion of the upper extremity.
Conclusion	In summary, this study provides the first quantitative insights into the rapid growth dynamics of tubular precipitation structures guided by buoyant gas bubbles.
Conclusion	The tube radii are controlled primarily by the radius of the rising bubble.
Conclusion	Based on this simple radius selection, the system determines its growth velocity following volume conservation of the injected reactant solution.
Conclusion	Moreover, cylindrical tubes collapse to helical ribbons if the density difference across the tube wall is large enough to cause compressive pressure that outbalances flow-induced and other stabilizing forces.
Conclusion	A key question that remains unanswered concerns the nature of the adhesive contact between the gas bubble and the forming copper hydroxide membrane at the tip of the tube.
Conclusion	Failure to establish or maintain a proper contact results in slow tubular growth that is not templated by the bubble.
Conclusion	Our experiments suggest that such a situation occurs outside of a finite range of bubble radii.
Conclusion	In particular, large bubbles are lifted out of the reaction zone due to their pronounced buoyancy.
Conclusion	This process appears to be related to the pinning of bubbles to solid walls or interfaces between immiscible liquids.
Conclusion	In our experiments, however, this situation is complicated by the unknown flow and concentration fields around the upper portion of the growing structure.
Conclusion	Nonetheless, it appears likely that bubbles stick to the reaction zone due to surface tension.
Conclusion	Consequently, more detailed measurements of the upper, critical radius might allow the characterization of transient surface tensions.
Conclusion	Such measurements could provide useful data concerning the early stages of the formation of colloidal membranes.
Conclusion	Our findings are of additional importance as they relate to a wide class of precipitation systems in which radial gradient fields orchestrate the formation of permanent, tubular structures.
Conclusion	As described in the Introduction, these systems span through a diverse range of fields including electrochemistry, materials science, geology and also biomineralization.19,20
Conclusion	Our investigation is the first step towards the development of methodologies that will allow us to template, guide, and control the formation of precipitation structures in diverse systems.
Conclusion	Such approaches not only will reveal underlying universalities but could potentially lead to novel materials and devices.

Problem	Role of water molecules in the KcsA protein channel by molecular dynamics calculations
Problem	Molecular dynamics simulations supported by electrostatic calculations have been conducted on the KcsA channel to determine the role of water molecules in the pore.
Problem	Starting from the X-ray structure of the KcsA channel in its closed state at 2.0 Å resolution, the opening of the pore towards a conformation built on the basis of EPR results is studied.
Result	We show that water molecules act as a structural element for the K+ ions inside the filter and the hydrophobic cavity of the channel.
Result	In the filter, water tends to enhance the depth of the wells occupied by the K+ ions, while in the cavity there is a strong correlation between the water molecules and the cavity ion.
Conclusion	As a consequence, the protein remains very stable in the presence of three K+ ions in the selectivity filter and one in the cavity.
Conclusion	The analysis of the dynamics of water molecules in the cavity reveals preferred orientations of the dipoles along the pore axis, and a correlated behavior between this dipole orientation and the displacement of the K+ ion during the gating process.
Background	The equilibrium and dynamical properties of a solvent in confined geometry can be very different from those in the bulk.1–3
Background	This is particularly important in the case of confined environments present in proteins, such as the interior of deep crevices, pockets or other poorly accessible regions.
Background	Prominent examples include the substrate binding sites of enzymes4 and the narrow pores of membrane channels.3
Background	Simulation studies of a number of channel models with cylindrical shapes have suggested that the average dynamical properties of water molecules in a protein pore differ substantially from those in bulk water, exhibiting in particular decreased translational and rotational mobility.3,5–7
Background	Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used to simulate the behavior of water molecules located between two planar hydrophobic surfaces8 or within cylindrical and spherical cavities.9,10
Background	These studies have shown that water confined in such molecular sized volumes displays a greater degree of order than in bulk, with the formation of distinct layers of molecules parallel to the surfaces.
Background	This confinement changes the dielectric constant of the solvent which, in turn, influences the effective electrostatic field within the liquid.11
Background	The situation becomes more complicated when we consider ionic channels since, in addition to the influence of the confinement due to the specific geometry of the polypeptide chains,5 much larger variations of the dielectric constant are obtained due to the solvation of ions, like K+, present in the channel.12–14
Background	There are few experimental measurements of the solvent dielectric constant within a protein pore.
Background	Let us cite for instance experimental studies of a water pool confined in reverse micelles and biological pores, which have revealed a substantial decrease of polarization15,16 and a dramatic slowing of the rate of relaxation of water molecules.17–19
Background	The behavior of water molecules bound within a cyclodextrine cycle has also been found to be very different from that in bulk water.20,21
Background	Due to these specific properties relating dielectric behavior and confinement, water is becoming more and more understood as a structuring element in proteins, and ab initio calculations have been used to prove this feature.
Background	Frey and Cleland 22,23 have reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that short and strong hydrogen bonds could provide at least five orders of magnitude in rate acceleration of enzymatic catalysis.
Background	Green24 has proposed that a partially charged H5O2 group could strongly block a voltage-gated channel by preventing motions of transmembrane helices.
Background	In this paper we refer to a pH-gated K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans,25–28 the KcsA channel.
Background	The past few years have witnessed the determination of the structure of several species of ion channels by X-ray diffraction29,30 and by cryoelectron microscopy.31,32
Background	In particular, there has been substantial advances in the structural determination of potassium channels.
Background	Combined with a large number of numerical studies,33–43 these structures provide an opportunity to relate atomic resolution structures (3.2 and 2.0 Å resolution for KcsA) to their various physiological functions (selectivity, gating, permeation, etc)..44–46
Background	In previous studies, we have built a model for the open and closed structures of KcsA based on the 2.0 Å resolution structure.47–49
Background	We have conducted MD simulations based on the idea that this channel could support several K+ ions in its pore.12
Background	Based on simplified arguments, four K+ ions were assumed to occupy the pore, being alternately separated by water molecules.
Background	Their locations were chosen to be consistent with the sites determined experimentally.27
Background	This so-called KWKWK…K sequence was proved to be stable over nanosecond time scales in either the closed or open state of the channel.47,48
Problem	In this paper, we try to explain this choice in a more quantitative way by investigating the structural role of the protein and water on the K+ ions properties.
Background	The specific dynamical behavior of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity found in KcsA has been described for the closed conformation of the pore.3,6,50
Problem	We have conducted similar studies and tried to elucidate the correlation between the motions of the K+ ions located in the cavity with the orientation of the water molecule in the closed and open structures.
Background	The complexity of ion channels is such that information extracted from computational models can greatly contribute to the refinement of our understanding of their physiological properties in the cell and de facto to better apprehend ion channel diseases.
Method	MD simulations on protein with explicit solvents and membranes and Brownian dynamics33–43 based on a simplified description of the pore have been used to study ion permeation at the microscopic level.
Method	Nonetheless all these models, at any level, contain more or less severe approximations.
Method	In particular, it is well known that electrostatics plays a dominant role for the protein structure and function including transmembrane architectures.
Method	Macroscopic continuum electrostatic models, in which the solvent is described as a structureless dielectric medium, are particularly useful to reveal the dominant energetic factors related to ion permeation, but they occult the specific role of individual water molecules in confined zones.
Problem	This is what we want to stress by using KcsA, which is a nice example as it exhibits different types of water pockets.
Background	In this section, we briefly describe our KcsA models for the open and closed states and the MD protocols we used.
Background	Details can be found elsewhere.47–49
Method	We have built open and closed state models of the KcsA channel on the basis of experimental results.
Background	The closed conformation of KcsA, as revealed by X-ray experiments at 100 K, is a tetramer formed by four outer helices M1, pore helices P and inner helices M2 (Fig. 1).
Background	Three main regions appear in this protein.
Background	The narrowest part of the pore, formed by the backbone carbonyl oxygens of the amino acid sequence TVGYG (Thr75–Val76–Gly77–Tyr78–Gly79), acts as a selectivity filter (F) for the K+ ions.
Background	It extends over about 12 Å with a mean radius of 1.4 Å.
Background	At the membrane center, the size of the pore increases to form a 5 Å radius hydrophobic cavity (C).
Background	The gate (G), which is a thin hydrophobic region formed by the inner M2 helix bundle, closes the channel with a zone of small radius (about 1.6 Å) on the intracellular side.
Background	Very little is known about the open state of KcsA and the relationship between the structure and gating mechanism.
Background	Homology modeling with MthK and KvAP,51–53 which are nicely representative of the open state of the KcsA pore conformation, could have been used as a starting basic structure.
Background	Also, direct experiments on KcsA using site-directed labeling and EPR spectroscopy allowed the visualization of the structural rearrangements of the intracellular M2 helices in the process from closed to open state.54–56
Background	The crystallized structure of KcsA (1JQ2), averaged over 50 protein configurations was improved by additional energy minimization using molecular mechanics to obtain the 1JQ1 structure.
Background	Three main experimental conformations (homology based structures, 1JQ2 and 1JQ1) could thus be considered as starting structures in an optimization process to reach a stable open state for KcsA.
Method	Although none of these structures are totally resolved, 1JQ1 has been chosen as being the most representative.
Background	Moreover, the positions of several Cα atoms of M2 helices occurring in the gate region are known in a precise way (Leu86 to Gln119 for the first monomer and their analogues in the other three monomers).
Method	We have thus built a model of the open structure combining the Cα known skeleton positions of the open structure derived from EPR experiments and the well-defined closed structure modeled on the basis of X-ray data.49
Background	The diameter of the narrowest part of the gate in the permeation path was estimated to be about 5 Å.
Background	Nevertheless, there is currently a controversy with respect to this value which seems, on the view of Brownian dynamics results,57 too small to allow for fast K+ diffusion motions comparable to experimental observations.
Method	The lipid bilayer of the cellular membrane (hydrophobic area) is mimicked by an octane box.36,47
Method	Of course octane molecules are not amphiphilic and cannot reproduce all the properties of a real membrane aligned phospholipids bilayer (e.g. different viscosity, stability, interactions with the protein) but both have nearly the same density and exhibit the same hydrophobic character.
Method	The extracellular and intracellular sides of the octane box are formed by slabs of water molecules of 22 Å thickness.
Method	We have already stressed that we must distinguish the behavior of the water molecules belonging to the intra- and extracellular areas from that of the molecules which hydrate the cavity.
Method	Therefore we fixed the density of bulk water in the extra- and intracellular sides to 1, while the density of water molecules in the cavity was determined by evaluating the Connolly surface.58
Method	As a consequence a bulk water molecule, which occupies on average a volume of 30 Å3 at 300 K, has its mobility appreciably reduced in the cavity.
Method	This is correlated to a strong increase in water density (≥1).
Method	The cavity could thus contain between 30 and 40 water molecules.35,47
Method	The fluctuations of this number initially optimized in the closed state of KcsA were studied during the gating of the channel, in consistency with the conditions required for the hydration properties of potassium ion.
Method	Indeed MD studies using the 3.2 Å resolution structure have shown13,42 that the K+ ion retrieves its complete solvation shell (8 water molecules) when the cavity is filled by at least 30 water molecules.
Method	As already mentioned, the pore axis at the filter level contains both K+ ions and water molecules.
Method	Among the seven ionic sites observed in the 2.0 Å resolution structure27 (2 extracellular sites Sext and S0 and 5 sites S1 to Scav) inside the channel, we deal with sites S0 to Scav because Sext only appears at high K+ concentration.
Method	Inside the filter, the filling sequence alternates, with two K+ ions being separated by a water molecule in order to increase the solvation of the K+ ions.35,59
Background	Although this quasi-linear sequence remains intuitive, its existence could be better understood by considering a steric effect (the K+ radius and the average radius of a water molecule are close, equal to 1.33 and 1.41 Å, respectively) and the strong repulsive interaction occurring between nearest neighbor K+ ions.
Method	On the basis of such qualitative arguments, our sequence KWKWK…K was composed of 2 water molecules (named W1 and W3) in the S1 and S3 sites and 4 potassium ions (1 extracellular, K0, 2 ions inside the filter, K2 and K4, and 1 in the cavity, Kcav, otherwise filled by water molecules) at the S0, S2, S4 and Scav crystallographic sites, respectively.
Method	The simulations were performed with the AMBER suite of programs using the AMBER6 force field.60
Method	The open and closed conformations were relaxed over at least 1 ns so that local minima could be ruled out.47–49
Method	The water molecules were described by the parameters of the TIP3P model.61
Method	Time steps of 1 fs were required to describe all external movements, including the water rotations.
Method	For the closed state, we have first proceeded with the solvent (water + octane) dynamics at 300 K in order to optimize the environment of the protein, the latter being frozen in its crystallized structure.
Method	In a second step, MD of the protein has been performed by increasing progressively the temperature up to 300 K during ≈200 ps.
Method	This simulation was continued in the (NVT) and (NPT) ensembles during 3.4 additional ns in order to follow the approach proposed by Bernèche et al.35
Background	This time was shown to be sufficient to reach equilibrium for the protein built on the basis of the 3.2 Å resolution structure.13,42
Method	The temperature was maintained to a constant value using Berendsen’s thermal coupling62 at 1 fs relaxation time.
Method	Targeted MD was conducted during about 3 ns to find an open state structure of the protein.48,49
Method	Starting from the experimental structure 1JQ1 discussed previously, containing the KWKWK…K sequence, we progressively increased a constraint applied to each Cα atom, for reaching the open conformation.48
Method	This conformation was finally relaxed by releasing the constraint partially, then totally.
Method	This approach displays two main advantages over previous simulations already devoted to the gating of the KcsA channel:39,41 (i) the refined structure of the protein contains 24 additional aminoacids at the intracellular side of the membrane, which are pointed out here as dominant for the gating mechanism; (ii) the gating mechanism is monitored step by step as a function of the constraint in an all-atom description of the pore.
Result	As shown in Fig. 1, the filter is not affected by the opening process, whereas the M2 helices participate strongly in it.
Result	During the relaxation, the filter remains stable while M1 and M2 helices tend to move slightly toward closing, indicating that the pore is still significantly opened after 1.5 ns (remember that the experimental gating occurs on a millisecond time scale).
Method	The energy profiles have been obtained by calculating the potential energy of a positive (+1e) probe charge mimicking the K+ ion displaced adiabatically along the central (z) axis of the pore.
Method	Lennard-Jones interactions between the protein atoms, water molecules and potassium ions have also been added.
Method	Energy minimization at a given z position was made along the other directions perpendicular to the channel axis in order to follow the most favorable energetic pathway.
Method	The components of the dipole moment generated by the set of water molecules in the cavity were determined by following the orientation of all of these water molecules.
Method	The projection μz of the dipole moment of each water molecule onto the z axis could then be calculated.
Method	Note that for an ideal TIP3P water molecule, the dipole moment is equal to 2.35 D.
Background	Quantum calculations have been performed on a model of the selectivity filter containing 304 atoms.63
Method	We truncated the KcsA structure at the level of the four Tyr78 residues, where the peptide bond with Gly79 was cut and ended with a hydrogen (–CHO), while near the cavity below the four Thr74, –NH of the amide bond was completed in NH2.
Method	The portion of the sequence considered was thus (Thr74–Thr75–Val76–Gly77–Tyr78)4.
Method	The atomic positions were issued from MD relaxed structures.
Method	No further energy minimization was done, in order to be strictly consistent with the MD results as for the geometries.
Method	No lipidic or water environment constitutive of the MD construct was considered.
Method	We used GAUSSIAN03 suite of programs64 to evaluate the electrostatic potential.
Method	Partial charges were fitted to reproduce the electrostatic potential surface using 6-31G(d) Hartree–Fock wave functions, with constraint of total charge conservation and following the Merz–Kollman–Singh scheme.65,66
Background	Determining partial charges is in general a difficult task.
Background	However, Merz–Kollman–Singh population analysis was proved to be efficient in determining such charges since it takes into account several molecular properties66.
Result	Fig. 2 shows the trajectories of the centers of mass of the K+ ions and of the water molecules in the KWKWK…K sequence observed in the relaxed closed (Fig. 2a) and open (Fig. 2b) structures during 3.6 and 1.6 ns of the MD production run, respectively.
Result	Four main features can be extracted from these trajectories.
Result	First, the species located in the filter are strongly bound to the protein since they do not move significantly.
Result	Indeed, in the closed state, the motions of W1, K2, W3 and K4 are contained on average in spheres of diameters ranging between 2.7 and 4 Å.
Result	This behavior has been corroborated in our previous studies47 by the calculation of the root mean square displacements (rmsd).
Result	These display very low values, from 0.5 Å in NVT conditions to 1.3 Å in NPT conditions, indicating very confined positions.
Result	Second, it should be noted that the spheres belonging to the trajectories of two adjacent species overlap.
Result	This does not mean that repulsive interactions always occur but rather shows that the atoms move in the filter in a concerted manner.
Result	Indeed, a close examination of the time dependent correlation functions of their instantaneous positions already confirmed these concerted motions within the KWKWK…K file.47
Result	The third main feature concerns the Kcav ion, which undergoes much larger motions.
Result	In the closed state, its trajectory extends over 9.8 Å along the pore axis and 7.2 Å in the perpendicular directions.
Result	In the open state, similar trends are obtained with the respective values 11.8 Å along the pore axis and 9.1 Å in the other directions.
Result	Fourth, and perhaps most notable, the average location of the Kcav ion changes between the two structures.
Result	While in the closed state, this K+ ion remains on average close to the cavity site, i.e. located at the upper part of the cavity as determined experimentally, but it shifts down toward the intracellular side of the cavity in the open configuration.
Result	The difference between the center of gravity of the Kcav trajectories in the two situations (closed and open) is equal to about 5.4 Å.
Conclusion	Finally, let us mention that the large dispersion in the K0 and W1 locations observed at the outer mouth of the open structure when compared to the closed state may indicate an escape of these species from the pore.
Problem	In this section, we analyze the structuring role of water in the filter and the cavity.
Result	Fig. 3 shows the potential energy created by the protein alone in the open and closed conformations calculated along the z axis by minimization of the displacement of a K+ ion.
Result	Since the filter does not exhibit strong deformation upon gating, this energy is nearly the same in the two conformations.
Result	The curves display a deep well in the filter, with a structured shape at the well bottom, indicating the presence of sites.
Result	In the cavity and gate regions, no stable site is found for the two conformations, the main difference being obtained for the height of the barrier at the gate, which decreases by about 2 eV in the open state.
Result	Fig. 4 exhibits the potential energy created by the filter at various z positions of a single K+ ion for the closed conformation of the protein.
Result	The energy has been calculated for the protein alone with three different methods to test their accuracy.
Result	The first curve (black dots) corresponds to the potential energy extracted directly from ab initio calculations.
Result	The second (dark grey line, blue in the html) is calculated on the basis of the Merz–Kollman charges derived from this ab initio potential while the last (light grey line, red in the html) is derived directly from the AMBER force field parameters (see Fig. 3).
Result	Fig. 4 reveals that all the three methods display the same behavior, namely a deep structured well at the center of the filter.
Conclusion	Similar depths and shapes for the wells obtained from the three methods reinforce the fact that the semi-empirical force fields used in MD simulations are reasonable enough to describe the protein environment from the point of view of the potential energy.
Problem	We will therefore discuss our results on the basis of the AMBER force field, since ab initio calculations are in practice too time consuming for systems containing more than 300 atoms.
Conclusion	Although the secondary minima are more or less pronounced according to the method, this comparison clearly demonstrates that the well depth is mostly due to the electrostatic interactions between the ion and the 8 carbonyl groups coming from Val55 and Gly56 in their neighboring environment.
Conclusion	Indeed, the position of the minima correspond exactly in the three cases to the sites S0, S2 and S4 determined by MD.
Conclusion	However it would be premature to claim at this stage that the protein field determines fully the sites and one fundamental aspect is to precisely define the influence of water.
Result	Fig. 5 exhibits the potential energy (calculated with the AMBER force field) when two water molecules W1 and W3 are included in the filter at their preferred sites S1 and S3, and in addition when the cavity is hydrated.
Result	Comparison of the curves including or not the presence of water in the filter and cavity reveals its structuring role.
Result	Indeed the previous locations are clearly reinforced by the presence of the two water molecules in S1 and S3 since the energy experienced by the ions in sites S2 and S4 decreases by at least 0.5 eV.
Result	Even more indicative is the reinforcement of site S0 as well as the occurrence of a new site corresponding exactly to the Scav position.
Result	The presence of S0 is enhanced by the W1 water molecule.
Conclusion	The occurrence of Scav would be due to an organization of the water molecules and to the influence on the protein environment itself, both inducing the corresponding well.
Conclusion	As a short conclusion to this section, one can say that the water molecules in these confined positions (filter and cavity) undoubtedly play a dominant structuring role for the K+ crossing the channel.
Conclusion	They act first by enhancing the structure of the stable filter sites for the potassium ions, already partially outlined by the field of the protein alone, and second by revealing the cavity and S0 sites.
Conclusion	It should also be noted that the sites S1 and S3 were found stable in the closed state of the pore, on the time scale of our simulation, only if one K additional site is present in the cavity42.
Result	In Fig. 6, the time evolution of the components of the total dipole moment of the water molecules located in the cavity, defined as the geometrical sum of all individual H2O dipoles, is shown for the closed and open states.
Result	A positive sign for μz means that the dipole is oriented along the pore axis towards the extracellular side.
Conclusion	This quite noisy evolution is due to several factors: the atom fluctuations in the protein, the Kcav motions and the thermal fluctuations in the orientational motions of light water molecules at 300 K. However, we can note that the dipoles projected along the directions perpendicular to the pore axis get close to zero on average while the component along the z axis reaches finite values.
Result	A relatively stable mean value of −10 D is obtained for the closed conformation while a +11 D value is reached in the open state with, however, much larger fluctuations and thus relatively large standard deviations from the average value.
Conclusion	As a consequence, we expect for the open situation a large fluctuating electric field promoted by the water dipoles in the cavity.
Background	In order to interpret these features, different hypotheses can be drawn.
Conclusion	These finite values can be due to the dynamics of confined waters which cannot rotate freely in this hydrophobic pocket.
Conclusion	This could also be due to the electric field created by the protein which would tend to orient the dipoles along a given direction.
Conclusion	Finally, the field induced by the Kcav ion may also play an important role.
Problem	Furthermore, we studied the electric field induced by the protein alone along the pore axis (not shown).
Problem	This quantity can be viewed as the gradient of the potential energy discussed previously (Fig. 3).
Result	Similar behaviors are obtained for the closed and open conformations.
Result	However, a large difference occurs at the gate region where a global inversion of the electric field can be observed.
Conclusion	Indeed for the closed structure, mainly positive values of the field indicate that K+ ions will be pushed toward the cavity.
Conclusion	On the contrary, K+ ions will be pushed toward the intracellular side in the open state since the electric field exhibits mostly negative values.
Conclusion	This feature corroborates the fact that two positions of Kcav are observed in the MD simulations, namely in the upper (closed state) or lower (open state) part of the cavity (Fig. 2), which is certainly also linked to the different mean orientations of the water molecule dipoles in the cavity.
Problem	A closer examination of the dynamical behavior of the water molecules leads to another interesting feature.
Result	Fig. 7 characterizes the dependence of the z component of the total dipole of water molecules in the cavity vs. the Kcav motions along the z axis of the cavity.
Result	This component μz clearly follows the behavior of Kcav, being relatively stable when Kcav does not move and, on the contrary, changing its value with the ion motion.
Conclusion	As a consequence, the orientational motions of the water molecules are more or less characterized by the ion dynamics.42
Conclusion	Similar conclusions apply to the open channel with, however, larger fluctuations for K+ displacement and water dipole component values.
Problem	To demonstrate such a correlation between the water dipole and the Kcav motions along the z axis, we have drawn (bottom of Fig. 7) the behavior of μzvs. the position z of the ion center of mass in the cavity.
Result	We see three sets of points for the closed and open conformations which describe relatively well the coupled behavior μzvs. z (K+ position).
Result	In the closed state, the ion Kcav is mainly located at the upper side of the cavity around 41.5 ± 1 Å, and the corresponding dipole due to water molecules in the cavity takes values which range between 0 and −20 D, with a mean value around −10 D, as already given.
Result	The center of the cavity, around 38 ± 1 Å, is much less occupied by the K+ ion and corresponds to a dipole ranging between −10 and +10 D with a vanishing mean value.
Result	The third region at the lower side of the cavity (35 ± 1 Å) is still less explored by the ion and it leads to a positive dipole whose value fluctuates significantly.
Result	In the open state, we recover the three regions, but with an occupation for the K+ ion which is totally reversed.
Result	Indeed, the ion remains mainly located at the bottom of the cavity (≈31–34 Å) and the water dipole is clearly positive.
Result	The other two regions correspond either to a K+ location close to the center of the cavity (around 37–38 Å) or to the gate region (around 29 Å), with positive values for the water dipole, respectively small (around 0 D) and large (20–25 D), respectively.
Result	The distribution of points describing μz (z(K+)) displays a relatively large standard deviation, with regard to the straight lines (Fig. 7).
Result	These lines would correspond to vanishing fluctuations in the correlation between μz and z(K+).
Result	Fig. 8 shows snapshots of the pore in the closed and open states.
Result	We can see an illustrative example of what we described before.
Result	The two K+ ions in the filter are similarly located in the two states while the Kcav ion occupies drastically different positions.
Result	A striking feature is the location of the water molecules in the cavity.
Result	In the first situation (closed state), they are all located below the ion, and thus hydrate it only partially.
Result	This means that preferential binding occurs with the innermost part of the filter, with the resulting water dipole component μz taking a strongly negative value (−19 D).
Result	On the contrary, in the second situation (open state), the water molecules are more equally distributed around the ion, due to the pore opening, and the corresponding dipole value becomes strongly positive (+33 D)(i.e. toward the extracellular side).
Result	In the open state, some water molecules are also located in the gate part, suggesting entry or exit from the cavity, while no similar behavior is observed in the closed state.
Problem	In order to study the influence of the gating mechanism, which initiates relatively large motions of the K+ ion in the cavity, on the behavior of the water molecules motions, we have calculated (Fig. 9) the variation of the number of H2O molecules present in the cavity.
Background	Here, we have to define the limits of the cavity.
Method	We considered that the upper side of the cavity corresponds to Thr74 while the lower side ends at the Ala108 residue.
Method	In the closed state, this number is nearly constant and equal to about 31 (not shown).
Result	The relaxation process which follows the constrained opening induces some perturbations at the beginning of the simulation run, resulting in a large fluctuation of the number from 22 to 30.
Result	These perturbations disappear after 0.5 ns of simulation to display a constant number of water molecules (around 32 H2O) in the cavity.
Result	At about 1 ns, we see that the Kcav ion, which was located close to the gate, has moved up toward the top of the cavity (Fig. 7b), and this leads to an increase in the number of H2O molecules (38 instead of 32).
Result	This value then fluctuates between 32 and 38, depending on the position of Kcav in the cavity.
Result	Some examples of the behavior of the center of mass of some water molecules vs. simulation time in the open state are illustrated in Fig. 10.
Result	The first example concerns a water molecule which remains inside the cavity during the simulation time.
Result	In the second example, the molecule initially located in the gate region enters the cavity after 0.4 ns and remains confined inside.
Result	The third example corresponds to a molecule which exits the cavity after an initial ≈0.4 ns stay at its lower limit toward the intracellular medium.
Result	In the last example, the water molecule inside the cavity leaves.
Result	A striking behavior can be observed for all the water molecules which migrate in or outside the cavity: there is a transit residence time varying between 0.2 and 0.4 ns, i.e. a plateau for z vs. time when entering or exiting the cavity, near its lower limit.
Result	Let us mention that in the open relaxed state, among the 40 water molecules located in the filter + cavity + reservoir (on each side of KcsA), only 28 are conserved over the 1.5 ns simulation time, while 12 water molecules have been replaced by others initially located in the intracellular region.
Conclusion	This remark shows the great mobility of water in the open pore.
Problem	Finally, it is also interesting to correlate the motions of the water molecules inside the cavity with those of Kcav ion.
Problem	The distance between the centers of mass of the two species has been studied for most of the water molecules.
Result	In Fig. 11 we illustrate the behavior of this distance with time for one water molecule.
Result	The minimum distance DOK ≈ 2.8 Å corresponds to the radius of the first sphere of solvation for the Kcav ion (mean distance between the centers of mass of K+ and oxygen atoms).
Result	We see that the water molecule spends a rather long time in this sphere, but it can also rapidly move far away from the ion, to distances that can reach 8–12 Å.
Result	Such values for this mutual distance correspond to opposite locations in the cavity for the two species K+ and H2O.
Conclusion	This feature is reproduced for most of the other water molecules in the cavity (not shown), indicating that solvation is a very dynamical process, i.e. there are permanent exchanges of water molecules in the solvation spheres.
Conclusion	We have shown that MD simulations complemented by arguments based on an electrostatic description of the protein can help to deepen our understanding of the role played by water molecules confined in the filter and the cavity of a KcsA pore.
Conclusion	With regard to the formation of the K+ ion sites and the dynamics of the ions, interesting features have also been obtained by comparing the behavior of water in the closed and open conformations of the pore.
Conclusion	First, we demonstrated that water in the filter reinforces the potential wells’ signature of the K+ sites in the sequence KWKWK…K.
Conclusion	Second, we observed that the water dipole orientations in the cavity are strongly correlated with the motions of the Kcav ion.
Conclusion	This correlation nevertheless does not prevent water molecules from entering or exiting the cavity when the protein conformation changes (through opening or relaxation of the M2 helices at the gate), and water diffusion proceeds by always keeping an optimal shell of oxygen atoms around the K+ ions.
Conclusion	A yet deeper insight to describe in a more explicit way the interactions between water, protein and K+ ions could be provided (i) by the use of ab initio calculations and (ii) by considering the water diffusion over much longer times, which would require other numerical methods than MD, and would also allow the study of the variation of the number of water molecules in the cavity during the closing process.

Problem	Photodissociation dynamics of pyrrole: Evidence for mode specific dynamics from conical intersections
Problem	The H and D atom elimination mechanisms in the photodissociation of jet cooled pyrrole and pyrrole-d1 have been studied by photofragment velocity map imaging.
Method	The molecules were excited to the 1 1A2 (πσ*) state at λ = 243 nm and to the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state at λ = 217 nm.
Method	H/D atoms were detected by (2 + 1) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) at λ = 243 nm.
Result	The analysis of the images and the resulting translational energy distributions from the 1 1A2 state demonstrates the existence of two decay pathways, fast mode-specific cleavage of the NH bond in the excited state (channel A) and internal conversion (IC) to the electronic ground state (S0) followed by unimolecular decomposition of the vibrationally hot S0 molecules (channel B).
Result	The angular distributions of the H/D atoms from the direct dissociation in the excited state are strongly anisotropic, whereas the decay of the S0 molecules leads to spatially isotropic distributions.
Result	The results at λ = 217 nm indicate that the 1 1B2 state undergoes an ultrafast radiationless transition to 1 1A2 followed by the abovementioned direct mode-specific NH bond fission on the 1 1A2 potential energy surface (channel A′) or conversion to S0 and subsequent unimolecular decomposition (channel B′).
Result	The latter pathway may also be initiated by a direct relaxation from 1 1B2 to S0.
Result	The anisotropy parameter of β ≈ –1 for the direct NH bond fission at λ = 217 nm is in accordance with the expectations for a perpendicular electronic excitation and a dissociation lifetime that is short compared to the rotational period of the molecules.
Conclusion	The fast decay dynamics of both excited electronic states can be rationalized with reference to the theoretically predicted conical intersections between the ππ*, πσ*, and S0 potential energy surfaces and the antibonding nature of the πσ* potential energy surface with respect to the NH bond [A. L. Sobolewski, W. Domcke, C. Dedonder-Lardeux and C. Jouvet, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2002, 4, 1093].
Background	Recent excited state ab initio calculations for H atom photodetachment processes from NH-containing heteroaromatic compounds, aromatic amines, or phenols have suggested a new paradigm for the photochemical dynamics in these systems.1
Method	Accordingly, the fate of the photoexcited molecules is controlled by conical intersections between the usually strongly absorbing first excited 1ππ* state, a neighboring optically dark 1πσ* state, and the S0 electronic ground state.
Method	The key role in the ensuing dynamics is played by the πσ* state which becomes repulsive along the NH or OH stretching coordinates and intersects the S0 state at long NH/OH bond lengths because the latter does not adiabatically correlate with the respective dissociation products in their electronic ground states.
Background	Conical intersections between the ππ* and πσ* and the πσ* and S0 potential energy hypersurfaces thus open efficient pathways for radiationless electronic transitions leading to an ultrafast relaxation of the excited molecules to the electronic ground state and/or to a fast NH/OH bond fission and corresponding dissociation of the molecules.
Background	These mode specific channels have been postulated to have great importance for the photochemical properties of the nucleic acid bases and the biologically relevant aromatic amino acids,2–6 for intramolecular H atom transfer reactions in excited electronic states (ESIHT),7 and for photo-induced intermolecular H atom transfer reactions in hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.6,8–10
Background	The pyrrole molecule is an almost ideal model system for which the photochemical dynamics can be studied in detail.
Background	In addition, it is a building block of many biologically important compounds which may show related mechanisms.1,11
Background	Last but not least, it plays a role in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pesticides, organic polymers, and organometallic magnets.12
Background	The UV absorption spectrum of pyrrole shows two strong bands, the first with an intensity maximum near λ = 210 nm, the second near 165 nm.
Background	In addition, a very weak feature is observed with a maximum around 240 nm.13–16
Background	The spectrum between 190 and 260 nm is reproduced in Fig. 1.
Background	As can be seen, the absorption bands are very broad and unstructured and this has hampered their analysis for a long time.
Method	Further work has been performed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy,15 photoelectron spectroscopy,17–19 and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).20
Method	In addition, the experimental studies were complemented by theoretical electronic structure investigations.15,21–23
Background	The most recent quantum chemical calculations by Roos et al23. showed that the bulk of the intensity of the 210 nm band arises from the intra-valence transition to the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state.
Background	A small contribution (≈15%) may also come from the neighboring 2 1A1 (ππ*) state.
Background	The 165 nm band has been attributed to the excitation to the 1 1B1 and 2 1B2 states which belong to the 3p Rydberg series.
Background	The analysis of the weak 240 nm band has, however, been controversial.
Background	The respective transition has traditionally been assigned to the 1 1A2 (3s) Rydberg state.22,23
Background	The observation of this electronically forbidden band can be explained by a vibronic coupling with the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state induced by out-of-plane vibrations (b1 symmetry).
Background	One earlier paper has also assigned the 240 nm band to the excited 2 1A1 valence state.24
Background	However, Sobolewski and Domcke1,11 recently demonstrated that the stretching of the NH bond in the 1 1A2 state leads to a Rydberg-to-valence transformation by which that bond becomes anti-bonding, i.e., the electron configuration becomes πσ*.
Background	The Rydberg character remains evident by the diffuseness of the σ* orbital, but the πσ* character was postulated to be responsible for a fast mode-specific N–H bond dissociation and, through a conical intersection with the S0 state, for an efficient radiationless relaxation of the electronically excited molecules.
Background	Moreover, a fast predissociation of the ππ* state by the πσ* state was suggested to explain the apparently extremely short lifetimes of the excited states of pyrrole and the resulting absence of observations of laser induced fluorescence.
Background	Direct experimental evidence for these theoretically predicted processes had, however, been missing.
Background	In a recent communication, we reported on first results of an investigation of the formation of H atoms from pyrrole and, for comparison, N-methylpyrrole in their lowest excited electronic states by photofragment velocity map imaging.25
Method	Pyrrole was excited to the 1 1A2 (πσ*) state at λ = 243 nm, and the nascent H atoms were detected at the same wavelength by 2 + 1 REMPI.
Background	The observed H atom velocity maps showed the existence of two dissociation channels.
Background	The first was found to produce very fast H atoms and appeared to be due to a rapid direct NH bond cleavage in the excited electronic state, as predicted by the theoretical studies.1,11
Background	The H atom kinetic energy distribution had a strong, narrow peak at high translational energies.
Background	The less important second channel was observed to lead to much slower H atoms with a very broad kinetic energy distribution, consistent with a statistical formation via unimolecular decay reactions in the electronic ground state after internal conversion from the excited state.
Background	This conclusion was supported by the results for N-methylpyrrole which showed only H atoms corresponding to the second channel.
Background	The experimental results25 thus corroborated the proposal by Sobolewski and Domcke1,11 that the lowest excited electronic state of pyrrole has πσ* character and is anti-bonding with respect to the stretching of the N–H bond.
Problem	In this discussion paper, we present the results of an extended study of the photochemical dynamics of normal pyrrole (pyrrole-h1) and selectively deuterated pyrrole (pyrrole-d1) at two excitation wavelengths, λ = 243 nm and λ = 217 nm.
Method	The reactions studied can be written as C4H4NH + hν → H + C4H4NandC4H4ND + hν → D + C4H4N → H + C4H3NDThe two excitation wavelengths (243 and 217 nm) will be indicated below by unprimed and primed labels, where appropriate.
Method	In the first set of experiments (λ = 243 nm, one colour), we probed the H and D atom photodetachment from both isotopomers via the 1 1A2 (πσ*) state.
Result	The obtained new D atom images from pyrrole-d1 (reaction (2d)) were seen to exhibit an efficient ultrafast mode-specific dissociation of the ND bond of the molecules on the πσ* potential energy surface, confirming the corresponding interpretation of our earlier experiments25 and providing direct evidence for the theoretical predictions of Sobolewski and Domcke.1,11
Method	In the second set of experiments, we performed two-colour measurements, in which the molecules were excited to the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state at λ = 217 nm and the H atoms were again probed at λ = 243 nm.
Conclusion	The results of these experiments corroborate the postulate that the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state is predissociated by the repulsive πσ* state.
Background	The photofragment velocity map imaging apparatus built in our laboratory will be described in some detail elsewhere.26
Background	The basic set-up resembles that of Eppink and Parker.27
Method	A gas mixture containing ≈0.1% of pyrrole in He was prepared by bubbling the seed gas through a sample of liquid pyrrole stored in a glass reservoir at –20 °C and 1 bar pressure.
Method	The gases expanded into a differentially pumped stainless steel vacuum chamber through a solenoid actuated pulsed valve (General Valve #9) operated at 10 Hz repetition rate with ≈350 µs pulse–1 opening times.
Method	A molecular beam entered the second vacuum stage through a 1 mm diameter electroformed conical skimmer (Beam Dynamics).
Result	Based on our experience with other molecules under similar expansion conditions,28 the rotational temperature of the pyrrole in the molecular beam was estimated to be of the order of Trot ≈ (20 ± 10) K.
Method	The photolysis/probe laser beams intersected the molecular beam at right angle halfway between the repeller and extractor plates of the Wiley-McLaren ion imaging electrode assembly.
Method	A liquid nitrogen cryo-pump surrounding the arrangement minimized the residual hydrocarbon background.
Method	The laser radiation at λ = 243 nm (≈0.05–1.4 mJ) was generated by frequency-doubling the output of a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-3/Lambda Physik FL-3002) in a BBO I crystal and focused into the molecular beam with an f = 1 m lens.
Method	Light at λ = 217 nm (≈0.1–2.0 mJ) was generated by frequency-doubling the output of a XeCl excimer pumped dye laser (Lambda Physik EMG 201/Lambda Physik FL-3002) in a BBO II crystal.
Method	To avoid a photolysis of the pyrrole with the λ = 243 nm probe light in the two-colour experiments, the probe power was lowered until the 243 nm one-colour signal in the absence of the 217 nm photolysis beam had virtually disappeared.
Method	The probe beam was time-delayed by ≈15 ns with respect to the counterpropagating photolysis beam.
Method	The laser polarizations were oriented with the electric field vectors perpendicular to the plane defined by the molecular beam and the laser beams using Wollaston polarizers and Fresnel double rhombs.
Method	All imaging measurements were made under velocity mapping conditions.27
Method	The probe laser was periodically scanned by ±6 cm–1 resp. ±4 cm–1 around the line centers of the recoiling H and D atoms to cover their complete Doppler profiles.
Method	The resulting H+/D+ ions were detected by a microchannel plate (MCP) detector coupled to a phosphorescence screen.
Method	The obtained signals were recorded with a CCD camera (640 × 480 pixels, LaVision) and accumulated over up to 200 000 laser shots using single ion counting and centroiding29 to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution and discriminate against noise.
Method	Background images were taken under the same experimental conditions with the molecular beam valve closed.
Method	Mass selectivity was achieved using a fast transistor switch (Behlke) to gate the MCP voltage.
Method	Normal pyrrole (Aldrich, 98%) was used after repeated fractionated distillation until the liquid was clear.
Method	Catalytic reactions in the stainless steel supply pipe were suppressed by maintaining a slow flow of the pyrrole/carrier gas mixture through a 1 mm id teflon tube extending in the supply line from the sample reservoir all the way to the molecular beam nozzle.
Method	Pyrrole-d1 was prepared from the normal isotopomer by repeated stirring with excess D2O.
Method	The final product was dried over Na2CO3.
Method	The deuteration (>97%) was checked by NMR spectroscopy.
Method	The gas supply lines of the apparatus were thoroughly purged overnight with D2O vapour before the measurements with the deuterated sample to prevent isotope exchange with H2O at the walls.
Method	The two-dimensional (2D) velocity mapped H/D images provided by the experiments at λ = 243 nm and λ = 217 nm were inverse Abel transformed30 to obtain the respective three-dimensional (3D) velocity distributions using the basis-set expansion method of Dribinski et al.31
Method	The required calibrations were performed by measuring H/D photofragment images from HBr/DBr and HI/DI, for which the dissociation energies are precisely known (D00(HBr) = 30 210 cm–1, D00(HI) = 24 630 cm–1).32–35
Background	The results obtained at the two excitation wavelengths will be considered separately.
Result	The H atom image from pyrrole-h1 and the D and H atom images from pyrrole-d1 recorded in the one-colour photodissociation experiments at λ = 243 nm are displayed in Fig. 2a–c in the upper row.
Result	The respective 3D velocity distributions are given in the second row.
Result	All images show a clearly visible, spatially anisotropic outer ring corresponding to very fast H/D atoms with a sharply peaked speed distribution and a diffuse, spatially isotropic inner region reflecting slower H/D atoms with a broad speed distribution.
Background	With the data for the deuterated molecule, these distinctive dissociation channels can be identified with some confidence.
Background	Reiterating first the conclusions for the case of pyrrole-h1 (reaction (1), Fig. 2a),25 the fast H atoms can be attributed to the direct NH dissociation in the πσ* state (referred to in our earlier paper and in the following as channel A) and the slower H atoms may be ascribed to unimolecular decay reactions after internal conversion (IC) to the S0 state (referred to as channel B).
Background	However, the evidence for the assignment of the fast H atoms to the NH group had so far only been circumstantial.25
Result	The present results provide the missing additional information: In particular, it can be seen from the image for reaction (2d) in Fig. 2b that the sharp ring of fast D atoms from pyrrole-d1, for which the site of the D atom is unambiguous, is even more striking than that of the H atoms from pyrrole-h1 (Fig. 2a).
Result	At the same time, the slow D atom signal from pyrrole-d1 is the by far weakest in the series.
Conclusion	These results demonstrate clearly that the fast D atoms originate from the N position and not from any of the four C positions of the parent molecule.
Result	In contrast, pyrrole-d1 shows the highest intensity of slow H atoms in the series of the three molecules (Fig. 2c, channel B), although there is also a small fraction of fast H atoms from pyrrole-d1.
Problem	The latter observation may indicate the existence of a third pathway (referred to in the following as channel C, see discussion).
Method	The relative yields of D and H from pyrrole-d1 were determined by recording a REMPI spectrum (Fig. 3).
Result	From the ratio of the integrated signals, the ND group accounts for ≈(74 ± 5)% of the observed atoms, while the four CH sites account for ≈(26 ± 5)%.
Conclusion	On a per bond basis, CH dissociation is therefore really only a minor process.
Background	In the following, the attention will be focused mainly on the direct dissociation dynamics via channel A.
Result	The total center-of-mass (cm) translational energy distributions P(ET) of the photofragments which follow by integrating the 3D velocity distributions (Fig. 2) over the angular directions and applying linear momentum conservation for the two fragments are given in Fig. 4a–c.
Method	The areas under the experimental curves in the three panels were normalized with respect to each other to reflect the respective branching ratios.
Result	The clearly bimodal distributions nicely confirm the existence of the aforementioned distinctive dissociation channels that were apparent from the images.
Method	In order to determine quantitative data for a comparison of the three isotopomers and their dynamics at the two photoexcitation wavelengths, the P(ET) profiles were fitted by using a sharply peaked Gaussian to represent the contributions of the fast atoms and a simple polynomial to account for the broad background of slow atoms.
Result	As seen, the experimental profiles could be nicely described.
Method	Alternatively, the fast atoms were also modeled using a three-parameter trial function of the form36P(ET) = Eavl[faT(1 – fT)b],where fT is the fraction of the available excess energy (Eavl) channeled into fragment translation.
Background	This flexible fitting function has the advantage that Eavl, which is given by the photon energy minus the dissociation energy of the molecules, can be determined by the fitting.
Result	Apart from this point, however, the differences between using this expression or the Gaussian were negligible.
Result	The parameters from the fits are compiled in Table 1.
Result	In addition, the table lists the relative yields (branching ratios) yi of the different dissociation channels given by the areas under the respective curves.
Result	For reaction (2), the yi values account for the branching ratio between (2d) and (2h) from Fig. 3 so that the total yield is ∑i yi = 1.
Method	The energy balance for the dissociation according to channel A is given by Ehν = D00 + ET + EPyVR – EPVR.Ehν is the photon energy, D00 the NH/ND bond dissociation energy, ET the total translational energy of the two fragments, EPyVR the vibration–rotation energy of the pyrrolyl co-product, and EPVR the internal energy of the parent molecules.
Method	Considering the efficient cooling of the molecules in the molecular beam expansion, the latter term is small and may be neglected.
Method	Thus, the available energy partitioned among the translational and internal (vibration–rotation) degrees of freedom of the fragments is Eavl = Ehν – D00 = ET + EPyVR.Since the fastest H/D atoms may be assumed to correspond to internally cold pyrrolyl radicals (EPyVR ≈ 0), Eavl can be determined from the sharp cut-off of the P(ET) distribution at the allowed maximal value (EmaxT) of ET , eqn. (I).
Result	The data are given in Table 1.
Result	The corresponding values for the bond dissociation energy according to eqn. (III) are
Result	D00(NH) = (31 000 ± 500) cm–1,
Result	D00(ND) = (31 500 ± 500) cm–1.
Result	Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 1 that on average about 67% of the available energy is channeled into relative fragment translation, 33% is deposited as internal energy in the pyrrolyl radical.
Method	The photofragment angular distributions P(θ) are obtained in principle by integrating the 3D velocity maps in Fig. 2 over the radii.
Method	The resulting distributions can then be fitted using the standard expression37P(θ) = (4π)–1[1 + βP2(cos θ)].θ is the angle between the recoil direction and the laser polarization, P2(cos θ) is the second-order Legendre polynomial, and β is the anisotropy parameter.
Background	In the limiting case of a single dissociation channel resulting from a pure parallel or perpendicular electronic transition, β is known to take the values +2 or –1, respectively, as long as the dissociation is fast compared to the rotation of the molecules.
Background	In the present case, we have an anisotropic (βA < 0) distribution (channel A) above an isotropic (βB = 0) background (channel B).
Method	In order to separate both contributions as well as possible, we integrated the 3D velocity maps by considering only the anisotropic outer shells with ET in the range 5000 cm–1 ≤ ET ≤ 8000 cm–1.
Result	The resulting P(θ) distributions from reactions (1) and (2d) are presented in Fig. 5.
Result	The values for the effective asymmetry parameters (βeff) which were fitted to these data are given in Table 1.
Result	The anisotropy parameters for channel A (βA) listed in Table 1 in the last column were then found by correcting βeff for the relative fractions of the two channels in the integration range.
Result	The data confirm the assumption of a preferentially perpendicular distribution.
Result	The H/D velocity maps obtained after excitation of the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state at λ = 217 nm in the two-colour experiments and the resulting 3D velocity distributions are depicted in Fig. 6a–c.
Result	In principle, the images look similar to those seen before at λ = 243 nm.
Result	In particular, they exhibit again a sharp, anisotropic outer ring reflecting fast H/D atoms with a narrow speed distribution and a broad, structureless inner feature corresponding to much slower atoms.
Result	The sharp rings in the H atom image from reaction (1′) in Fig. 6a and the D atom image from reaction (2d′) in Fig. 6b are again attributed to a fast dissociation of the NH/ND bond (referred to in the following as channel A′).
Conclusion	Since the excited 1 1B2 (ππ*) state does not correlate directly with H/D + pyrrolyl, this dissociation is assumed to proceed via the lower-lying πσ* state, in accordance with the theoretical predictions.1,11
Result	The structureless inner signal is again ascribed to unimolecular decay processes in the S0 state (channel B′).
Result	In addition, pyrrole-d1 also leads to H atoms (Fig. 6c, channels B′ and C′).
Result	A REMPI scan (Fig. 7) gave relative yields of ≈(40 ± 5)% D and ≈(60 ± 5)% H (see discussion).
Result	The total translational energy distributions P(ET) at λ = 217 nm are given in Fig. 8.
Result	The data were fitted in the same way as above; the results are collected in Table 2.
Result	Considered on a per bond basis, the direct fission of the NH/ND bond (channel A′) can be seen to remain a major dissociation pathway.
Result	However, compared to the results at λ = 243 nm, the data at λ = 217 nm show significantly higher yields for channel B′.
Result	In line with the higher photon energy, the P(ET) distributions for both channels A′ and B′ extend to higher translational energies (i.e., higher EmaxT).
Result	At the same time, the distributions are significantly broader.
Result	However, the cut-off of channel A′ at EmaxT is not as well defined at λ = 217 nm than at 243 nm.
Result	Indeed, the increase of the apparent EmaxT is smaller than the increase in the photon energies (ΔEhν = 4900 cm–1).
Result	Furthermore, the distributions at the two wavelengths reach their peaks at practically the same energies (EpeakT).
Result	These findings are reflected by a correspondingly smaller fraction of the available energy funneled into fragment translation (43% at λ = 217 nm compared to 67% at λ = 243 nm).
Conclusion	Thus, in summary, a higher fraction of the excess energy appears to be deposited in internal degrees of freedom of the pyrrolyl radical.
Result	Despite the greater contributions of channel B′, the images at 217 nm show stronger spatial anisotropy than those at 243 nm.
Result	The angular distributions P(θ) from reactions (1′) and (2d′) are presented in Fig. 9.
Result	The effective asymmetry parameters βeff and the resulting βA′ values are listed in Table 2.
Result	The average value of βA′ = –0.95 ± 0.05 is practically equal to the perpendicular limit of β = –1.
Background	The photodissociation of pyrrole has first been studied by Blank et al. using photofragment translational spectroscopy (PTS).38
Background	The authors performed experiments at two fixed wavelengths, λ = 248 nm and 193 nm.
Conclusion	The reported results for the formation of H atoms at both wavelengths are comparable to those obtained in the present work, although the underlying mechanisms could not be elucidated in detail at the time because of the lack of information on the excited electronic states of pyrrole.
Background	However, the PTS results are of interest for this discussion because of the information on the branching ratios of the ensuing channels.
Background	At λ = 248 nm, H + pyrrolyl were the only observed products.
Background	At 193 nm, the authors also observed substantial amounts (≈50%) of products from ring opening reactions.
Result	The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate clearly that the photochemical mechanisms of pyrrole in the near UV can only be rationalized by strong interactions between two excited electronic states in the region, 1 1A2 and 1 1B2, and the electronic ground state S0.
Result	The excited states have πσ* and ππ* character, respectively.
Result	The electronic absorption is dominated by the oscillator strength of the 1 1B2 state (f = 0.209).23
Result	The dipole moment for the excitation from S0 lies in the molecular plane and perpendicular to the NH bond.
Result	The 2 1A1 (ππ*) state, which has been calculated only 0.14 eV below 1 1B2, also plays some role (f = 0.036).
Result	In contrast, the calculated oscillator strength of the 1 1A2 state is negligible.
Result	As mentioned, the 1 1A2 state is observed in the UV spectrum only very weakly as a result of vibronic coupling with the neighboring electronically allowed states.
Result	A schematic diagram of the 1 1A2 (πσ*) and 1 1B2 (ππ*) potential energy surfaces is depicted in Fig. 10.
Background	The energy profiles were plotted according to the information given by Sobolewski and Domcke.1,11
Result	Note that the S0 electronic state itself does not correlate directly with H + pyrrolyl in their electronic ground states.
Background	The previously reported H atom velocity maps from the photodissociation of pyrrole and N-methylpyrrole at λ = 243 nm gave the first experimental evidence for the repulsive nature of the 1 1A2 excited electronic state of pyrrole with respect to the NH bond.25
Background	The experimental observation of very fast H atoms with a narrow and spatially anisotropic velocity distribution (channel A) from pyrrole, but not from N-methylpyrrole, was consistent with the theoretical predictions1,11 that, as shown in Fig. 10, the NH bond in the first electronic state of pyrrole acquires πσ* character as the bond is stretched.
Conclusion	With the detection of very fast D atoms from the photodissociation of pyrrole-d1 with a similar narrow and spatially anisotropic velocity distribution, the present work provides unambiguous evidence for the proposed mechanism.
Result	Indeed, the fast direct ND bond fission in pyrrole- d1 in the 1 1A2 (πσ*) excited electronic state accounts for 90% of the observed D atoms, or, when the H atoms from dissociation of the CH positions are taken into account, 67% of all channels.
Background	The branching ratio for the direct H detachment in the excited state measured by Blank et al38. is somewhat smaller (47%) than ours (67%).
Result	However, at λ = 248 nm, the molecules are excited just to the electronic origin of the 1 1A2 state.
Conclusion	The difference of the branching ratios at 248 and 243 nm can thus be explained by a trapping of the molecules with the lower excitation energy in the shallow potential energy well of the 1 1A2 state that has been found in the ab initio calculations.1,11
Result	The shapes of the translational energy distributions of the fast H/D atoms in the present work and the study by Blank et al. are similar (see Table 1).
Result	The mode-specific nature of the fast NH/ND dissociation process in the 1 1A2 state can be attributed to the unusual properties of the potential energy surface of the state (Fig. 10).
Result	In particular, the large potential energy gradient along the NH stretching coordinate (πσ*) provides a strong driving force for a fast, direct cleavage of the NH/ND bond.
Result	The conical intersection between the 1 1A2 and S0 states at rNH ≈ 1.85 Å then acts as a funnel, through which the H/D atoms are expelled with very high kinetic energies.
Result	This occurs on a time scale before IC to S0 and intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) may compete.
Conclusion	From the spatial anisotropy parameter (β ≈ –0.45, Table 1), we have to conclude in any case that the dissociation lifetime of the excited molecules is comparable to or even shorter than their rotational period.
Result	The electronic excitation is seen to be preferentially perpendicular, as we would expect for a vibronic coupling of the 1 1A2 to the 1 1B2 state.
Problem	However, there may also be contribution from vibronic coupling to the 2 1A1 state, which can be reached from S0via a parallel transition.
Conclusion	Thus, the β value could arise from a mixture of the two states.
Result	In the limiting case of a very fast dissociation with β1 = –1 for the perpendicular (1 1B2) and β2 = +2 for the parallel (2 1A1) branch, this would imply a ratio of 82∶18% for the two states.
Background	Incidentally, this is close to the ratio of the oscillator strengths.
Background	Obviously, some caution with these considerations is advisable because of a possible short trapping of the molecules in the 1 1A2 state.
Result	We note nevertheless that in the case of the direct excitation of the 1 1B2 state at λ = 217 nm, we have β = –0.95 ± 0.05 (Table 2), practically equal to the perpendicular limit, even though in this case the excited molecules have to pass through another conical intersection (from 1 1B2 to the πσ* state) before the subsequent dissociation on the πσ* potential surface.
Result	Considering the data for pyrrole-d1 (reaction (2)), a fraction of 33% of the H/D atoms appears to be produced via different other mechanisms.
Problem	IC from the 1 1A2 to the S0 electronic state is the first process that comes to mind.
Background	This radiationless electronic transition is likely mediated by the same conical intersection that is responsible for the fast NH/ND bond dissociation (cf. Fig. 10).1,11
Background	The intersection arises due to a vibrational mode of a2 symmetry, which corresponds to a screwing of the aromatic ring.
Background	H/D atoms can then be produced from the resulting vibrationally hot S0 molecules via a variety of unimolecular decay processes (channel B).
Method	The unimolecular dissociation of pyrrole in the electronic ground state has been studied experimentally by shock tube pyrolysis measurements39,40 and theoretically by quantum chemical techniques and chemical kinetic modeling.40–44
Background	The major decomposition products were found to be HCN, methylacetylene, and acetylene, besides numerous other products appearing in smaller quantities.
Background	The complete mechanism that has been developed includes ≈200 elementary reactions so that a detailed discussion exceeds the scope of the present paper.
Background	The lowest energy dissociation channel was found to proceed via an H atom migration to pyrrolenine (2H-pyrrole) followed by decomposition to HCN and CH3CCH.39,40,43,44
Result	From the measurements of Blank et al38. who probed the molecules at almost the same excitation energy (λ = 248 nm), we know that these products do not seem play a role here.
Problem	There is also a possibility for an isomerization to cis-crotonitrile or vinylacetonitrile.
Background	H + pyrrolyl are formed preferentially by the dissociation of the CH2 group in the pyrrolenine intermediate rather than by direct NH bond fission.43
Background	In this case, between one third and one half of the H atoms should originate from the NH position, the other two thirds to one half should originate from the CH positions, in line with the experimental results for reaction (2).
Background	In addition, there are several other pathways to H atoms, including some that are connected with ring opening processes.
Background	These atoms are expected to be produced with, essentially, statistical translational energy distributions.
Background	Since the complex sequential unimolecular reactions of the molecules in the S0 state are not the main topic at this Discussion on non-adiabatic effects, we will not consider them in further detail.
Result	Surprisingly, the photodissociation of pyrrole-d1 also seems to produce a small amount (≈10%) of fast H atoms (referred to above as channel C) with a similar velocity distribution as the D atoms from channel A (Table 1).
Result	While it is difficult to rule out an experimental artifact by a D/H exchange in the molecules in the gas supply line between the reservoir and the molecular beam valve, it is noted that the results were reproducible from day to day and did not seem to depend on the length of time the system was treated with D2O.
Background	A similar channel has also been noted by Blank et al.38
Conclusion	Thus, we are tempted to postulate either a small contribution from a direct dissociation of one of the CH bonds in the excited 1 1A2 state or a fast partial intramolecular exchange in the excited state before the NH dissociation on the repulsive 1 1A2 potential energy surface.
Background	Both processes should be investigated by additional theoretical calculations.
Background	However, a fast D/H isotope exchange would also explain the observations.
Background	The NH bond dissociation energy of the pyrrole molecule is of fundamental importance for estimating the thermal stability of the molecule in combustion processes.
Background	The present study can be considered as the most direct experimental determination to date.
Result	The value of D00(NH) = (31 000 ± 500) cm–1 is in excellent agreement with that given by Blank et al.38
Result	(D00 = 30 800 cm–1) and slightly lower that the ab initio quantum chemical estimate of 33 180 cm–1 reported by Bacskay et al.42
Background	The discrepancy to our earlier report25 stems from the recalibration of the velocity map images based on the photodissociation HBr and HI.
Result	The difference between the values of D00(NH) and D00(ND) is somewhat smaller than the expected isotope effect and not unreasonable considering the error limits.
Background	The accuracy of the present data is limited essentially only by the resolution of the images.
Result	The experimental results after excitation of the 1 1B2 (ππ*) state at λ = 217 nm show that a large fraction of the excited molecules decay again by a fast detachment of the H atom from the NH position, although the excited state is bound with respect to the NH coordinate (Fig. 10).
Result	As shown in Fig. 10, the geometry-optimized 1 1B2 (ππ*) state lies slightly above the optimized 1 1A2 (πσ*) state.
Background	In a multi-dimensional picture, both are connected by a surface of intersection.
Background	Vibrational modes of b1 symmetry lift the degeneracies and lead to a conical intersection that can promote an efficient ultrafast radiationless transition from the 1 1B2 to the 1 1A2 surface.11,1
Background	The subsequent dynamics is thus controlled by the πσ* potential surface.
Background	In particular, the πσ* nature of the state leads to the same ultrafast NH bond dissociation and formation of H + pyrrolyl as observed before at λ = 243 nm.
Conclusion	Thus the experimental results for the observed channel A′ can be rationalized by a fast predissociation of the 1 1B2.
Conclusion	From the anisotropy parameter of β = –0.95, we have to conclude that this occurs on an ultrafast timescale (τ ≲ 300 fs).
Result	The translational energy distributions resulting from the predissociation of the 1 1B2 state at λ = 217 nm are remarkably similar to those observed from the 1 1A2 state at λ = 243 nm.
Result	In particular, the peak energies (EpeakT) are practically identical, despite of the higher photon energy at 217 nm, which increases Eavl by ≈4900 cm–1.
Background	This picture is extended by the results at λ = 193 nm,38 where the addition of another 5700 cm–1 to Eavl raises EpeakT by just a few hundred cm–1.
Result	The only effect of the increase of Eavl at the higher photon energies is a slight increase of the widths of the P(ET) distributions.
Conclusion	As suggested by Fig. 10, only the NH stretching vibration can lead to a high translational energy release.
Conclusion	Obviously, the extra energy cannot be released as translational energy and remains in the pyrrolyl radical as internal energy.
Conclusion	The almost identical EpeakT values at the different excitation wavelengths thus show that the coupling between the reaction coordinate (NH stretching motion) and the other nuclear coordinates during the fast decay on the 1 1A2 surface is almost negligible.
Conclusion	The geometries of the molecule at the conical intersection between the 1 1B2 and the 1 1A2 state are suggested to be very different compared to the equilibrium configuration.
Result	As in the experiments at λ = 243 nm, the formation of the slow H/D atoms with a broad translational energy distribution (channel B′) is attributed to an electronic relaxation to the S0 state followed by unimolecular dissociation.
Result	A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows that this pathway is more important at λ = 217 nm than at 243 nm.
Result	The higher fraction of channel B′ can be rationalized by two decay processes, direct relaxation from the 1 1B2 to the S0 state and relaxation via the 1 1A2 state.
Result	The additional internal energy from the higher photon energy may be responsible for the more efficient relaxation to S0.
Result	It also leads to a faster unimolecular decomposition of the S0 state.
Background	Products from ring opening reactions have not been detected in the present work.
Background	At λ = 193 nm, however, Blank et al. observed ≈50% of HCN + C3H4.38
Result	In addition, there is again a small fraction of fast H atoms from the photodissociation of pyrrole-d1 (see above).
Problem	The photodissociation of pyrrole in the 1 1A2 (πσ*) first excited electronic state at λ = 243 nm and in the higher lying 1 1B2 (ππ*) electronic state at λ = 217 nm has been studied by photofragment velocity map imaging.
Result	The results show that the dynamics differ strikingly from the unimolecular decomposition of the molecules in the electronic ground state.
Result	The 1 1A2 state decays mainly via fast mode-specific NH bond fission, which is driven by the repulsive nature of the πσ* potential energy surface along the NH stretching coordinate.
Result	The H atoms are therefore eliminated with very high kinetic energy close to the maximum available energy.
Result	In addition, the 1 1A2 state can undergo a fast IC to the electronic ground state followed by unimolecular decay of the vibrationally highly excited S0 molecules.
Result	The 1 1B2 state is predissociated by the πσ* state.
Result	Thus, it exhibits the same fast mode-specific NH bond fission channel.
Result	However, IC to S0 and subsequent unimolecular decomposition plays a larger role.
Result	The highly efficient radiationless electronic transitions from the ππ* to the πσ* state and from the πσ* to the S0 state are mediated by conical intersections between the respective potential energy surfaces.
Result	From the strongly anisotropic angular H atom distributions, the lifetimes of the excited electronic states are short compared to the rotational period of the molecules.
Result	Minor additional pathways which need further investigation may be a direct CH dissociation and/or a fast exchange between the NH and CH positions in the excited electronic state(s).
Conclusion	The radiationless decay mechanisms established in the present work for pyrrole are of substantial interest for the ongoing discussion of the photochemical dynamics of the nucleic acid bases.
Background	In particlar, the purine bases are known to show a low-lying threshold, above which the excited states are abruptly quenched.2–6
Background	It is currently a matter of controversy whether this quenching is due to a ππ*–nπ* coupling2,3 or to the suggested ultrafast NH/OH predissociation via the πσ* mechanism.1
Background	The πσ* mechanism may also play a role in excited state intramolecular hydrogen transfer (ESIHT) processes.7
Background	Furthermore, it has even been proposed to lead a fast NC bond fission in electronically excited N-methylpyrrole45.

Problem	The low energy tautomers and conformers of the dipeptides HisGly and GlyHis and of their sodium ion complexes in the gas phase
Problem	The low-lying conformers of the dipeptides HisGly and GlyHis, and of their sodium cation complexes, have been studied with a combination of Monte Carlo search with the Amber force field and local geometry optimization at the ab initio HF/6-31G(d) level, completed with MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p) energetics at the HF/6-31G(d) geometries.
Method	For each dipeptide, both the Nδ–H and Nε–H tautomers of the imidazole side chain of His were considered.
Method	For each of the four isomeric dipeptides, 20–30 conformers were fully characterized at the ab initio level.
Result	All low energy structures are found to involve H-bonding at the Nδ position of imidazole, either as a N–H donor or a N acceptor, depending upon the tautomer.
Result	In three out of the four species, the most stable conformer involves a C-terminus carboxylic acid in its less favorable trans conformation, in order to maximize intramolecular H bonding.
Result	It turns out that the lowest energy tautomer of HisGly is Nε–H, while that of GlyHis is Nδ–H.
Conclusion	This result argues in favor of the diversity of His tautomeric states in peptides and proteins.
Problem	The sodium cation complexes of both GlyHis and HisGly have been studied as well, again considering both tautomers in each case.
Result	In three out of the four species, the most stable structure involves chelation of sodium by the two carbonyl oxygens and the imidazole ring.
Result	On the contrary, the sodium complex of the Nδ–H tautomer of HisGly favors chelation to the peptidic carbonyl oxygen, the imidazole ring and the amino terminus.
Result	In the Nε–H tautomers of both peptides, the most favorable binding site of imidazole is the Nδ nitrogen, while in the Nδ–H tautomers, it is the π cloud which provides side chain interaction.
Conclusion	As a result, both GlyHisNa+ and HisGlyNa+ favor the Nε–H tautomer of His, in contrast to what was found for the free peptides.
Background	Among all naturally occurring α-amino acids in living systems, histidine (His) occupies a special position.
Background	The side chain of His, methylene-imidazole, bears two nitrogen atoms with variable protonation states.
Background	Their pK’s are such that imidazole may easily exchange protons with its surroundings in the biologically significant range of pH, effectively supporting many chemical reactions.
Background	Because of this versatility, histidine has been found to be involved in ca. 50% of the active sites of all enzymes, in a recent analysis of the enzyme structural database.1
Background	The Lewis basicity of His also makes it a common ligand in the first metal coordination sphere of metallo-proteins.
Background	It is even considered that coordinated His may exist in its fully deprotonated form, at least as a transient species.2
Background	Therefore, the protonation state of His in peptides and proteins is a matter of great interest.
Background	In the pH range 6.3–9.0 in aqueous solution at room temperature, isolated His exists as a zwitterion with a non-protonated side chain imidazole.
Background	In this and higher pH range, the imidazole is in either of two tautomeric forms, Nδ–H and Nε–H.
Background	Scheme 1 shows the two Nδ–H and Nε–H tautomers in the non-zwitterionic form.
Background	Protonation of either form at the imino nitrogen leads to an imidazolium ion from which proton release may occur from either of the two nitrogens, leading to each of the two tautomers.
Background	In His-containing peptides and proteins, it is therefore expected that the occurrence of the two tautomers is strongly influenced by the presence of H bond donors and acceptors in the surroundings, and by the chemical reactions which occur.
Method	Determining the tautomer populations in proteins usually relies on NMR measurements.
Method	One-dimensional measurements on various nuclei suffer from various drawbacks, although 15N spectra have been shown to yield unambiguous information on His tautomers in 15N-enriched proteins, and in isolated His at various pH and temperatures, in several solvents.3
Method	More recently, several techniques have been devised to identify the protonation state and tautomeric forms of His, including N–C J couplings1,4 and 2D 1H/13Cδ correlations.5
Background	It remains the case, however, that the protonation and tautomeric states of most His residues in most crystallographic structures in protein databases are not unequivocally assigned.
Method	In such cases, hydrogen locations are assigned, either in the structure determination and refinement procedure, or in post-structural analysis, using tools whose reliability is not known in general.
Method	A recent computational and statistical study6 has indeed issued a warning signal about the significance of proton positions in His residues in protein databases, whenever specific NMR data is not available.
Background	This study, based on local energy minimization of His side chain torsions using the Amber force field, showed that proton assignments appear to be no better than random.
Background	Thus it is currently difficult to extract from structural databases whether there is a strong preference for one of the tautomers of His in proteins, even with the restriction to the interior of proteins, where the solvent is not expected to have a strong influence.
Background	One result of the computational study is that there appears to be no general preference for one tautomer over the other.
Background	In order to understand in details the factors determining the relative stabilities of His tautomers, it is therefore of interest to study model systems.
Background	The situation is simple in isolated His, for which 15N NMR, as well as other techniques, have established that the Nε–H tautomer is largely dominant.3
Background	This dominance has been discussed in terms of the intramolecular hydrogen bond which may establish between the Nδ and one or two of the N–H bond(s) of the ammonium group (note that in the following, we use the notation Nδ and Nε, with δ and ε as subscripts, for the imidazole nitrogen atom at the δ and ε position, respectively, so that Nδ–H and Nε–H denote the nitrogen–hydrogen bonds at these positions.
Background	On the other hand, Nδ–H and Nε–H, with δ and ε as superscripts, are used to describe the tautomers with the N–H bond at the δ and ε position, respectively).
Background	The same type of argument was found to explain the structure of the dipeptide HisGly, for which several crystal structures have been determined.7
Background	In the crystals of both the chloride7a and dichloride7b salts of HisGly (with one and two chloride ions, and singly and doubly protonated HisGly, respectively), there appears to be a strong hydrogen bond between the ammonium group and the imine Nδ of imidazole.
Background	The crystal structure of the hemihydrate of HisGly has also been obtained,7c in which the His side chain is not protonated; the structural parameters are consistent with the existence of a zwitterion, involving a N-terminus ammonium and a C-terminus carboxylate.
Background	Rather surprisingly, it was found that the crystal structure contains two peptide molecules per asymmetric crystal unit, in the two different tautomeric forms.
Background	One is the expected Nε–H tautomer while the second is the Nδ–H tautomer, involving H-bonding between Nδ–H and the C terminal carboxylate.
Background	Thus it appears that HisGly is a simple model in which the coexistence and possible competition between the two tautomers of His already exist.
Problem	For this reason, we have explored the conformational landscape of HisGly.
Problem	In order to delineate in detail the interactions which influence the relative stabilities of the tautomers, we have also studied its dipeptide isomer GlyHis, for which there is no structural information available, to the best of our knowledge.
Method	Clearly such simple models lack the side chain–side chain interactions in which His imidazoles are often involved in proteins.
Method	Yet local interactions within small dipeptides are found to have a significant influence on the relative stabilities of the tautomers.
Problem	We have also studied the sodium cation complexes of HisGly and GlyHis, since in a recent study of the Na+ complexes of a series of small peptides, we found that there exists a significant sequence effect on the binding affinities of HisGly and GlyHis to Na+.8
Background	Sodium is known to bind peptides mostly through their oxygen atoms, however, in GlyHis and HisGly, it is expected that the imidazole side chain can provide an additional binding site, in a way which will depend significantly upon the tautomer.
Background	In the present context, it is interesting to see if cation attachment may be a way to differentiate tautomers.
Background	The detailed understanding of the conformation landscape of small biomolecules is a challenging task, both because there is generally a large to very large number of low-lying energy minima, and because energy barriers connecting these minima are often small, leading to several conformers being populated at room temperature.
Method	Various experimental methods are capable of yielding some structural data on such molecules, yet it remains very difficult to identify the lowest energy conformers with certainty, and to obtain an overview of the potential energy surface.
Method	Quantum chemistry is an efficient alternative to experimental methods to explore the conformations of flexible molecules of relatively small size, as it provides relative energies of conformers with good accuracy, and enables a thorough exploration of the potential energy surface.
Background	There has been ample work on the conformations of Gly in the 1990’s,9 and other amino acids have also been studied, including alanine,10 serine, cysteine,11 valine,12 proline,13 glutamic acid14 and arginine.15
Background	Several oligopeptides have also been studied.16
Problem	Herein we use ab initio computations to establish the structures of the low energy conformations of the dipeptides GlyHis and HisGly in each of their possible tautomeric forms.
Problem	Analogous work has also been carried out for the sodium cation complexes of the four isomers.
Method	The number of weakly hindered rotors (seven covalent single bonds between non-hydrogen atoms) is large enough in GlyHis and HisGly that constructing structures based on chemical intuition solely is not appropriate.
Method	Thus we resorted to a non local exploration of the potential energy surface, as a preliminary step prior to local geometry optimization with the ab initio methods mentioned below.
Method	Monte Carlo sampling was carried out with the Metropolis criterion at 300 K, in which random values were generated for the torsion angles around all single bonds between non-hydrogen atoms except the peptide bond.
Method	In order to keep this procedure computationally tractable, the Amber 94 force field was used for energy calculations, with RESP atomic charges.17
Method	At least two independent searches were performed for each case.
Method	A limit of 1000 random tries or 500 geometry optimizations was set for each search.
Method	The first search was started from a β-strand like extended structure, while the second was started from the lowest energy structure found in the first, ensuring that the two would be largely different.
Method	Random sampling was systematically followed by local geometry optimization at the same level.
Result	However the Amber calculations lead to an energy ordering of conformers which deviates significantly from that obtained with accurate ab initio calculations.
Problem	In order to locate all of the low lying structures, a large sample was selected from the Amber results and subjected to geometry re-optimization at the ab initio level, typically between 20 and 30 in each case (each tautomeric form of GlyHis and HisGly).
Method	In one case, the Nε–H tautomer of HisGly, we first searched the potential energy surface without a Monte Carlo search, but rather with a combination of scanning the relevant torsion angles and selecting structures on the basis of maximizing hydrogen bond interaction.
Method	Then we carried out an MC search starting from one of the low energy structures previously found.
Result	This led structures of ranks 5, 10 and 1 at the optimized Amber level to insert into those previously obtained, and become structures of ranks 2, 6 and 18, respectively, after ab initio re-optimization and final energy calculations.
Method	Yet this procedure is too lengthy to be used in general, therefore we resorted to initial MC searches for all three other cases.
Result	In all cases, the lowest 15 structures at the ab initio level arose from structures in the lower half of the Amber set, which contained from 30 to 40 unique structures, depending upon the case.
Method	The experience gained from the Nε–H tautomer of HisGly led us to inspect all of the low energy structures finally obtained at the ab initio level, and change some torsions when it appeared that a related structure might be of lower energy based on the criterion of enhancement of the hydrogen bond network.
Conclusion	We believe it is this combination of random and hydrogen bonding searches that may lead to an efficient determination of most, if not all, of the low energy conformers.
Conclusion	Yet the present work does not aim at providing an exhaustive description of these very complex potential energy surfaces.
Method	Ab initio calculations were carried out at levels which represent a compromise between accuracy and tractability for consideration of a significant number of structures.
Method	Geometries were optimized at the HF/6-31G(d) level, vibrational analyses were carried out at the same level to determine zero-point vibrational energies, thermal corrections to total energies, and entropies.
Method	Final energetics were determined at the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p) level using the HF/6-31G(d) geometries, a level of computation which has been previously shown to yield accurate energetics.18
Method	All results mentioned below are computed at this MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) level except otherwise noted.
Result	Relative energies computed at the HF and MP2 levels were usually found to be in satisfactory agreement with each other (differing by less than 10 kJ mol−1, and often by less than 5 kJ mol−1).
Result	It turned out, however, that in some cases the differences were as large as 10–25 kJ mol−1.
Result	A careful inspection showed that such large differences occur when the conformers being compared have the C-terminal carboxylic acid in different conformations (cisvs. trans).
Result	Test calculations on acetic acid itself indicate that the cis-trans relative energy is 7 kJ mol−1 lower at the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) level, compared to the HF/6-31G(d) result.
Result	Moreover, low energy structures always bear a trans carboxylic acid that is H-bond donating, and this H bond is not very accurately described at the HF level.
Result	Since the energy differences between the best structures of the two tautomers turned out to be very small for both dipeptides, additional calculations were carried out.
Method	The geometries of the most stable conformers were optimized at the MP2/6-31G(d) level, and final energetics were recomputed at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G(d) and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(−f)//MP2/6-31G(d) levels.
Method	In the latter “(−f)” indicates that the most diffuse f functions on C, N and O, and the most diffuse d functions on H have been dropped from the regular aug-cc-pVTZ set As described in the text, these more accurate levels lead to relative energies in reasonable agreement with the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) values.
Result	In particular, there was no change on the energetic ordering.
Method	Monte Carlo calculations were carried out with HyperChem 6.0,19 while the Gaussian03 package was used for ab initio calculations20.
Method	Several different ways are conceivable for the description of conformers, for each of the tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis.
Method	This is due to the presence of seven weakly hindered rotors in each species: the Cα–C(O) and Cα–N of the main chain of each residue, the Cα–Cβ and Cβ–Cring of the His side chain, and the C–OH bond of the C-terminus acid.
Method	Describing each of the conformers by the value of the torsion angle around each of these bonds would be rather tedious, although it would carry all of the information.
Method	We have chosen to define families using a hierarchy of structural criteria (descriptors), of which several are non local.
Method	The first descriptor is the existence of a hydrogen bond between an atom of the main chain and the Nδ or Nδ–H of the imidazole ring.
Method	All of the low energy conformers determined in this work bear such a hydrogen bond; for instance for the Nε–H tautomer of GlyHis, the lowest lying conformer found without a hydrogen bond at Nδ is higher in energy than the most stable by 18 kJ mol−1.
Method	We denote the cyclic motif formed by such H bonds as “Cn”, meaning that the H bond generates a n-membered cycle.
Method	The various types of Cn structures, C6–C10, are depicted schematically in Scheme 2.
Method	The arrows in Scheme 2 are oriented from the hydrogen bond donor to the acceptor.
Method	For instance in the Nδ–H tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis, the Nδ–H bond can be a H-donor towards the carbonyl oxygen of His, generating a C7 motif.
Method	C7 motifs also exist for the Nε–H tautomers, in which the Nδ atom is a H-bond acceptor from an N–H bond of Gly in HisGly or the C-terminus OH bond in GlyHis.
Method	On the other hand, in none of the conformers is the Nε or Nε–H oriented in such a way as to engage in a H bond of any Cn type, because the dipeptide chain is too short.
Method	The second conformation descriptor is the conformation of the Cn ring.
Method	The types of ring conformations encountered in low energy structures are presented in more detail in Fig. 1.
Method	C6 rings connect the Nδ position to the main chain nitrogen of His, which is the peptidic nitrogen in GlyHis and the N terminus in HisGly.
Method	In both Nε–H tautomers, there are two possible conformations, chair and half-chair (see Fig. 1).
Method	Note that the half-chair may be inverted, leading to a different energy since steric repulsions with the rest of the molecule are different.
Method	In the Nδ–H tautomer of HisGly, a chair conformation is formed by H bonding from the Nδ–H to the amino terminus.
Method	For GlyHis, the H bond would point to the peptidic nitrogen, but the rigidity of the peptide linkage precludes formation of the C6 ring in this case.
Method	Other Cn rings may be formed in several isomers, but the C7 is the only one which occurs in all.
Method	The various C7 possibilities have been introduced above.
Method	We find two conformations for the C7, half-chair-like and boat-like.
Method	Hydrogen bonding is favored when the N–H⋯OC segment is nearly planar in both types of conformation, since it allows the N–H bond to point approximately towards an oxygen lone pair, and the two bond dipoles to be oriented favourably for electrostatic stabilization.
Method	This restricts significantly the flexibility of the C7 motif.
Method	As shown in Fig. 1, formation of a C8 ring is possible only for the Nδ–H tautomer of GlyHis, connecting the Nδ–H bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly.
Method	We found two conformations for this C8 which may be loosely defined as half-chair-like and boat-like.
Method	As for C8, a C9 ring is compatible with one isomer only; in this case it is the Nε–H tautomer of GlyHis, in which the H bond connects Nδ to one of the N–H bonds of the amino terminus.
Method	The C9 ring is associated in some cases with a C6 ring, when the main chain is oriented in a way which also permits interaction of Nδ with the peptidic N–H bond.
Method	Finally, C10 rings exist in both tautomers of HisGly.
Method	In the Nδ–H tautomer it is due to a H bond between the Nδ–H bond and the oxygens at the C terminus, while in the Nε–H tautomer, the H bond is between the C terminus O–H bond of the trans conformation of carboxylic acid and Nδ.
Method	In both cases, we find two conformers, which are deduced from each other by a 180° rotation around the Cα–N bond of Gly (see Fig. 1).
Method	This leads to opposite orientations of the OC−N–H peptidic group with respect to the mean plane of the C10 cycle.
Method	The third descriptor is the relative orientations of the peptidic OC–N–H plane with respect to that of the C terminal carboxylic acid.
Method	There are two rough relative orientations: either coplanar, defining a fragment of a β sheet, or perpendicular.
Method	Finally, the fourth descriptor is the relative position of imidazole and of the peptidic plane.
Method	“Open” conformers correspond to extended structures, in which the Gly residue and imidazole are distant, i.e. they cannot interact via H bonding.
Method	“Closed” conformers are such that such H bonds can be established, between the Nδ position of His and an atom of either the peptidic bond or of the C terminus.
Method	Altogether, each existing combination of these four descriptors defines a “family”.
Method	We have noted these families with capital roman numbers, in the stability order.
Method	For instance for the Nδ–H tautomer of GlyHis, the lowest energy conformer belongs to family “I”, which corresponds to the existence of a C7 ring, in a boat-like conformation, in a “closed” relative orientation of Gly and imidazole, and a perpendicular relative orientation of the peptidic and carboxylic planes.
Method	Within each family, there remain conformational differences.
Method	These are specified by the orientation of the terminal NH2 and COOH groups.
Method	The various possibilities encountered in low energy structures are gathered in Fig. 2, together with the numbering used hereafter.
Method	For instance in conformations “1” the NH2 terminus is a H bond acceptor towards the peptidic N–H, while in “2” it is a H bond donor towards the peptidic oxygen, etc.
Method	In conformations “a” the carboxylic C terminus is in its trans conformation and it is a H bond donor towards the peptidic oxygen, while in “b” it is cis, and a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H.
Method	There is some redundancy between these notations and the specification of the Cn rings, since, e.g., conformations 5 are C9 rings (see Fig. 2).
Method	For all isomers, the most stable conformer of each family is depicted in Fig. 3–6.
Method	In order to illustrate the conformational flexibility offered by the NH2 and COOH termini, the six most stable conformations of the most stable family of the Nδ–H tautomer of GlyHis are shown in Fig. 7.
Result	The relative energies of all conformers, grouped in five families according to the descriptors defined above, are gathered in the left part of Table 1.
Result	The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the first five families are shown in Fig. 3, while a series of conformers of family I are shown in Fig. 7.
Result	The best structure overall is I-1-ad, which bears a C7 ring with a H bond from the Nδ–H to the His carbonyl oxygen.
Conclusion	In order to maximize H bonding, the carboxyl group is trans, enabling H bond donation from its O–H bond to the peptidic oxygen (which happens to be a C7 ring of another type, not used herein for structure specification).
Conclusion	The so-defined orientation of the peptide linkage is such that its N–H bond may interact with the π cloud of imidazole.
Result	At the same time, the NH2 terminus is oriented in such a way as to be a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H.
Conclusion	This structure is particularly stable since all heteroatoms are engaged in H bonding, except for the Nε (for which it is structurally impossible).
Result	The second most stable conformer is I-2-ad (see Fig. 7), 10 kJ mol−1 less stable than I-1-ad.
Result	The only difference between I-1-ad and I-2-ad is the orientation of the CH2NH2 at the N-terminus.
Result	In I-1-ad, the amino terminus is a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H, while in I-2-ad it is a double H bond donor to the peptidic oxygen.
Result	In all cases studied herein, we find the same energy ordering between these two orientations of the N terminus.
Result	The next conformer of the same family (the fourth most stable overall) is I-3-ad, which differs from I-2-ad by the orientation of the amino terminus, which interacts with the peptidic oxygen via a single N–H bond rather than both.
Conclusion	The fact that this single N–H bond is better oriented towards the peptidic oxygen than either of the N–H bonds in I-2-ad does not compensate completely for the loss of one interaction, leading to a destabilization of 3 kJ mol−1 (i.e. 13 kJ mol−1 less stable than I-1-ad).
Result	Other conformers of the same family have the carboxyl group in the cis conformation.
Result	Although it is intrinsically more stable than the trans (by 22 kJ mol−1 in acetic acid), it does not allow simultaneous H bonding to the oxygen carbonyl on the one hand, and from the O–H bond on the other.
Result	The most stable of such conformers is I-1-d, which differs from I-1-ad only by the orientation of the OH group.
Result	It lies 17 kJ mol−1 higher in energy.
Result	Other conformers add to this another less favourable interaction relative to I-1-ad, such as the orientation of the amino terminus, or the hydroxyl oxygen instead of the more basic carbonyl oxygen as a H bond acceptor (see Fig. 7), and are more than 20 kJ mol−1 less stable than I-1-ad.
Problem	We now turn to the lowest energy conformers of other families.
Result	The most stable structure in family II, II-1-b, shown in Fig. 3, bears a C8 ring.
Result	Here it is the peptide carbonyl oxygen, rather than that of the carboxyl terminus, which interacts with the Nδ–H bond of imidazole.
Result	The peptide linkage is oriented in such a way as to allow H bond donation from the peptidic N–H to both the amino terminus and the carbonyl oxygen of the C terminus.
Result	It is 12 kJ mol−1 less stable than I-1-ad.
Result	The most stable structure in family III, III-1-b, has a C8 ring analogous to that in family II, however, in a boat-like conformation.
Result	The peptide linkage has the same orientation as II-1-b, and thus forms the same H bonds involving the amidic hydrogen.
Result	The most stable structure in family IV, IV-1-bd, has a C7 ring involving the C-terminus carbonyl oxygen as in family I, however, the ring has a half-chair-like conformation, while it is boat-like in family I. The two families also differ by the relative orientations of the peptidic and C-terminus planes (third descriptor above), perpendicular for family I and parallel for family IV.
Result	This parallel orientation is common with family II, and it allows again the peptidic N–H bond to interact with both termini.
Result	This leaves the peptidic carbonyl oxygen without a H bond, so that this structure is less stable than I-1-ad by 14 kJ mol−1.
Result	Family V has a C7 ring of the same type as that of family I, but they differ by their conformation: half-chair-like in I, and boat-like in V. With a cis carboxyl group leaving the OH bond without H bonding, the most structure of family V, V-1-d, lies 16 kJ mol−1 above I-1-a.
Result	Some additional, generally less stable, conformers of this species may be found in Table 1.
Result	The relative energies of all conformers are gathered in the right part of Table 1.
Result	The most stable conformers for each of the first seven families are shown in Fig. 4.
Result	As for the most stable conformer of the Nδ–H tautomer, the most stable structure (I-1-jb) involves a boat-like C7 ring, which is closed in this case by a O–H⋯N bond from the C terminus to the imidazole Nδ.
Result	For this to occur, the carboxyl group is in its trans conformation, another feature that is common to both tautomers.
Result	The main chain has parallel peptide and carboxyl groups, and has glycine and imidazole in an open arrangement.
Result	This allows the peptidic N–H to interact with both the C-terminus carbonyl oxygen and with the amino terminus.
Conclusion	On the other hand, the open structure precludes any interaction of the peptide carbonyl, which may explain why this conformer is less stable than the best Nδ–H conformer (see Table 1; at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G* level, this difference is 6.5 kJ mol−1).
Result	The second most stable conformer (I-2-jb, not shown) resembles the first, the only difference being that the amino terminus is a H bond donor towards the peptidic carbonyl, rather than an acceptor from the peptidic N–H.
Result	Thus the lower portion of the conformational spaces of the Nδ–H and Nε–H tautomers are fairly similar.
Result	The third most stable structure is also the first of family II (II-1,5-b, see Fig. 4).
Result	It has a C9 ring connecting the amino terminus to the imidazole Nδ, and in addition, the relative orientations of the peptide linkage and of the carboxyl group, and of the main chain and the imidazole, enable the formation of a C6 ring between Nδ and the peptidic N–H.
Result	This structure is 7 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than I-1,5-jb.
Result	A structure analogous to that of II-1,5-b, with a C9 ring and planar main chain, is found with IV-1,5-b (the seventh most stable conformer in Table 2).
Result	However the C9 conformation is different, precluding the formation of a C6 ring.
Result	This conformer is only 3 kJ mol−1 less stable than II-1,5-b.
Conclusion	It is likely that the loss of a H bond is partly compensated by a smaller strain, permitting better relative orientations of the amino terminus and the peptidic N–H for H bonding.
Result	A slightly more stable structure is the best conformer of family III, III-1-f.
Result	Its favourable features are a C6 ring and a H bond from the peptidic N–H to the amino terminus.
Result	However, none of its carboxyl oxygens can engage into H bonds, which is why this structure is 8 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than I-1-jb.
Result	Another structure shown in Fig. 4 is V-1-b, which has a stable, planar main chain skeleton, but which lacks a H bond to the imidazole Nδ.
Result	This leads to a high energy, 18 kJ mol−1 higher above I-1-jb.
Result	Other structures in Fig. 4, the most stable of families VI and VII, are of even higher energies.
Result	There are also conformers of intermediate energies, in the 12–20 kJ mol−1 range above I-1-jb, which are not described in detail here, but for which the specification of descriptors in Table 2 should be reasonably explicit.
Result	The relative energies of all conformers found are gathered in the left part of Table 2.
Result	The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the eight families identified are shown in Fig. 5.
Result	The best conformer, I-1-h, has a boat-like C7 ring which involves the peptidic carbonyl, as compared to the carboxyl carbonyl in GlyHis.
Result	In addition, the perpendicular orientations of the peptidic linkage and the carboxyl terminus enable the latter to interact with the Nδ–H of imidazole, forming a C10 ring.
Result	The favourable orientation of the amino terminus towards the peptidic N–H, already described previously, also permits some interaction of one of its N–H bonds with the π cloud of imidazole.
Result	As seen in Table 2, this is the most stable conformer, however, it is slightly less stable than the best conformer of the Nε–H tautomer.
Result	The most stable conformer of family II, II-1-b (see Fig. 5), differs from I-1-h by the orientation of the Gly backbone, with the terminal carbonyl interacting with the peptidic N–H rather than with Nδ–H.
Result	This is a weaker interaction, essentially a dipole–dipole interaction of the CO and N–H bonds with antiparallel dipoles, rather than a H bond.
Result	As a consequence, it is less stable than I-1-h by 5 kJ mol−1.
Result	The next two conformers (not shown) are higher congeners of family I, differing from I-1-h only by the orientation of the COOH group.
Result	They are less stable than I-1-h by 6–8 kJ mol−1.
Result	The next most stable structure is the first of family III (III-4-h, see Fig. 5).
Result	It has a C10 ring as does I-1-h, but with a different conformation (of type a for III-4-h), in which the C7 ring no longer exists.
Result	Although the amino terminus –N–H peptidic bond interaction is maintained, together with that of one amino N–H with the π cloud of imidazole, the lack of the C7 ring leads to a destabilization of 12 kJ mol−1.
Result	Structure IV-1-h, the next higher conformer, presents a b-type C10 ring, no C7 ring, and has no amino N–H-imidazole stabilization.
Result	It is about 1 kJ mol−1 less stable than III-4-h.
Result	Several conformers belonging to the III, IV and I families follow with increasing energies, and the first members of families V-VIII (shown in Fig. 5) are all at least 20 kJ mol−1 less stable than I-1-h.
Result	The relative energies of all conformers found are gathered in the right part of Table 2.
Result	The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the seven families identified are shown in Fig. 6.
Result	The best structure, I-1-a, involves a C6 ring in a half-chair conformation (as do the next two most stable, I-1-f and I-1-b).
Result	The amino terminus is both a H bond donor, to Nδ, and an acceptor, from the peptidic N–H.
Result	As discussed above, the latter interaction is common in low energy structures.
Result	The carboxyl terminus adopts a trans conformation to act as a H bond donor to the peptidic carbonyl.
Result	Its other typical, cis conformation, is adopted in I-1-f, which is 7 kJ mol−1 less stable.
Result	Thus here again, the most stable structure involves a trans carboxylic acid.
Result	The first member of family II, II-1-i, is the fourth most stable overall.
Result	Its ring is a C10, and it is now the carboxyl terminus in its trans conformation which behaves as a H bond donor towards the Nδ.
Result	Again the amino terminus can accept H bonding from the peptidic N–H, however, both carbonyl oxygen are left without significant interaction, leading to an energy 10 kJ mol−1 higher than that of I-1-a.
Result	While the C7 ring was clearly the most favorable for the three previous isomers, in this case the only possibility to form a C7 is to bind the peptidic N–H bond to the Nδ, which is incompatible with H bond donation of the peptidic N–H to the amino terminus.
Result	Not only is the C7 not the best ring in this case, but the most stable conformer bearing a C7, III-2-b, is found to lie 15 kJ mol−1 higher than I-1-a.
Result	The first member of family IV, IV-3-b, has a conformation very close to that of III-2-b.
Result	They differ only by the C7 conformation (half-chair-like in IV-3-b).
Result	Another C7 occurs in family V, V-2-a, with the same C7 conformation as in IV-3.
Result	The difference consists in the perpendicular orientation of the acid function with respect to the peptidic plane (third descriptor).
Result	This orientation allows the carboxyl group in trans conformation to make a H bond to the peptidic carbonyl, instead of being cis and bind electrostatically with the peptidic N–H (as in IV-3-b).
Result	As a balance of these changes, the energies of these three conformers III-2-b, IV-3-b and V-2-a are very close and differ only by 3 kJ mol−1.
Background	Amino acids are known to have zwitterionic structures in aqueous solution in the biologically significant range of pH (ca. 6–9).
Background	In the gas phase, the positive and negative charges cannot be as efficiently stabilized as they are in solution, and the zwitterions are expected to be much less stable.
Background	In fact, all available evidences point to structures without formal charges in the gas phase.
Problem	Thus we expect that for dipeptides such as HisGly and GlyHis, zwitterions are not the most stable isomers either.
Problem	Yet it was deemed necessary to check this issue computationally.
Problem	The number of stable conformers for the zwitterions of the tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis is expected to be significantly smaller than for the “neutral” structures described above.
Result	Preliminary calculations indeed showed that many structures lead to collapse to non-zwitterions.
Result	As expected, the most favorable structures involve direct interaction between one of the carboxylate oxygens and one of the ammonium N–H bonds.
Background	For such motifs to be stable against proton transfer from the ammonium to the carboxylate, at least one of the charges must be stabilized by a second hydrogen bond, for instance O− by the imidazole Nδ–H, or N+–H by the imidazole Nδ.
Result	In all cases, the zwitterions were found to be much less stable than many conformers without formal charges.
Result	The smallest difference found between the best zwitterion and the best “neutral” conformer is for the Nε–H tautomer of HisGly, where it is 89 kJ mol−1.
Result	This zwitterion happens to have a structure that is fairly similar to that reported for the crystal structure of the hemihydrate of HisGly.7c
Background	Since all zwitterions are so high in energy, they are not described further here for the sake of brevity.
Result	All of the low energy structures determined in this work (in a range of ca. 20 kJ mol−1) bear a Cn ring.
Result	Moreover, this ring is a C7 in the most stable conformers of three out of the four isomers.
Result	In these three cases, the ring conformation is boat-like.
Result	Clearly whenever the skeleton is compatible with such a motif, it is highly favorable.
Result	A feature that is common to all four lowest energy conformers, is the N-terminus conformation, in which the amino group is a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H bond.
Result	Finally, in three out of the four cases, maximizing the strength of hydrogen bonding leads to a trans carboxyl group being present in the most stable conformer, even though it is intrinsically much less stable than the cis conformer.
Result	As expected, though, the specificities of the various isomers are such that not all of the descriptors can take similar values for all most stable conformers.
Conclusion	The relative orientations of the peptide linkage and the carboxyl group, the relative orientations of the Gly skeleton and the imidazole ring, and the cis or trans conformation of the carboxyl group, lead to structures that are significantly different, in order to optimize the network of hydrogen bonds.
Conclusion	Comparison of the energies of the most stable conformers, for the Nδ–H and Nε–H tautomers, indicate that the most favorable tautomer of GlyHis is the Nδ–H, while that for HisGly is the Nε–H.
Result	The energy differences are 4 and 1 kJ mol−1 for GlyHis and HisGly, respectively, at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G* level, including ZPE correction.
Conclusion	Such values are too small to draw a safe conclusion regarding the lowest energy tautomers, therefore they were recomputed with more accurate geometries and final energetics.
Result	At the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G* level, the energy differences between the tautomers are found to be slightly increased, to 5 kJ mol−1 for both GlyHis and HisGly.
Result	At the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(-f)//MP2/6-31G* level, they increase again, and amount to 7 kJ mol−1 for GlyHis and 8 kJ mol−1 for HisGly.
Conclusion	These results leave little doubt that the most stable tautomer is Nδ–H for GlyHis and Nε–H for HisGly.
Problem	The low energy conformation spaces for the sodium complexes of the four isomers are expected to be significantly restricted as compared to those of the free peptides, since previous studies21 have shown that multidentate binding of Na+ is a strong stability factor in its complexes with amino acids and oligopeptides.
Background	For GlyGly, it was shown that the most stable structures involve ion interaction with both carbonyl oxygens, differing by the interaction, or lack thereof, with the amino terminus.22
Problem	In GlyHis and HisGly, our results above suggest that for the Nε–H tautomers, the imidazole Nδ nitrogen may be an additional chelation site.
Problem	It may also be anticipated that interaction of sodium with part or all of the imidazole π electrons will introduce an alternative binding capability, open to both types of tautomers.
Method	Because the number of low-energy structures is much less for sodium complexes than for free peptides, we do not introduce descriptors, and mostly describe the structures in terms of the sodium chelation sites and intramolecular H binding they involve.
Result	The principles summarized above are illustrated by the relative energies of the most stable structures (see Table 3 and Fig. 8): the most favorable chelation of sodium is to both carbonyl oxygens and the imidazole ring.
Result	Since strong binding to Nε is sterically impossible, the ion interacts with the π cloud of imidazole.
Result	In both I and II, Na+ is bound to both carbonyl oxygens, and sits above the plane of imidazole, with closer interaction with one of the CN bonds.
Result	The two structures differ by the orientation of the NH2 terminus: it interacts with the peptidic N–H in I, while it is a H-bond acceptor from the imidazole Nδ–H in II.
Result	The distances from sodium to its chelation partners are almost the same in both cases.
Result	I is more stable than II by 12 kJ mol−1.
Result	A third structure of the same type, III, differs from I by the terminal acid which is cis in I and trans in III, with the O–H bond pointing towards the peptidic nitrogen.
Result	Since the latter is not a particularly strong H bond acceptor, III is less stable than I by 20 kJ mol−1.
Result	A fourth structure, V, is also bound to sodium via the same sites as I, II and III.
Result	It now has the NH2 terminus interacting with the peptidic CO.
Result	As seen above for the conformations of the free peptides, this is less favorable for NH2 than interacting with the peptidic N–H.
Result	V is less stable than I by 28 kJ mol−1, and is essentially degenerate with structure IV, in which the peptidic CO is H-bound to the Nδ–H of imidazole rather than to sodium as in the previous cases.
Result	The remaining, less stable structures of this isomer (V, VI and VII) all have sodium bound to the two carbonyl oxygens only.
Result	In all cases, the peptidic N–H bond interacts with both the NH2 terminus and imidazole in varying orientations.
Result	These three structures have similar energies, 30–40 kJ mol−1 higher than that of I.
Result	Here as for the Nδ–H tautomer above, the most stable structures involve chelation to both carbonyl oxygen (see Table 3 and Fig. 9).
Result	However the most favorable binding mode of Na+ to imidazole is no longer to the π cloud, but rather to the Nδ nitrogen.
Result	This tridentate binding is found in I, II, IV and VI.
Result	In the lowest three of these structures, the NH2 terminus is in its most favorable conformation, interacting with the peptidic N–H.
Result	I and II differ by the side chain conformation of His.
Result	In I it is such that imidazole is closer to the C terminus, while it is closer to the main chain and peptidic carbonyl in II.
Result	I and II are isoenergetic.
Result	II and IV share a similar main chain conformation, however, in IV the C terminus acid is in its less favorable trans conformation.
Result	This enables interaction of the acid O–H with the peptidic nitrogen, albeit not strongly enough to compensate for the acid destabilization.
Result	A better compromise is obtained in III, where Na+ interacts with the carbonyl oxygens and the N terminus nitrogen.
Result	Here the acid is trans as in IV, with the O–H now pointing towards the Nδ of imidazole.
Result	This leads to favorable H binding with a O–H⋯N bond angle of 164°.
Result	Yet this structure is less stable than I by 14 kJ mol−1.
Result	Another type of intramolecular H bond is found in V and VII, in which it is the peptidic N–H which binds to the Nδ.
Result	These two structures have very similar backbones, with both carbonyls bound to Na+.
Result	They mostly differ by the conformation of the N terminus, and it is the interaction of NH2 with Na+ (in V) rather than with the peptidic N–H (in VII) which is the most favourable.
Result	Finally, VI differs from II by the NH2 conformation, and as seen several times before, H donation to the peptidic CO is less favourable than H acceptance from the peptidic N–H, by 25 kJ mol−1 in this case.
Result	The results are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 10.
Result	As for the Nδ–H tautomer of GlyHisNa+, interaction of the ion with the Nε of imidazole is not possible, therefore Na+ interacts with the π cloud.
Result	However in this case, a significant difference may be seen: the most stable structure does not involve Na+ chelation to both carbonyls, but rather to the peptidic carbonyl and the NH2 terminus, and sits on top of the ring.
Result	This arrangement allows for efficient H bond donation from the Nδ–H to the C terminal carbonyl oxygen, with a relatively short H⋯O distance of 2.03 Å.
Result	More importantly, the N–H⋯O and H⋯OC angles are 160 and 143°, respectively.
Result	The reason why the Nδ–H tautomer of HisGlyNa+ is unique is that this H bond involves a C10 cycle (see Scheme 2) with enough flexibility to allow for nearly optimum N–H⋯OC orientation.
Result	In contrast, in the GlyHisNa+ Nδ–H tautomer, there is only a C7 or C8 possible between the Nδ–H and the terminal or peptidic CO, respectively (see, e.g., isomers IV of GlyHisNa+ in Fig. 8 with N–H⋯O and H⋯OC angles of 145 and 129°).
Result	In the Nδ–H tautomers of GlyHisNa+ and HisGlyNa+, the Nε–H bond cannot form any significant interaction; the Nδ–H bond can indeed engage into H bonds (see, e.g., isomers III of GlyHisNa+ in Fig. 9), but this can only occur at the expense of imidazole no longer being a sodium ligand.
Result	Therefore it is only in Nδ–H HisGlyNa+ that such imidazole N–H bonding can compensate for the loss of a carbonyl ligand to Na+.
Result	All other structures have Na+ bound to the two carbonyl oxygens and to the π cloud of imidazole.
Result	They differ by two main characteristics: (i) the conformation of the side chain of His is such that imidazole is closer either to the C terminus (as in II and IV) or to the peptidic chain (as in III and V), and (ii) the orientation of the amino terminus.
Result	The latter is a H bond acceptor from the imidazole Nδ–H in II and III, from the Cε–H in IV and provides a fourth chelation site to Na+ in V. These four structures span an energy range of less than 20 kJ mol−1, while II is 6 kJ mol−1 less stable than I.
Result	The results are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 11.
Result	As with the Nε–H tautomer of GlyHisNa+, strong interaction of the ion with the Nδ of imidazole is possible, so that the most favorable chelation of sodium is to both carbonyl oxygens and the Nδ in I. Yet the next two structures in stability order, II and III, have Na+ bound to Nδ, the peptidic oxygen and the amino terminus, differing only by the conformation of the C terminus.
Result	Both are very close in energy, 22 and 24 kJ mol−1 higher than I. Structures IV and VI have the same tridentate chelation as I, however, now the conformation of His side chain is such that imidazole is closer to the peptidic chain, rather than to the C terminus as in I. As a consequence, the amino terminus is a H bond donor to the peptidic oxygen in IV and VI, rather than being an acceptor from the peptidic N–H as in I. These differences lead to IV and VI being less stable than I by 26 and 32 kJ mol−1, respectively.
Result	Finally, Na+ is only bound to two sites in V and VII.
Result	V is more stable than VII by 8 kJ mol−1, because its two ligands are the two carbonyl oxygens.
Result	As seen for other cases previously, it has a trans acid which allows for hydrogen bonding, to the Nδ in this case.
Result	Yet with only two chelation sites to Na+, it is less stable than structure I by 31 kJ mol−1.
Conclusion	A comprehensive study of the low energy structures of both tautomers of GlyHis and HisGly, and their sodium complexes has been described.
Result	Compared to what has been described previously in the literature for GlyGly, the side chain of His provides additional binding capability.
Result	While the Nε position is too remote for interaction, the Nδ can engage in H bonding either as an acceptor or as a donor, depending upon the tautomer.
Result	This capability has a strong influence on all low energy structures of the four peptides.
Result	Maximizing the H-bonding also leads to the C-terminal carboxylic acid being in its trans conformation in three out of the four cases.
Conclusion	Overall, the most stable tautomer of gaseous GlyHis is found to be the Nδ–H, while that of HisGly is the Nε–H, however, the energy differences are small in both cases, less than 10 kJ mol−1 at all computational levels used.
Conclusion	Because of these small differences, the picture might be significantly changed in the condensed phase, especially in a protic solvent where intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds might be in competition.
Result	In the sodium complexes, the Nδ position of the imidazole side chain of His again has a strong influence on stability.
Conclusion	In the Nε–H tautomers, Nδ is an efficient sodium chelator or H bond acceptor, while in the Nδ–H, it may act as an acceptor, with Na+ interacting with the π cloud of imidazole.
Conclusion	The stronger ion–molecule interactions in the Nε–H tautomers lead them to be the most stable in GlyHisNa+ and HisGlyNa+.
Conclusion	These results illustrate the role of environment (here, sequence effects and ion chelation) on the relative energies of His tautomers.
Conclusion	It is highly probable that environment effects in proteins are even stronger.
Conclusion	Tautomeric forms of His in X-ray diffraction structures should therefore be assigned with caution.

Problem	Reaction pathways for growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under combustion conditions, a DFT study
Background	Models of soot formation include the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an essential step.
Problem	We investigate two reaction pathways for growth of PAHs, both initiated by radical formation.
Problem	The first type, the so called HACA mechanism, is based on stepwise acetylene addition and we identify promising reactions not considered before.
Problem	Examples are the synthesis of perylene and phenanthro[1,10,9,8–opqra]perylene.
Problem	The second type of reaction concerns direct condensation of phenyl, naphthyl or anthracenyl with another PAH.
Conclusion	Pathways for these reactions require merely up to 100 kJ mol−1 for the activation barrier, which makes them viable candidates for PAH growth.
Background	Soot is a typical byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion; this is undesirable since it indicates incomplete combustion and also entails a considerable health hazard.1
Background	Soot is at the same time a viable material if prepared with well defined properties, that can be achieved in pyrolysis from, e.g. methane, acetylene or other hydrocarbons.
Background	So produced, it has many applications in chemical industry and material science.2–5
Background	Detailed understanding of mechanisms of soot formation in combustions, pyrolysis, and also techniques such as carbon vapor deposition (CVD) are essential for controlling these processes.
Problem	It has been the main aim of the present work to better characterize the elementary reactions in the gas phase, which play a role in soot formation.
Background	The central issue is here the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are the main constituents of soot; the PAHs are also health hazards since they are carcinogenic.1
Background	The formation of the first aromatic ring under pyrolysis conditions has been studied by various groups.
Background	It appears that there are different types of growth reactions pathways depending on the fuel and actual conditions.6–9
Background	Starting from methane or acetylene as precursors Frenklach et al. propose a reaction for the formation of the first aromatic ring from n-C4H3 and acetylene.10,11
Background	Bittner and Howard suggest in addition the reaction of n-C4H5 with acetylene occurring especially at low temperatures.
Background	Miller and Melius pointed to a problem in these C4-routes: n-C4H3 and n-C4H5 should convert to the corresponding resonance stabilized isomers (iso-C4H3 and iso-C4H5).12
Background	Therefore, they recommend together with others6,13,14 a C3-route over propargyl radicals.
Background	For further growth (beyond benzene), the most popular mechanism is the hydrogen-abstraction/acetylene-addition, which is explicitly suggested by Bockhorn et al.15
Background	Independently Frenklach and coworkers refined a similar sequence of reactions10 and termed it the ‘HACA’-mechanism (Hydrogen-Abstraction-C2H2-Addition).16
Background	Böhm et al. have proposed a combination of a ring–ring condensation and acetylene addition,17 since reactions with acetylene alone apparently cannot describe the timescale of soot formation.
Background	A related model is proposed by Dong and Hüttinger, the so called particle-filler model:18 aromatic hydrocarbons constitute the molecular particles and acetylene the molecular filler.
Background	In this model the initial step leads to a biaryl bond, then followed by a dehydrocyclization reaction forming a five- or six-membered ring.
Background	Bays of PAHs involving three or four carbon atoms can be closed by addition of acetylene leading to five- and six-membered rings.
Background	With their model18 they are able to predict the texture of pyrolytic carbon: at low temperatures, low pressures, short residence times and high surface area/volume ratios, formation of sufficient amount of PAHs is limited thus leading to low-ordered carbon.
Background	On the other hand one gets a highly ordered carbon under high temperatures, high pressures, long residence times and low surface area/volume ratios.
Background	However, the temperatures should not be too high to avoid too fast growth.18
Problem	The present computational study is carried out to obtain energetic data for some reactions of interest in soot formation, as indicated above.
Background	We have shown previously that semiempirical PM3 calculations give occasionally considerable errors, e.g. 100 kJ mol−1 for the addition of a hydrogen atom to pyrene.19
Problem	In this work we describe different reaction pathways leading to PAHs; first we determine barriers and reaction energies for the HACA mechanism for naphthalene, acenaphthylene and phenanthrene as examples.
Method	As far as PM3 data are available,20 we compare these with our calculations.
Method	We follow here the HACA-mechanism and do not consider reactions like PAH + C2H; since the latter require additional hydrogen migration and can only proceed by a perturbation of the aromatic system.
Problem	Second we study aromatic condensation of PAHs; this should have a bearing on the model of Dong and Hüttinger.18
Problem	We assume that, as in the HACA process, condensation is initiated by radical formation, and then consider reactions of phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl with another PAH to yield for example fluoranthene or perylene.
Method	Reaction pathways of the polyaromatic growth have clearly been considered before, but these investigations have either been carried out at the PM3 level,20 or are limited to systems with ten carbon atoms at most;21–23 aromatic condensations have not been modeled before to our knowledge.
Method	Geometry optimizations have been carried out to locate minima and transition states with gradient corrected DFT methods as implemented in the TURBOMOLE program package.24–26
Method	We use mainly the functional B3LYP,27,28 since this is the standard tool for these purposes.
Method	In addition, all investigations have been done using the BP86 functional29–32 in combination with the very efficient RI-J approximation,33,34 which reduces the CPU times to about 10% of corresponding B3LYP calculations.
Method	This was done to ascertain the reliability of BP86, which offers the prospect to treat much larger systems.
Method	The standard TURBOMOLE basis set SV(P) (split valence augmented by a polarization d set on C) is employed35,36 and test calculations are performed with larger basis sets like TZVPP,37 and restricted open shell (ROHF-) RIMP2,38,39 and also ROHF-RICC.240
Method	Redundant internal coordinates are used in the structure optimization of minima.41
Method	Optimization of saddle points is performed with the TRIM (trust radius image minimization)42 method now implemented in TURBOMOLE.
Method	Harmonic frequency calculations are carried out for all species;43,44 all minima presented show only real frequencies and the first-order saddle points have only a single imaginary frequency.
Method	Reaction enthalpies are computed within the harmonic approximation using frequencies obtained from analytical second derivatives at B3LYP/SV(P) and BP86/SV(P) level, respectively.
Method	Let us first point out that accuracy requirements are relatively moderate for present purposes, since we are dealing with high-temperature reactions; pyrolysis is typically carried out at 1100 K–1300 K. To estimate the error in the barrier energies we consider the hydrogen abstraction with a hydrogen atom from the gas phase, since this is a crucial step for many of the reactions considered below.
Result	As first example we chose a radical reaction with small molecules for which experimental data are available CH4 + H → CH3HH → CH3 + H2.The barrier of the transition state calculated on DFT/B3LYP/SV(P) is +38 kJ mol−1 (+25 kJ mol−1 for DFT/BP86/SV(P)) and the experimental result is +50 kJ mol−1.45
Method	The next system considered is the reaction C6H6 + H → C6H5 + H2.
Result	In Table 1 we compare various methods and basis sets.
Method	ΔE1 denotes the difference between educts and transition state (barriers) and ΔE2 the difference between educts and products (reaction energies).
Result	Here, one can see that the computed ΔE decrease with increasing basis, and the smallest basis set gives values near experimental ΔE2, particularly for DFT/B3LYP/SV(P); this has also been pointed out by Houk et al.46
Result	The large deviation of the ROHF-RIMP2 and ROHF-RICC2 methods is caused by the (partial) multireference character of phenyl;47 the calculated values are simply not reliable.
Result	We have further considered the next larger system, naphthalene + hydrogen, the results are very similar to those listed in Table 1.
Method	B3LYP typically underestimates barriers by 10–35%,48,49 which is a well known and presently unavoidable deficiency, at least for systems of this size.
Method	We follow previous investigations20,50 and report ΔHR values under standard conditions within the harmonic approximation, we will comment on this in the summary.
Method	Frenklach and Wang have proposed that the growth of soot particles on surfaces takes place via the so called HACA mechanism.16
Method	This consists of the following steps: hydrogen abstraction creating a surface radical, acetylene addition to the radical formed, and ring cyclization as shown in Fig. 1.
Problem	The first reaction considered in this work, subsection 1, is the generation of acenaphthylene [6] from naphthyl radical [1] and acetylene, a five-ring cyclization at the smallest system representing a zigzag border.47
Problem	The second reaction, subsection 2, is a transformation of the five-membered ring to a six-membered ring by adding acetylene to an acenaphthyl radical [6a] resulting in a phenanthryl radical [17].
Problem	This reaction was proposed by Frenklach et al20. and we will compare their PM3 results with DFT (BP86 and B3LYP).
Problem	The next reaction, subsection 3, will also be compared with PM3: building a six-membered ring on phenanthryl [17] to form pyrene [23].
Problem	In subsection 4 we compare the HACA mechanism of Frenklach and the Bittner–Howard mechanism,51 where two acetylene are added in sequence to acenaphthyl [6a] leading to aceanthrylene [31].
Method	Fig. 2. shows the reaction enthalpies at 298 K for the acetylene addition to naphthyl radical [1] to yield acenaphthylene [6] and hydrogen.
Result	In Table 2 we compare calculated B3LYP and BP86 results for elementary steps of this reaction.
Result	The reaction is exothermic by 163 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (181 kJ mol−1 for BP86), the highest barrier of the total reaction path (relative to the educts) is 19 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (8 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	The reaction begins with the formation of [2] which proceeds to either [3] via hydrogen migration or to [4] under hydrogen atom loss.
Method	At B3LYP level the way to [3] shows a barrier of 26 kJ mol−1 (4 kJ mol−1 BP86), significantly lower than the one to [4] of 150 kJ mol−1 (147 kJ mol−1 BP86).
Conclusion	However, the reaction channel to [4] is exothermic and the barrier is moderate considering typical reaction conditions of pyrolysis.52
Result	The barrier of the ring cyclization of [3] to [5] is 42 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (28 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	Forming [6] under hydrogen loss has an activation barrier of 192 kJ mol−1, the transition state is just 2 kJ mol−1 above the energy of the final product (BP86 shows no additional barrier).
Method	The second reaction, Fig. 3 and Table 3, is the transformation from a five- to a six-membered ring.
Result	The reaction is exothermic by 312 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (320 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The HACA mechanism proceeds through formation of [11] and [16], respectively and the highest barrier of the reaction path is found to be 227 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (227 kJ mol−1 for BP86) for the formation of [11].
Method	The treatment of the first steps of the reaction path up to [10] is straightforward.
Result	But then we run into a problem: Educt [6a] and product [17] are radicals with clear cut doublet character (one singly occupied molecular orbital); a visualization of spin densities further shows the unpaired spin to be localized on a single center.
Method	The intermediates [11] and [16] give rise to three radical centers, which have to be coupled to a doublet.
Method	This is not possible in a clear cut way with standard DFT.
Result	Since the three singly occupied molecular orbitals in [11] are located on different centers, as indicated in Fig. 3, one has small exchange integrals and energies obtained with different spin distributions (ααα vs. ααβ etc.) are virtually identical.
Result	The differences amount to merely 4 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (and also for BP86).
Method	(On the DFT level [16] is actually a minimum for the quartet state, the energy in Table 3 is given in parentheses).
Conclusion	Our investigation leads to a new pathway starting from [10] over TS12, [14] and TS14 to yield [15], solid black line in Fig. 3.
Conclusion	This proceeds over clear cut doublets only (〈S2〉 = 0.78 for TS12) and avoids the problems just discussed.
Result	The barrier from [10] to TS12 is 182 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (153 kJ mol−1 BP86).
Conclusion	This should be the favored reaction pathway.
Conclusion	A comparison with Frenklach’s PM3 results20 shows reasonable agreement with present results up to [10], but we do not find indications that intermediates with three radical centers play a role for this reaction.
Method	The six-membered ring cyclization is depicted in Fig. 4 and the energetic results are presented in Table 4.
Background	Here also PM3 results are available.20
Result	We find an exothermic reaction of 257 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (268 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The highest barrier of the total path is calculated to be 29 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (15 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	Starting after the formation of [18] the radical has three possibilities to react.
Method	The first way is described in the two reactions discussed above: under hydrogen loss we get [21], which presents the same behavior as described in subsection 3.1.2 (C12H7 [6a] + C2H2 → C14H9 [17]).
Result	PM3 results show an endothermic reaction and DFT an exothermic pathway.
Method	The second way leads to [19] via ring cyclization and the last way is a H-migration from the C2H2 group to the six-membered ring [20] followed by ring cyclization [22].
Method	Both radicals, [19] and [22], decompose to pyrene [23].
Result	Discrepancies between PM3 and B3LYP (or BP86) are considerable, Table 4: the barrier height of TS20 from PM3 is 100 kJ mol−1, while it is 16 kJ mol−1 for DFT/B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	Furthermore the reaction enthalpies for the formation of pyrene differ by about 107 kJ mol−1 between B3LYP and PM3 (118 kJ mol−1 between BP86 and PM3).
Background	This has also been pointed out in a previous paper19.
Method	For this reaction we compare Frenklach’s HACA mechanism (solid line in Fig. 5), and the mechanism of Bittner and Howard,51 (dashed line in Fig. 5).
Background	Bauschlicher and coworkers have studied both mechanisms for a similar reaction: benzene + 2 C2H2 → naphthalene.53
Background	They found that both mechanisms have low barriers.
Result	The reaction is exothermic with 449 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (477 kJ mol−1 for BP86, see Table 5).
Result	The first step is the exothermic formation of [24] from [6a] and acetylene, which shows only a small barrier of 18 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (7 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and this is the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway.
Method	From this point the two pathways differ because in the HACA mechanism the second acetylene is added later than in the Bittner–Howard mechanism.
Problem	We first consider the Frenklach mechanism (solid line in Fig. 5).
Result	The hydrogen migration from the six-membered ring to the C2H2 group [26] has a barrier of 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (84 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	Again an acetylene addition leads to [28] with a barrier of 25 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (11 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	A ring cyclization [30] takes place without any barrier.
Method	The reaction ends forming aceanthrylene [31] by decomposition of [30].
Result	The Bittner–Howard mechanism on [24] is a direct addition of acetylene at the C2H2 group of [25] with a barrier of 20 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	This barrier is significantly lower than the step from [24] to [26].
Method	The 1,6-H-shift [27] has no barrier for BP86 calculations and a small one with the B3LYP functional.
Method	Another small activation barrier from [27] to [29] is found for the ring cyclization.
Method	Decomposition of [29] leads to aceanthrylene [31].
Conclusion	As a summary, we find that the Bittner–Howard mechanism is slightly favored, since the barrier for [24] to [25] is only 23 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Conclusion	This result is in line with that of Bauschlicher et al53. for the analogous reaction of benzene and two acetylene to form naphthalene.
Conclusion	The formation of [9] under hydrogen loss is not further investigated because the other pathways are significantly lower.
Problem	In the second part we consider the condensation of aromatic compounds.
Method	Two PAHs are connected to form a larger PAH under the formation of hydrogen molecule(s).
Method	We start again with number [1] counting the molecules.
Method	In the first reaction, subsection 1, benzene [1] reacts with naphthyl radical [2a] forming fluoranthene [8].
Method	The next reaction (subsection 2), is the condensation of naphthalene [2] with naphthyl radical [2a] to perylene [13].
Method	In the last process, subsection 3, anthracene [14] reacts with an anthracenyl radical [14a] to form phenanthro[1,10,9,8–opqra]perylene (phenanthroperylene) [22].
Method	Fig. 6 and Table 6 show the aromatic condensation of benzene [1] with a naphthyl radical [2a].
Result	The reaction is endothermic by 24 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the reaction path, relative to the educts, is obtained to be 85 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (60 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The analogous reaction of phenyl [1a] and naphthalene [2] is also calculated (dashed line).
Result	[3] is lower in energy than [4] by 39 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (37 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	This is due to the stabilization of the radical through the π-system.
Method	The next step is the separation of a hydrogen atom leading to [5].
Result	The energy of the barrier from [3] to [5] is found to be 132 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (126 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and from [4] to [5] it is 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (96 kJ mol−1 BP86).
Result	The following step is an assisted hydrogen abstraction under formation of H2 and [6] with a barrier of 51 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (36 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The barrier of the ring cyclization forming a fluoranthenyl radical [7] has been computed to be 52 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (37 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The final step is the decomposition to fluoranthene [8], through a barrier of 113 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (108 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	The second example for the aromatic condensation is the reaction of naphthalene [2] with a naphthyl radical [2a] to perylene [13], see Fig. 7.
Result	This reaction is slightly exothermic by 5 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (19 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway is calculated to be 65 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (45 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The first barrier, to get [9], is 27 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (16 kJ mol−1 for BP86) (Table 7).
Result	The radical is again stabilized through the π-system, as mentioned above for [3].
Result	Hydrogen loss leads to [10] over a barrier of 131 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (126 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	The following step is a hydrogen abstraction by forming a hydrogen molecule and [11].
Result	The barrier is 68 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (50 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The ring cyclization [12] has a small barrier of 25 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	Separation of a hydrogen atom gives perylene [13].
Result	The barrier is 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (108 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	The reaction of anthracene [14] with an anthracenyl radical [14a] is the third aromatic condensation, see Fig. 8 and Table 8.
Result	The reaction is exothermic by 24 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (47 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway, relative to the educts, is calculated to be 97 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (62 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	Starting with the addition of the two molecules one gets [15].
Result	The computed barrier is 21 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	Hydrogen separation leading to [16] has a barrier of 147 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (139 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Result	The following H abstraction under formation of H2 and [17] has a barrier height of 59 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (42 kJ mol−1 for BP86) similar to the two aromatic condensations discussed in subsection 1 and 2.
Result	A first ring cyclization follows, introducing a steric strain in the molecule [18].
Result	The barrier is 17 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (6 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Method	The next step is the second loss of hydrogen to [19].
Result	Then follows another hydrogen abstraction with a similar barrier as for the first one: 51 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (26 kJ mol−1 for BP86) for [20] and H2.
Method	The second ring cyclization leading to [21] occurs next.
Result	At BP86 level no barrier is obtained; B3LYP leads to an insignificant barrier of 1 kJ mol−1.
Method	Consequently, the ring closure takes place directly.
Result	The last step is a hydrogen loss with a barrier of 106 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (102 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Problem	We would like to mention briefly common features and differences of the aromatic condensation reactions.
Result	The crucial step for the smaller cases, see Fig. 6 and Table 6, is clearly the ring closure, e.g. from [6] to [7].
Result	The corresponding barrier is reduced in going to larger reactants, e.g. from +85 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP, Fig. 6, to +69 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP in Fig. 8.
Result	On the other hand, the hydrogen abstraction in the intermediates, e.g. from [19] to [20] in Fig. 8, is connected with increasing barrier if systems become larger; as example we mention the barrier of +51 kJ mol−1 (B3LYP) relative to the educts from 5 to 6 as compared to +97 kJ mol−1 (B3LYP) from [19] to [20].
Conclusion	We attribute this increase to the fact that the reaction center is more crowded in the larger systems, which hinders the reaction.
Conclusion	We expect that both trends continue, even if reactions of large PAH are considered.
Problem	We have considered a variety of reactions to rationalize soot formation, e.g. under conditions typical for pyrolysis.
Method	Our treatment is based on the assumption that radical formation, e.g. by hydrogen abstraction, is the initial step, on which the HACA mechanism is based too.
Method	We did not consider the reaction PAH + C2H, since these require additional hydrogen migration and can only proceed by a perturbation of the aromatic system.
Conclusion	We proposed some new reaction pathways, Fig. 5, and steps for the HACA mechanism, Fig. 3 from [10] over [14] to [15] or from [11] over [12] and [13] to [15].
Conclusion	Our investigations confirm that the reactions, once a radical is available, proceed with relatively low barriers to make this good candidates for growth of PAHs and soot particles.
Conclusion	As a byproduct we confirm a previous result that PM3 is occasionally insufficient for a semi-quantitative description.
Conclusion	We have further considered condensation of two PAHs, one of them again assumed to be a radical.
Conclusion	For three typical reactions, Figs. 6–8, we have obtained reaction pathways, which proceed with barriers of typically less than 100 kJ mol−1.
Conclusion	This implies that these condensations could play an important role in soot formation.
Conclusion	The influence of entropies can easily be computed within the harmonic approximation; since we are dealing with radical reactions there could be a non-negligible contribution from the electronic term in the entropy.
Conclusion	We point out that the temperature dependency is in the ΔH term and the entropy is in the pre-factor of the Arrhenius equation, which in the modeling of kinetics is typically used as an adjustable parameter.
Result	Lets come back to the temperature dependence mentioned in section 1, a temperature raise from 298 K to 1100 K has only a minor influence on ΔHr: about 6 kJ mol−1 for the first reaction of the acetylene addition and about 20 kJ mol−1 for the first aromatic condensation (benzene + naphthyl radical) (within the harmonic approximation).
Result	We regard this again as not essential.
Conclusion	The calculations have been carried out at B3LYP level, which appears the standard choice for this type of investigations.
Conclusion	These results have been compared with those employing the BP86 functional, which always yields lower barriers but virtually identical reaction energies.
Conclusion	The deviations up to 35 kJ mol−1 in barriers and 28 kJ mol−1 in reaction energies appear not to be a serious problem under typical pyrolysis conditions (1300 K).
Conclusion	Since the non-hybrid functional requires typically 10% of CPU times necessary for B3LYP, this paves the way to treat systems with up to 100 atoms.

Problem	Environmental effects on a conical intersection: A model study
Background	Excited-state processes at conical intersections (CIs) involving charge transfer phenomena can depend sensitively on the influence of a polar and polarizable environment.
Problem	We propose here a formulation to describe the chromophore–environment interaction for such situations.
Method	In a model study, we focus on an extension of the two-electron two-orbital model by V. Bonačić-Koutecký, J. Koutecký, and J. Michl [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1987, 26, 170], which yields a diabatic model for the S1–S0 CI in protonated Schiff bases and related systems, and describes the charge properties and charge translocation phenomena associated with this CI.
Method	The electrostatic effects of the environment, which are expected to strongly affect the CI topology, are accounted for by a dielectric continuum model.
Result	This translates to the image of free energy surfaces for the coupled chromophore–environment system represented by molecular coordinates plus a solvent coordinate.
Problem	The environment's impact on the location and character of the CI is investigated.
Problem	The limiting situations of “frozen” and equilibrium solvation effects are examined.
Background	Conical intersections (CIs), i.e., multidimensional, cone-like topological structures at degeneracies between Born–Oppenheimer surfaces, are known to play a key role in the ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited molecular systems.1–4
Background	Their great relevance for biochemical and biological systems has been confirmed over the past decades.5,6
Background	By their particular topology, CIs act as “photochemical funnels” which effectively and selectively induce transitions between electronic states.
Background	While such processes have been extensively studied in gas phase species, the influence of an environment on conical intersections has not yet been systematically investigated.
Background	For example, the recent study involving two of us in refs. 7–9 is the first explicit investigation of solvent effects on the ground state reaction path near a CI, and the QM/MM type calculational approaches of refs. 10, 11 provide an avenue to the microscopic description of both ground and excited states in an environment.
Problem	In the present contribution, we discuss a new approach to modeling the environment's influence on the excited-state processes at a conical intersection.
Background	The importance of understanding environmental effects on the processes at and near CIs is highlighted by a number of recent studies of biologically relevant systems, notably the chromophores of the rhodopsin family12–14 and other photoactive proteins,15–20 porphyrin-quinone complexes,21 as well as the building blocks of DNA.22,23
Background	These studies reveal the crucial role of CIs and suggest that a solvent or protein environment has a pronounced impact on the electronic structure and CI topology.
Background	Due to the environment, CIs can indeed be substantially displaced, or may even disappear.
Background	Given the complexity of these systems, a key step in the theoretical analysis is to select the relevant features which determine the energetics and dynamics of the chromophore–environment supermolecular system.
Problem	In the present work, we focus on situations where the CI involves a charge transfer process and therefore couples strongly to the environment's electrostatic properties.
Background	This is of relevance, in particular, for the S1–S0 CI in protonated Schiff bases (PSBs) like retinal, which plays a key role in the chromophore's cis–trans isomerization and can be associated with the translocation of a positive charge.24
Background	Charge transfer has also been shown to characterize the earliest events in the photoactive yellow protein, PYP, photocycle.10
Problem	The theoretical model developed within is designed to capture the electrostatic aspects of the chromophore–environment interaction and is thus specifically adapted to such situations.
Method	At the level of description adopted here (which allows for considerable generalization), the model involves (i) a description of the environment as a dielectric continuum (Section 2) which translates to a solvent coordinate picture, previously exploited in models for charge transfer reactions strongly coupled to large amplitude nuclear motion, see e.g.refs. 7, 25–29, in conjunction with (ii) a representation of the chromophore's electronic structure in a diabatic basis of states which are constructed such as to preserve their charge character in the nonadiabatic coupling region.
Method	This type of basis is best adapted to formulate the interaction with a polar and polarizable environment.
Method	(The term diabatic is here meant in a loose sense, to describe a basis which has “smooth” properties and approximately diagonalizes the nuclear kinetic energy operator.1,2)
Method	In this first effort, we focus on a simple realization of such a basis in terms of valence bond (VB) type states suitable for the description of PSBs, as an extension of the two-electron two-orbital model by Bonačić-Koutecký, Koutecký, and Michl5,6,24,30 (Section 3).
Result	The description of the environment as a dielectric continuum leads to an augmented electronic structure problem yielding free energies; the latter carry a parametric dependence on the chromophore's internal degrees of freedom plus a solvent coordinate representing the environmental polarization field.
Result	The solvent coordinate thus appears as an additional degree of freedom which, for the coupled free energy surfaces at the CI, plays a substantial role in determining the CI topology and the concerted chromophore–environment dynamical path.
Problem	In the present context, we examine the two extreme cases of a “frozen” solvent vs. equilibrium solvation situation (Section 4).
Background	While the present work focusses on the case of a small chromophore in solution phase, the theoretical framework we are developing is generalizable to take into account the specific nature of the environment, by referring to microscopic solvent coordinate concepts,31–34 with emphasis on the environment's heterogeneous character.
Background	This opens up an avenue to treat very general types of system–environment situations, in particular (i) complex molecular systems, even gas phase species, characterized by a local site which interacts with an intramolecular “bath” involving charged and polarizable groups, and (ii) large molecules in a solvent environment, where the local site of interest interacts with an effective environment comprising intramolecular and solvent components.
Background	For a chromophore embedded in a protein via electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and covalent interactions, the local environment bears features of both cases (i) and (ii).
Problem	The present work maps out the very first steps towards such complex environments.
Background	The paper is organized as follows.
Background	Section 2 addresses the general theoretical formulation leading to a free energy surface description of the combined chromophore–environment system.
Background	Section 3 introduces the extended two-electron two-orbital model we use to describe the coupled S1–S0 states in protonated Schiff bases.
Background	In Section 4, we address the charge properties, free energy surfaces, and solvent effects for the CI model.
Background	Section 5 summarizes some future perspectives and concludes.
Method	We adopt a description of the environment via a dielectric continuum model, i.e., the environment is described in terms of a polarization field interacting with the electric field created by the solute.
Method	The polarization field can be represented as the sum of two components, P(x) = Pel(x) + Por(x) where x denotes a field point in the solvent, and the sum refers to an electronic (“fast”) component Pel associated with the electronic solvent degrees of freedom and an orientational (“slow”) component Por associated with the solvent dipoles' reorientation in response to the solute field.
Method	This latter component determines the non-equilibrium effects in the solvation dynamics: There is no requirement in general that the orientational polarization be in equilibrium with the molecular solute's charge distribution in its dynamical evolution.
Method	As detailed in refs. 35 and 36, the interacting solute–solvent system can be characterized via a free-energy functional G[ψel, Pel, Por].
Method	Here, the interaction with the environmental polarization fields is added to the molecular electronic Hamiltonian, thus defining an augmented electronic structure problem.
Method	Minimization of G yields solutions which depend parametrically on two types of “slow” variables: the internal nuclear coordinates of the chromophore R, and the slow polarization component Por.
Method	These solutions G(R,Por) are adiabatic free energies, by analogy with the adiabatic energies of the conventional wavefunction description.
Method	Importantly, a nonequilibrium process can be described in terms of the dynamics on such free energy surfaces G(R,Por).
Method	This necessitates the introduction of a kinetic energy for Por.25,26,37–41
Method	Time scales of nonequilibrium solvation are generally similar to the internal molecular degrees of freedom dynamics: picoseconds to femtoseconds.
Method	While the solution to the combined solute–solvent electronic structure problem is non-trivial, and in general necessitates a quantum treatment of the electronic polarization field35, we focus here on a particular limiting situation: The solvent electronic polarization adjusts rapidly to the solute's electronic configuration and can therefore be adiabatically eliminated.
Background	In electron transfer language, the electronic polarization is fast compared to the transferring electron.
Method	This limit is characterized by the condition 2β/ℏωel ≪ 1 in terms of the electronic coupling β, which sets the electron transfer time scale, and the characteristic solvent electronic polarization energy ℏωel.
Method	This condition is applicable to an important class of charge transfer reactions in various solvents.
Method	This Born–Oppenheimer (BO) limit35,42 leads to the following, simplified, form of the free energy functional35GBO[ψel, Por] = Hmol[ψel,Por] + Gint[ψel,Por] + Gel[ψel] + Gor[Por]with the following contributions:
Method	(i) the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian H0 of the isolated molecular system, Hmol[ψel,Por] = 〈ψel|H0|ψel〉for the solution phase solute electronic wavefunction ψel(xel;R,Por) which has a parametric dependence on the nuclear degrees of freedom R and on the orientational polarization field Por;
Method	(ii) the solute–solvent interaction Gint, i.e., interaction between the polarization Por and the solute electric field ψ, Gint[ψel,Por] = –(1 – 4πC–1el)∫ dx ψ·Porwhere Cel = 4πε∞/(ε∞ – 1), with ε∞ the optical dielectric constant;
Method	(iii) the electronic polarization contribution Gel, for an electronic polarization Pel field which instantaneously equilibrates to the solute electric field ψ,
Method	(iv) the orientational self-free energy contribution Gor, with Cor = 4π(1 + ε0 – ε∞)/(ε0 – ε∞) where ε0 is the static dielectric constant.
Method	We note that the free energies resulting from minimizing the functional eqn. (2) can be formulated as the eigenvalues of an effective Hamiltonian.35
Method	In the above expressions, the electric field ψ generated by the solute is35,36 ψ(x; R) = –∇φ(x; R) with the potential produced at point x in the solvent by the solute electronic density ρ(x′;R).
Method	The latter is the single-particle density derived from the electronic wavefunction, ρ(x1; R) = N∫ dx2…dxN ψel(x1,…,xN;R)ψel*(x1,…,xN; R)
Method	We will focus within on the case where the wavefunction is expressed in a basis of states {ϕj(xel;R)}, each of which corresponds to a fixed charge distribution.
Background	These states are what we term valence bond (VB) states and constitute an appropriate basis for including the interaction with the external polarization fields.
Method	The solute charge distribution can thus be written28,35,36 with component densities ρij(x1,R) = N∫ dx2…dxNϕi(x1,…xN;R) × ϕ*j(x1,…,xN;R).
Method	This partitioning carries over to the potential φ = ∑ij φij and to the electric field, ij = –∇φij, such that the solute–solvent interaction takes the form.
Method	Thus, components of the interaction free energy can be associated with the field generated by the component solute charge distributions ρij.
Method	The orientational polarization also couples to the off-diagonal components i ≠ j, corresponding to the “exchange” field components,35 giving rise to off-diagonal terms in the diabatic representation for the free energy and leading to a diabatic coupling renormalization35,36,43,44.
Method	The interaction free energy partitioning eqn. (10) is taken as a basis to define solvent coordinates associated with each component.35,36
Background	To calculate the individual contributions, knowledge of the nonequilibrium polarization field Por is required, and necessitates approximations in the absence of a complete representation of the field.
Method	One useful approach is the representation of Por in terms of linear combinations of equilibrium contributions.
Method	In particular, the nonequilibrium polarization can be expressed, in a chemical reaction context, in terms of a single solvent coordinate z37,41 which weights the equilibrium contributions in the reactant (R) and product (P) states, Por(x;R) = (1 – z)Peqor,R(x;R) + zPeqor,P(x;R) Here, the off-diagonal components i ≠ j of eqn. (10) have been neglected.35
Background	(We will later identify R and P in the CI context).
Method	With eqn. (11) for the polarization field, the “Marcus-like” free energy parabolas are obtained, displaced along the solvent coordinate z.
Method	The free energies of eqn. (12), denoted by a subscript s, comprise components in the interaction free energy Gint of eqn. (4), the electronic solvent free energy Gel of eqn. (5), and the orientational self free energy Gor of eqn. (6).
Method	The GR,Peq(R) are the equilibrium free energies for the R and P states, i.e., the free energies with Por equilibrated to the charge distributions in R and P, respectively.
Method	The “solvent force constant” is ks(R) = k0s∫dx[Peqor(x, R) – Peqor, P(x, R)]2, with k0s = 4π/(1 – ε∞/ε), and is directly related to the reorganization energy λ(R) = ks(R)/.237,41
Background	Note that all relevant quantities – in particular, the equilibrium polarization fields, the solvent force constant, and the reorganization energy – carry a dependence on the internal molecular coordinates R, due to the solute electric field ψ dependence on R.
Background	Conical intersections of charge transfer type, i.e., involving a transition between an ionic and a covalent state, constitute a generic class of conical intersections in polar double bond systems.45
Background	Among these, as anticipated in the Introduction, protonated Schiff bases (PSBs) may be considered a paradigm example, for which S1–S0 isomerization can proceed via a CI, for both the CC and CN bonds.5,6,24,30,46
Background	While the chromophores in question in fact exhibit a complicated electronic structure, with various CIs of different types, notably of one-bond flip (OBF) and hula-twist (HT) type,45 we focus here exclusively on an OBF mechanism which only involves a twist around the CC double bond, rather than a concerted twist/flip process for several neighboring bonds.
Background	The CIs in question occur at a twisted geometry of the double bond – often close to 90°30,47–50 or, according to our model, at exactly 90°24,30 – and thus correspond to a biradicaloid structure.
Background	The two-electron two-orbital model developed by Bonačić-Koutecký and Michl24,30 in the late 80s explains the occurrence of such CIs by a degeneracy, at a biradicaloid geometry, of a covalent (“dot–dot”) and ionic (“hole-pair”) type configuration.
Background	A key observation of the model is that the electronegativity difference across the double bond, measured by a parameter δ,24,30 determines whether a CI can actually be found: With increasing values of δ, the S1 state is stabilized until an S1/S0 degeneracy is met at a threshold value.
Background	The model thus explains that, while no CI is found for twisted ethylene (δ = 0), in the absence of asymmetric perturbations as induced, e.g., by pyramidalization, CIs do occur for PSBs.
Background	The relevant PSB electronic configurations can be represented in an approximate fashion in a basis of localized p orbitals, which are best adapted to the biradicaloid structure at the twisted geometry.
Method	A minimal model for the S1–S0 conical intersection can be formulated in terms of the two singlet states24,30 with the notation A ≡ pA and B ≡ pB for two p orbitals on neighboring carbon centers, and |Σ〉 = (1/√2)(α1β2 – β1α2) the singlet spin configuration.
Method	The |AB〉 state corresponds to the dot–dot configuration mentioned above while the |B2〉 state is one of two hole-pair configurations.
Method	(The complementary |A2〉 configuration is assumed to be shifted to high energies, due to the effect of the asymmetry parameter δ.24,30)
Background	A detailed description of the model is given in .ref. 51
Result	The two configurations eqn. (13) have different locations of the positive excess charge carried by the PSBs.
Background	If one thinks of the following partitioning in terms of the left and right hand PSB moieties (see also refs. 49, 47), where the vertical bar indicates a cut through the CC double bond, the charge characteristics of the basis states may be described in a short-hand notation,i.e., the positive charge is localized on the nitrogen end for the |AB〉 state and on the hydrocarbon end for the |B2〉 state.
Background	A charge translocation24 therefore takes place upon the transition between these two states.
Background	The {|AB〉,|B2〉} states represent a charge-localized, valence bond (VB) type basis, and provide a simple realization of a more general type of diabatic representation which preserves the basis states' charge character in the nonadiabatic coupling region.
Background	At the 90° twisted geometry, the |AB〉 and |B2〉 states are uncoupled due to symmetry reasons51 and describe biradicaloid configurations.
Background	Twisting away from θ = 90° induces a non-zero overlap and, hence, π-binding effects between the p orbitals on neighboring centers, such that the |AB〉 and |B2〉 states are mixed.
Background	The twisting coordinate θ therefore acts as a coupling, or symmetry-breaking, coordinate.24,30,51
Method	The solution phase diabatic free energy model we adopt takes the following form, where the coordinate r (associated with CC stretch motion) plays the role of a tuning coordinate,1 which only contributes to the diagonal terms and thus modulates the energy gap between the two diabatic states.
Method	The solvent coordinate z also acts as a tuning coordinate via the diagonal terms in eqn. (16).
Method	Generally, the electronic coupling γ(θ) is not identical to the coupling in the isolated chromophore; it also includes the interaction with the orientational polarization field eqn. (10), γ(θ) = γ0(θ) – (1 – 4πC–1el)∫dx ex·Porvia the “exchange” field component ex related to the off-diagonal component density ρij with i = |AB〉 and j = |B2〉.
Method	(We have suppressed the explicit dependence of γ on Por(x;r,θ) in the notation).
Method	The solvent-induced component thus leads to a renormalization35 of the coupling.
Background	Further, at a CI, the solvent-induced coupling can have a symmetry-breaking effect: i.e., a coupling can be induced by the solvent for θ = 90° while γ0(θ = 90°) = 0 by symmetry for the isolated chromophore.
Background	In this case, the CI is shifted away from θ = 90°.
Background	We consider this type of effect no further here.
Method	The model eqn. (16) should be taken to correspond to the simplest scenario which gives a qualitatively correct picture for the S1–S0 intersection in PSBs.
Background	Different interpretations are currently given as to whether an effective two-mode model is in fact viable to describe the dynamics in various retinal analogs and other PSBs.
Background	While Robb, Olivucci and co-workers indeed supported a two-state-two-mode model in their recent work,49 Martínez and co-workers47 provided evidence that, besides the torsion and the CC stretching mode (or a concerted stretching motion across the PSB carbon skeleton), the C–N stretch plays an important role in the branching space of the S1–S0 conical intersection.
Conclusion	Our model could be extended in view of these findings.
Method	The model eqn. (16) is parameterized in an approximate fashion for the internal modes (r, θ) and solvent coordinate z; Table 1 lists the relevant parameter values.
Background	While we do not explicitly make contact with the electronic structure side in the present study, we suggest as a future strategy to fit ab initio data to the model under consideration.
Method	The diagonal contributions VAB(r,θ) and VB2(r,θ) in eqn. (16) include (i) a Morse form in the stretch coordinate r, (ii) a θ-dependent shift term which displaces the minimum of the Morse potential for increasing θ, and (iii) a diagonal angle-dependent term chosen according to the study by Tennyson and Murrell for ethylene.52
Method	Hence, VAB(r,θ) = VABmorse(r) + VABshift(r,θ) + VABθ(θ)with the individual termsVABmorse(r) = DAB(1 – exp[–αAB (r – r0,AB)])2where r0,AB is the CC equilibrium distance at the planar geometry, and an angle dependent shift potentialVABshift(r,θ) = ξAB(r)sin2θwhich is adjusted to shift the minimum of the Morse curve to its appropriate value at θ = 90°.
Method	Here, ξAB(r) = cABshift (r – r0,AB)exp(–|r – r0,AB|/σr) with cABshift = –2DABα2ABΔrAB, for a shift ΔrAB in the minimum geometry.
Method	Note the exponential which is added to attenuate the effect of the linear term for increasing distance from the minimum geometry.
Method	Further, the diagonal contribution in the torsion is given asVABθ(θ) = cABθcos2θwith cABθ < 0 such that the diabatic ground-state potential is bonding for θ = 0°, see .ref. 52
Method	Similarly, the diagonal potential for the hole-pair state |B2〉 reads , with definitions analogous to eqns. (19), (20) and (21), in addition to an energy shift ΔEB2 with respect to the |AB〉 state.
Method	The coupling between the |AB〉 and |B2〉 states is given as γ(θ) = c(1)γcos θ + c(3)γcos3θin accordance with the models developed for ethylene by Domcke, Manthe and co-workers53 and, for the contribution in cos θ, by Tennyson and Murrell.52
Background	The physical origin of the term in cos θ is a resonance integral, proportional to the overlap between the p orbitals on the neighboring centers;24,54 the third-order term should be understood as a higher-order correction conforming to the required symmetry.
Problem	We restrict the present analysis to the term in cos θ.
Method	Finally, the solvent free energies GABs and correspond to two displaced parabolas in accordance with eqn. (12), with the same equilibrium free energies and force constants ks, The free energies eqn. (23) are analogous to, e.g., the model developed in refs. 55, 56 for charged polyenes.
Method	An estimate for the solvent force constant ks = 2λs (here assumed to be independent of the internal coordinates), with λs the solvent reorganization energy, can be obtained from the Marcus–Born model37,41 where the solute charge distribution is surrounded by a cavity in the dielectric continuum.
Method	The reorganization energy λs is then related to the work required to transfer charges from the reactant to the product cavity.
Method	Here, a value of ks = 2.5 eV is used, which has been derived for acetonitrile8 but is also applicable in an approximate fashion to other solvents.
Method	The following analysis is based on the two-state, three-mode model of eqn. (16), with the twisting coordinate θ as a coupling mode, the CC stretch coordinate r as a tuning mode, and the solvent coordinate z as an additional tuning mode.
Problem	We will successively address the resulting potential surfaces and their topology for the isolated chromophore (Section 4.1), the associated charge distributions resulting from the mixing of the {|AB〉,|B2〉} states and their decoupling at the 90° twisted geometry (Section 4.2), and the inclusion of the solvent (Section 4.3).
Result	Fig. 1 shows the coupled S1 and S0 surfaces for the isolated chromophore, obtained by diagonalizing the matrix eqn. (16) excluding the solvent contribution.
Result	The surfaces feature a CI at θ = 90°, which coincides with the minimum of the upper adiabatic surface.
Result	Fig. 2a shows a cut of the potential surface along the torsional coordinate, at a value of the CC stretch coordinate corresponding to the intersection point, r = r0CI.
Result	The cut illustrates that while the coupling vanishes for θ = 90°, the diabatic vs. adiabatic surfaces increasingly diverge when moving towards the planar geometry.
Result	Fig. 2b shows a complementary cut for the CC stretch potential at the 90° twisted geometry.
Background	We pause to note that while our analysis focuses on the conical intersection region, the work by Robb, Olivucci and co-workers48,49 shows that the earliest dynamical events in the isomerization of short-chain retinal analogs (subsequent to the Franck–Condon (FC) excitation to S1 at planar geometry) involve a pronounced displacement in the skeletal stretching modes.
Background	Our perspective relates to the second phase of the dynamical process which predominantly involves a displacement in the torsional coordinate, towards the conical intersection point.
Result	In this context, we note that the upper adiabatic surface of our model does not give an accurate representation of the Franck–Condon region: for the retinal analogs studied in refs. 48 and 49, the S1 surface is bound in the torsional angle for the initial planar geometry.
Background	For a complete analysis of the reaction path, crucial for the understanding of the femtosecond to picosecond events, the model Hamiltonian has to be modified to account for this feature.
Background	Since the basis functions |AB〉 and |B2〉 are associated with fixed charge distributions, the charge properties of the adiabatic states S0 and S1 as a function of geometry can be derived from an eigenvector decomposition in terms of the VB type components.
Background	While the {|AB〉,|B2〉} states mix substantially for geometries away from θ = 90°, they decouple at the conical intersection.
Background	Hence, a pronounced polarization effect is expected when moving towards the conical intersection.
Result	This effect is illustrated in Fig. 3, for the isolated chromophore adiabatic surfaces as depicted in Fig. 1.
Result	The figure shows the decomposition of the eigenvector corresponding to the S1 state in terms of its {|AB〉,|B2〉} components, as a function of the twist angle θ and the tuning coordinate r.
Result	A step function-like feature is observed for θ = 90° along r, reflecting that the adiabatic states correspond to different diabatic branches to the left and right of the conical intersection point (see also Fig. 2b).
Conclusion	Thus, while the S1 surface is predominantly of |B2〉 character close to the planar geometry, and is entirely |B2〉 along the line θ = 90°, for r < r0CI, the same surface is of |AB〉 character at and near θ = 90°, for r > r0CI.
Result	As can be inferred from Fig. 3, the discontinuity is smoothed out away from θ = 90°.
Result	An entirely complementary picture holds for S0, with the roles of the diabatic |AB〉 and |B2〉 states exchanged.
Result	The S0 surface is thus predominantly of |AB〉 character, apart from the charge reversal near θ = 90° for r > r0CI.
Conclusion	The prominent features of the charge distributions of the adiabatic states S0 and S1 can be summarized as follows: (i) a “polarization” effect when moving towards θ = 90° at a given r, as a signature of the |AB〉 and |B2〉 state decoupling, and (ii) a sudden charge character change when traversing the CI region along r, for values of θ near θ = 90°.
Conclusion	This change is step function-like at θ = 90°.
Background	The above observations in part agree with the picture described by Robb, Olivucci and co-workers48,49,57,58 and the results obtained by Martínez and co-workers47 for different retinal analogs.
Method	The S0 and S1 free energy surfaces derived by diagonalizing the matrix potential eqn. (16) depend on the two tuning modes r and z, in addition to the coupling mode θ.
Result	Hence, a seam of conical intersections results, i.e., a line in the (r,z) space for θ = 90°, depicted in Fig. 4.
Result	The minimum energy CI (MECI) is located at (r = 1.54 Å,z = 0.55); the slight departure from the midpoint z = 0.5 can be shown to follow from an analytic analysis.51
Background	(Note also the discussion in ref. 1 regarding the general tendency towards lowering of the MECI energy upon adding further tuning modes).
Conclusion	In the present system, the MECI point in fact represents the global minimum of the S1 surface.51
Result	As can further be inferred from Fig. 4, no CI exists for values of z below a certain limiting value, here z < 0.21.
Result	As z increases, the intersection point is shifted to smaller r values.
Method	The locations (r,z) along the CI seam are determined by the condition ΔV(r, θ = 90°) = –ΔGs(z) for a degeneracy of the two adiabatic states, given a vanishing coupling (θ = 90°), with ΔV(r, θ) = VB2(r,θ) – VAB(r,θ) and the solvent-induced free-energy gap The required degeneracy at the CI seam is thus achieved by matching the respective energy gaps induced by the two tuning coordinates r and z.
Method	According to eqn. (25), the solvent-induced free energy gap ΔGs(z) is a linear function of z and vanishes for z = 1/2.
Result	The maximum value of ΔGs(z) which allows for a CI to occur corresponds to z = 1, for a solvent equilibrated to the |B2〉 state.
Result	This point, at (r = 1.33 Å,z = 1,θ = 90°), coincides with the unique equilibrium point (EQCI) along the CI seam, see the discussion below.
Result	Importantly, the equilibrium CI point does not minimize the S1 free energy, i.e., the EQCI and MECI points do not coincide.
Result	This reflects the particular character of the CI topology, as further detailed below (Section 4.3.3). in connection with an equilibrium solvation perspective.
Background	The CI seam plays a key role for the S1 topology and, hence, the excited-state dynamics.
Background	The combined dynamical evolution in the internal coordinates and solvent coordinate z will ultimately tend towards the CI seam and the MECI point.
Background	In a manner depending on the nonadiabatic dynamics details, this will be followed by a path involving the solvent coordinate on the adiabatic ground state.
Background	In general, motion in the solvent coordinate z will be of a non-equilibrium character, i.e., the orientational polarization will not be that appropriate to the actual charge distribution in the chromophore as the latter evolves in r and θ.
Background	This necessitates consideration of the full three-dimensional surfaces G(r,θ,z).
Background	An approximate dynamical scenario for the nonequilibrium case is addressed in .ref. 51
Problem	In the remainder of this section, we focus on the solvent's effect on the chromophore for two limiting situations: (i) a “frozen” solvent polarization (Section 4.3.2). where the solvent coordinate is fixed throughout, imposing a pronounced nonequilibrium solvation situation, and (ii) the case of equilibrium solvation (Section 4.3.3). which implies extremely rapid solvent motion, adiabatically adjusting to the solute charge distribution.
Background	Both cases allow for a reduction from the three-dimensional (r,θ,z) space to effective free energy surfaces Geff(r, θ) in two dimensions.
Problem	For a frozen solvent polarization, determined by a particular value z, a single point on the CI seam is selected.
Background	Due to the correlation between the two tuning coordinates r and z along the seam, the value of z determines the location of the CI in r.
Method	Fig. 5 illustrates the adiabatic S0 and S1 surfaces as a function of r and θ, for two cases which represent equilibrium situations for the uncoupled |AB〉 and |B2〉 states at θ = 90°: (i) a solvent equilibrated to the |AB〉 charge distribution, zABeq = 0 and (ii) a solvent equilibrated to the |B2〉 charge distribution.
Method	For each fixed z value, a nonequilibrium solvation situation applies for all geometries away from θ = 90°, since the solvent polarization is not allowed to adjust to the actual solute charge distribution.
Result	With either condition eqn. (26) or eqn. (27), the solvent-induced free energy gap eqn. (25) takes a fixed value, of ΔGs(zABeq) = ks/2 and , respectively.
Result	The former does not allow for a degeneracy according to eqn. (24), such that the CI is actually lost for z = zABeq = 0.
Result	For , a CI does exist, at a value of r = 1.33 Å determined from eqn. (24).
Background	This point is in fact the EQCI point referred to above.
Result	For z = 1, the shift in location of the CI point leads to a change in CI topology from “peaked” for the isolated chromophore to “sloped”,59 further illustrated by the one-dimensional cut in Fig. 6.
Result	In this case, the minimum of the upper adiabatic (S1) surface along r no longer coincides with the CI; see also the discussion on the role of CI topology in refs. 60, 61.
Method	The condition of equilibrium solvation identifies the particular points on the free energy surfaces which correspond to a solvent orientational polarization field which is always in equilibrium with the chromophore's charge distribution at each given geometry (r, θ).
Method	These equilibrium points z = zeq(r, θ) are derived from the free energy condition ∂Gn(r, θ, z)/∂z = 0 where the index n corresponds to the adiabatic state in question.
Problem	We focus in the following on the situation where the solvent is equilibrated to the upper adiabatic surface S1.
Method	For the matrix potential eqn. (16), analytical diagonalization yields an explicit form for the adiabatic surfaces GS0(r, θ, z) and GS1(r, θ, z) and the corresponding eigenvectors.
Method	From this follows for the free energy derivative with respect to z, for S1, with c|B2〉(r, θ, z) the |B2〉 component of the S1 eigenvector.
Method	From the minimum free energy condition and eqn. (28), the geometry dependent equilibrium values are thus found as a solution to
Method	The case θ = 90°, with a vanishing diabatic coupling, represents a particular instance of eqns. (28) and (29).
Method	For this angle, eqn. (29) is the equilibrium condition for the diabatic states, (i) for the S1 branch corresponding to |B2〉, for r ≤ rEQCI, and (ii) zABeq = 0 for the S1 branch corresponding to |AB〉, for r > rEQCI.
Method	Note that the EQCI point at (rEQCI = 1.33 Å, zEQCI = 1) is the unique equilibrium point lying on the CI seam.
Method	(In general, all points fulfilling the degeneracy condition eqn. (24) for or z = zABeq represent EQCI points; the latter case is excluded in the present system as discussed in Section 4.3.2)..
Result	Fig. 7a shows the (r, θ) dependent solutions of eqn. (29) and illustrates the step function-like behavior versusr, at θ = 90°, at the EQCI point.
Result	The picture is the analog, for S1 equilibrium solvation, of Fig. 3a for the isolated chromophore.
Result	Detailed comparison of the two figures reveals that the equilibrium solvation case further exhibits a discontinuity in θ, at θ = 90°, along the whole |AB〉 branch of S1(r > rEQCI).
Background	This requires further explanation, now given.
Problem	To understand the origin of the discontinuity, we consider in Fig. 8 a projection of the three-dimensional G(r, θ, z) surfaces along z, at fixed r = r0CI = 1.59 Å and θ = 90° (panel a) vs.θ = 90° + ε (panel b).
Result	While the free energy minimum for the uncoupled case (a) corresponds to the diabatic minimum at zABeq = 0, the adiabatic S1 minimum in (b) is located at .
Result	The limiting value as θ approaches 90° is defined by the crossing of the diabatic states, and hence, the point (r = r0CI, z = 0.5) along the CI seam, i.e., .
Result	Since this limiting value does not coincide with the equilibrium point zABeq = 0 at θ = 90°, a discontinuity arises.
Result	A similar observation holds for all r values (within the range of existence of a conical intersection) such that the equilibrium points on the upper adiabatic surface tend towards the z values along the CI seam, Only at the EQCI point does the zseam value coincide with the true equilibrium value, zEQCI = zseam(r = 1.33 Å) = 1.
Result	Fig. 7b illustrates the limiting behavior eqn. (30).
Conclusion	While the overall seam does not conform to an equilibrium condition, its role as a limiting value according to eqn. (30) nonetheless turns out to be crucial for the topology of the free energy surfaces.
Result	This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the equilibrium solvation free energies .
Result	At θ = 90°, the free energies of both states approach the degeneracy at the CI seam, as a result of converging to zseam.
Result	Since the S1 and S0 surfaces thus tend towards a line of degeneracies, the topology is markedly different from the surfaces of Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 which exhibit a single CI point.
Conclusion	Conditions of equilibrium solvation with respect to S1 are therefore expected to induce enhanced nonadiabatic transition probabilities to the S0 ground state as compared with either the isolated chromophore or frozen solvent conditions.
Method	We have introduced a theoretical formulation to describe the environment's impact on a conical intersection (CI), which in this first effort has focussed on the environment's influence on the existence, location and character of the CI.
Result	This formulation describes the interacting chromophore–environment system in situations where electrostatic interactions are dominant such that the environment's orientational polarization field interacts strongly with the chromophore.
Method	The combined chromophore–environment system is characterized by free energy surfaces in the space of internal molecular coordinates plus one or several solvent coordinate(s).
Background	A first sketch is given of applying this formulation to the coupled S1/S0 states in protonated Schiff bases.
Method	The perspective we have developed is based on a free energy model including the solvent as an additional “tuning” mode which modulates the energy gap and displaces the CI.
Conclusion	The impact of a solvent can be substantial: For example, if the solvent is equilibrated to a solute state characterized by the charge distribution pertaining to one or the other diabatic state and then frozen, the conical intersection can be entirely lost, or its topology may be altered (here, from “peaked” to “sloped”).
Conclusion	For the opposite limit of extremely rapid solvent motion, equilibrium solvation free energies can be defined whose topology is determined by the CI seam: i.e., a line of intersections, rather than a single point in (r,θ) space.
Problem	Pronounced implications for the dynamics are thus expected for the different solvation limits.
Conclusion	In addition to these effects, the solvent can also have off-diagonal contributions, solvent-induced couplings, which have a symmetry-breaking effect at the geometries where the coupling intrinsic to the chromophore vanishes.
Background	A detailed discussion of the PSBs and related systems in the context of the present model will require an ab initio based parameterization including all relevant modes.
Background	In addition, the model should be further developed in view of the following aspects: (i) Extension of the free energy picture to molecular level interactions, beyond the dielectric continuum description (This leads to the definition of generalized, microscopic solvent coordinates31–34 and paves the way for the application of the present approach to complex environments), (ii) the development of general strategies to define an appropriate diabatic basis representation, chosen such as to exhibit a well-defined charge character, and (iii) a dynamical description including the solvent, leading to the image of a combined dynamical path for the chromophore–environment supermolecular system.
Background	This necessitates the combination of the nonequilibrium dynamics in the solvent coordinate with the quantum dynamics of the chromophore.
Background	Given the above elements, the present approach should contribute to clarifying various aspects of the environment's impact on the subpicosecond and picosecond dynamics in the PSBs.
Background	This relates, in particular, to the pronounced differences in the dynamics observed in solution phase as compared with the native protein environment: For the retinal chromophores of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, and similarly for the chromophore of the photoactive yellow protein, the decay observed in solution is much slower (of the order of 10 ps)18,63,62 than the decay observed for the native protein (of the order of 200–500 fs).12–15,17
Background	For both the solution phase and protein environments, an interesting comparison will arise from the comparison with QM/MM type approaches as developed, e.g., in ref. 10.

Problem	Specific deuterium isotope effects on the intramolecular charge-transfer dynamics of 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile
Problem	The photoinduced charge-transfer (CT) dynamics of 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) are studied for methyl-deuterated isotopomers DMABN-d6 (with two CD3 groups) and DMABN-h3d3 (with one CH3 and one CD3 group) by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.
Result	The asymmetrically deuterated species DMABN-h3d3 is found to exhibit less CT fluorescence in sufficiently polar solvents than the symmetric isotopomers of DMABN-h6 and DMABN-d6.
Conclusion	The results of fluorescence decay measurements are also reported, which suggest that the rate of backward electron transfer is increased upon asymmetric substitution of the dimethylamino group.
Background	The photoinduced charge-transfer (CT) reaction of DMABN in polar solvents has been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations.1,2
Background	This process is usually considered as a twisting motion of the dimethylamino (DMA) group with respect to the benzonitrile group to produce an emissive transient species called twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) state.3
Background	After finding similar behavior in many other molecules containing electron donor and acceptor groups, the rotamerism accompanying charge separation is most widely accepted.
Background	A wide variety of model compounds have been studied to explain the motion leading to the CT state.
Background	The so-called pretwisted compounds, such as sterically hindered ortho-methyl-derivatives of DMABN, are known to emit preferentially or only CT fluorescence in a medium polarity solvent.3,4
Background	The CT fluorescence is also observed in the static vapor5 and under supersonic jet conditions.6
Background	Since the DMA group in these compounds is already twisted in the ground-state structure, direct excitation of the CT state becomes possible.
Background	Other derivatives of DMABN, in which the amino group is rigid with respect the twist around the Namino–Cring bond, reveal only locally excited (LE) fluorescence.3,4
Background	These results are considered as evidence of the TICT scenario.
Background	On the other hand, neither the meta nor the ortho isomer of DMABN shows dual fluorescence even in strongly polar solvents.7
Background	The specific ring-substitution behavior has been ascribed to the large energy gap between the S1 and S2 states as compared to that of para-DMABN, leading to suggest a planar CT state.7
Background	Nonetheless, the nature of the structural change is not well characterized yet and under controversial discussion.
Background	Recently, we have measured S1–S0 spectra of methyl-deuterated isotopomers of DMABN (DMABN-d6 and DMABN-h3d3) in supersonic jets using resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI) spectroscopy.8
Background	The spectra of the deuterated isotopomers reveal low-frequency progression due to the torsional motion of the DMA group in the S1 state, essentially analogous to the protonated species DMABN-h6.
Background	Analysis shows that in all isotopomers the DMA group is twisted by ≈26° with respect to the ring plane under the isolated molecular condition.
Background	However, the DMABN-h3d3 spectrum exhibits additional bands with a less regular pattern, suggesting that the asymmetric deuteration of the DMA group induces extensive mixing of its torsional motion and other low-frequency motions in S1.
Problem	Possible candidates for these motions are predicted to be torsion of the methyl groups and pyramidarization at the amino nitrogen.
Background	It is therefore interesting to compare the CT dynamics of the symmetric and asymmetric rotors in polar solvents.
Background	Several examples of deuterium isotope effects on electron-transfer reactions have been reported, especially for those in the Marcus inverted region.9–11
Background	It has been shown that in intermolecular complexes between methyl-substituted benzene donors and cyanoanthracene acceptors, the backward electron transfer rate decreases substantially when the methyl hydrogens of the donor are deuterated.9
Background	However, no or insignificant isotope effect is observed upon ring deuteration.
Background	An asymmetric substitution effect has been suggested for intramolecular electron transfer reactions in bianthryls.12,13
Background	In this case, the so-called symmetry breaking is believed to be an important step for CT.
Background	Likewise, such symmetry reduction can be achieved upon complexation of bianthryl with other solvent molecules.
Background	It has been shown that the 1:1 complex with acetone formed in a supersonic jet reveals a red-shifted emission assignable to the CT fluorescence.14
Background	The complex is likely to have the solvent molecule sticking to one of the anthracene moieties, undergoing symmetry breaking and charge separation.
Background	On the other hand, no CT formation occurs for the 1:2 complex, which is explained by invoking a symmetric structure.
Problem	In this paper we report the results of the systematic study of the effect of deuterium substitution on the dual fluorescence behavior of DMABN in solvents of different polarity.
Result	The asymmetric isotopomer DMABN-h3d3 is found to reveal less CT fluorescence in moderately polar solvents than the symmetric ones (DMABN-h6 and DMABN-d6).
Result	In less polar solvents (e.g., 1,4-dioxane), on the other hand, the fully protonated compound gives rise to red-shifted fluorescence with higher efficiency than the deuterated isotopomers.
Problem	We have also employed a time-resolved spectroscopic technique to investigate the origin of the specific deuteration effects.
Conclusion	The results suggest that the backward electron transfer is facilitated upon asymmetric deuteration of the DMA group.
Method	These observations are interpreted within the framework of the TICT model.
Method	Commercial DMABN (DMABN-h6) was obtained from Aldrich and purified by vacuum sublimation before use.
Method	The methods of preparing the deuterium-substituted DMABN samples, (CD3)2N-C6H4-CN (DMABN-d6), and (CH3)(CD3)N-C6H4-CN (DMABN-h3d3) have been described elsewhere.15
Method	The isotope content (>99%) was confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy analysis.
Result	The DMABN-h3d3 sample showed traces (≈0.17%) of monomethylated impurities [e.g., (CD3)HN-C6H4-CN].
Method	A series of solvents of different polarities [cyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, n-butyronitrile, acetonitrile, 1-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, and water] were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co. These solvents were of spectroscopic grade and used as received.
Method	The sample concentration was 1 × 10−4 M.
Method	A Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer was used for the steady-state fluorescence measurements.
Method	The time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out by exciting the samples with the frequency-tripled output of a femtosecond laser (Spectra Physics Tsunami/Spitfire) at 266 nm and by recording the fluorescence with a streak camera (Hamamatsu Photonics).16
Result	The system response function was found to be ≈30 ps.
Result	Since the samples exhibit dual fluorescence, each fluorescence emission was collected separately through a monochromator.
Method	The fluorescence decays were fitted with exponential functions by taking account of the response function of the streak camera.
Result	The steady-state fluorescence spectra of three isotopomers of DMABN in 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, and acetonitrile at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 1.
Result	In each solvent, the absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra are essentially identical for the three isotopomers.
Result	The fluorescence spectra of the fully protonated species (Fig. 1) are in good agreement with previous measurements.4,17
Result	In the case of weakly polar dioxane (dielectric constant ε = 2.2 at 25 °C), the relative LE fluorescence intensity is strongest for DMABN-d6.
Result	With increasing the solvent polarity (ethanol and acetonitrile), the ratio for the asymmetric isotopomer DMABN-h3d3 becomes larger than those for -h6 and -d6.
Result	The symmetric species give nearly the same intensity ratios.
Background	This behavior cannot be ascribed to the monomethylated impurity described in the Experimental section, which is known to exhibit only LE fluorescence.17
Result	The fluorescence spectra of the three isotopomers in cyclohexane (not shown) appear to be identical.
Result	In all polar solvents studied, the relative intensity of the LE and CT fluorescence is found to be different for the three isotopomers.
Background	Ratios of the CT and LE fluorescence yields (ΦCT/ΦLE) can be obtained by separating the respective emission bands.
Result	The ΦCT/ΦLE ratios plotted against the dielectric constant of the solvent are shown in Fig. 2.
Result	It can be seen that in 1-butanol (ε = 17.1) or more polar solvents the ratio for the -h3d3 isotopomer is considerably lower than for the symmetric isotopomers.
Result	Furthermore, the ratios in protic solvents (propanols, 1-butanol, methanol, and ethanol) appear to increase monotonically with the polarity, but differ noticeably from those obtained with aprotic solvents of similar polarity [e.g., 1-propanol (ε = 20.1) and n-butyronitrile (ε = 20.4)].
Background	Fluorescence yield ratios have also been obtained for the three isotopomers with an excitation wavelength of 306 nm (not shown).
Result	The symmetry dependent behavior is essentially the same for the two different excitation wavelengths.
Method	Time profiles of the LE and CT fluorescence emissions have been measured separately for three DMABN isotopomers in each solvent.
Method	The selected spectral range chosen to follow the LE fluorescence kinetics is centered at 350 nm in dioxane and 355 nm in more polar solvents, whereas the CT fluorescence was measured with the observation window centered at 450 nm for dioxane and 490 nm for the other solvents.
Result	Each time-resolved fluorescence intensity appears to consist of two components, with a picosecond decay followed by a nanosecond decay for the LE emission and a picosecond rise followed by a nanosecond decay for the CT emission.
Method	Thus, the time-resolve fluorescence intensity can be described by the following equationswhere I(t)LE is the LE fluorescence intensity with the fast and slow decay lifetimes τfast and τslow, and the amplitudes Afast and Aslow.
Method	I(t)CT is the CT fluorescence intensity with the risetime τrise and decay lifetime τdecay, and the amplitudes Arise and Adecay.
Result	The decay profiles of the LE fluorescence obtained for dioxane, ethanol and acetonitrile are compared in Fig. 3.
Result	In each solvent, the profiles of the CT fluorescence are nearly identical for the three isotopomers.
Result	The fluorescence decay lifetimes and preexponential factors calculated by fitting the data to eqns. (1) and (2) are summarized in Table 1.
Result	As shown in Fig. 3, a small isotope effect is observed for the decay curves in dioxane.
Result	The fast decay lifetime of the LE fluorescence τfast increases slightly upon deuterium substitution.
Result	The value of 25 ps for the -h6 species is in good agreement with that reported by Schuddeboom et al.17
Result	Pronounced isotope effects occur in the case of ethanol and acetonitrile.
Result	The asymmetric deuteration leads to an increase in the magnitude of the slow decay component of the LE fluorescence.
Result	The ratio of the amplitudes of the fast and slow decay components (Afast/Aslow) for -h3d3 is calculated to be 6.3 for ethanol and 22.2 for acetonitrile.
Result	The corresponding values for the symmetric isotopomers are much larger (28.6 and 34.5 for -h6 and 76.9 and 83.3 for -d6).
Result	As listed in Table 1, the lifetimes of the fast and slow decay components of the LE fluorescence (τfast and τslow) are not significantly influenced by the isotope substitution.
Result	The result obtained for -h6 is in qualitative agreement with that reported by Changenet et al.18
Result	In all cases, the amplitude ratio of the rise and decay components of the CT fluorescence Arise/Adecay is nearly equal to –1, which implies that the CT state is formed through the LE state decay.
Result	Isotope dependent behavior obtained with methanol is very similar to the case of ethanol, except that the fast components τfast and τrise are much shorter than in ethanol.
Result	For all isotopomers in the protic solvents (i.e., ethanol and methanol), the CT fluorescence risetime τrise is found to vary with the emission wavelength: it increases as the observation window is shifted to a longer wavelength region.
Result	This implies that the CT fluorescence intensity distribution redshifts with time, which has been recognized previously18,19 and explained as a result of the longer solvent reorganization time in these solvents.
Result	In this case, the risetime of the CT fluorescence τrise does not match the fast decay lifetime of the LE fluorescence τfast.
Result	On the other hand, rapid equilibrium between the LE and CT states can be reached upon excitation in aprotic solvents, and thus τrise and τdecay of the CT fluorescence are nearly equal to the decay lifetimes τfast and τslow of the LE fluorescence, respectively.
Result	We have observed that in solvents of moderate and high polarity, the intensity ratio of the CT to LE fluorescence (ΦCT/ΦLE) of DMABN decreases upon deuteration of one of the methyl groups.
Result	This symmetry effect is contrasted with the case of the weakly polar solvent dioxane where the fully methyl-deuterated isotopomer gives the lowest ΦCT/ΦLE fluorescence ratio.
Result	Moreover, the time-resolved fluorescence measurements reveal that the asymmetric substitution leads to a substantial decrease in the ratio of the fast to slow decay component of the LE fluorescence (Afast/Aslow) in polar solvents.
Method	Here, we employ the kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) proposed by Grabowski et al3. to rationalize these observations.
Method	In addition, the TICT model is invoked in which the CT stabilization occurs as a consequence of the torsional motion of the DMA group.
Background	For DMABN in polar aprotic solvents, the excited-state equilibrium can be fully established within the lifetime, i.e., k1, k2 ≫ kLE, kCT, where k1 and k2 are the forward and backward reaction rate constants, respectively, and kLE and kCT are the decay rate constants of the respective excited states.
Method	In this high-temperature regime, the ratio of the LE fluorescence components Afast/Aslow can be associated with the ratio of the reaction rate constants k1/k2.
Method	The reciprocal of the short decay lifetime τfast corresponds to the sum of the forward and backward reaction rate constants k1 + k2.
Background	For DMABN in protic solvents, the risetime of the CT fluorescence is determined by the solvent reorganization time as described above.
Background	In this case, the reaction kinetics can be deduced from the LE state decays.18
Result	The rate constants k1 and k2 for the two aprotic solvents (dioxane and acetonitrile) derived based on the high-temperature approximation are listed in Table 2.
Conclusion	Comparison of the kinetic data in Table 2 suggests that the backward reaction rate constant k2 increases upon asymmetric deuteration, whereas the change in k1 is minor.
Result	It is also important to note that the emission maxima of the LE and CT fluorescence are identical for all isotopomers (Fig. 1), supporting that the energies of the LE and CT states are not shifted by the symmetry reduction.
Conclusion	Therefore, we conclude that the activation barrier for CT changes upon deuteration of one of the methyl groups.
Result	For DMABN-h6 in polar solvents, the activation energy of the backward reaction E2 is much larger than that of the forward reaction E1.
Result	Thus, the ratios of ΦCT/ΦLE and Afast/Aslow increase by lowering the temperature in the so-called high-temperature region.20
Method	The activation energies E1 and E2 have been obtained separately from Arrhenius-type plots of the decay rate constants.21
Result	In both protic and aprotic solvents, the observed Arrhenius activation energy E1 appears to be similar to the activation energy for the solvent mobility Eη.
Result	This implies the absence of intrinsic potential barrier for the forward reaction.21
Result	For example, the activation energy E1 in butyronitrile is obtained to be 10.5 kJ mol−1, which is comparable to Eη (9.2 kJ mol−1).
Result	On the other hand, the activation energy of the backward reaction E2 (15.9 kJ mol−1 in butyronitrile) is substantially larger than Eη, and a significant intrinsic barrier exists for this process.
Conclusion	On the basis of the barrierless reaction model, we propose that the pronounced asymmetric substitution effect on the CT dynamics in sufficiently polar solvents is due to vibrational coupling between the primary reactive mode, namely the twisting motion around the Namino–Cring bond, and other low-frequency motions (e.g., pyramidalization at the DMA group and torsion of the methyl groups).
Background	Among these nonreactive motions, pyramidalization is believed to be important in determining the CT dynamics of DMABN.4,22
Background	With very low pyramidalization, the activation energy for the CT reaction is lowered, leading to a barrierless reaction coordinate, as discussed above.
Conclusion	Therefore, asymmetric substitution of the DMA group exerts a minor influence on the forward reaction process.
Conclusion	In contrast, vibrational coupling with nonreactive modes will increase the density of states for the back CT reaction, thus lowering its barrier height.
Conclusion	The above interpretation is consistent with the absence of noticeable symmetry effect in dioxane.
Result	As shown in Fig. 1, the protonated species DMABN-h6 reveals the largest ΦCT/ΦLE value among all isotopomers.
Conclusion	In the weakly polar solvent, the forward reaction may also have an intrinsic barrier.
Conclusion	In this case, deuterium isotope effects prevail.
Background	The slower CT reaction rate for the deuterated species can be explained in terms of the torsional frequency of the DMA group, which decreases by ≈10% in going from -h6 to -d6.8
Background	While DMABN is known to be pyramidal in the ground state,23 increased conjugation upon excitation would be expected to lead to a more planar (with respect to inversion) conformation in S1.
Background	It has been suggested that its S1 inversion potential is very flat-bottomed.8
Background	On the other hand, the torsional geometry is planar in S0,23 while twisted in S1 by about 26° with a small barrier to planarity.8
Background	In this case, vibrational coupling between the torsion and inversion of the DMA group is expected to occur extensively upon excitation.
Background	Evidence in support of such coupling can be obtained from vibrational analysis of the S1 ← S0 spectra of three isotopomers.8
Background	Each spectrum, obtained in a supersonic jet, consists of a prominent low-frequency progression due to the DMA torsion.
Result	In addition to this, bands assignable to the inversion and its combination bands with the DMA torsion are apparent in the spectrum of the asymmetric isotopomer.
Result	The -h3d3 spectrum also reveals bands involving torsion of each methyl group (CH3 and CD3).
Problem	The increased coupling of the reactive DMA torsion with these nonreactive modes upon asymmetric substitution is expected to reduce the activation energy.
Problem	It is also possible to ascribe the observed symmetry effect to an increase of the preexponential (frequency) factor due to such mode coupling.
Conclusion	In conclusion, it is demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity ratio of the CT and LE emissions of DMABN decreases substantially upon deuteration of one of the methyl groups.
Conclusion	This asymmetric substitution effect can be observed only in polar solvents of medium and high polarity.
Result	The time-resolved fluorescence measurement reveals that the reverse electron transfer is facilitated in the asymmetric isotopomer, whereas no significant change occurs for the forward reaction.
Conclusion	This behavior is explained by mode coupling of the torsional motion of the DMA group with other low-frequency motions, which occurs strongly upon asymmetry reduction.
Background	However, more accurate decay data would be essential to determine unequivocally the origin of the asymmetric substitution effect.
