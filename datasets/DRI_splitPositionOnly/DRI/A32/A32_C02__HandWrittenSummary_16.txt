In order to capture realistic wrinkles on a real-life garment, from a mere geometric point of view, the number of triangles required can be easily up to a hundred thousand. Such a large number of triangles put cloth simulation off from interactive speeds. Based on this limitation the author presents a method to simulate realistic wrinkles on clothes without fine mesh and large computational overheads. As it is difficult to physically simulate real life wrinkles, the user designs them interactively as a bump map on a coarse mesh cloth/garment in 3D space. Then a wrinkle pattern geometrical deforms the triangle mesh of the targeted area animates it and finally renders it. This approach limitation is that it cannot be applied to strain pattern.
