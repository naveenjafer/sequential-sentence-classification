In this paper, we show how statistical modeling techniques can be combined with physics-based modeling techniques to address the limitations of both techniques. By accounting for physical constraints and statistical priors simultaneously, we not only instill physical realism into statistical motion models but also extend physics-based modeling to a wide variety of human actions such as stylized walking. The key idea of our motion modeling process is to learn nonlinear probabilistic force field functions from prerecorded motion data with Gaussian Process (GP) models and combine them with physical constraints in a probabilistic framework. We introduce a physically valid statistical motion model that combines physical laws and statistical motion priors and use it to create physically realistic animation that achieves the goals specified by the user. The incorporation of physical constraints into statistical motion models ensures generalized motions are physically plausible, thereby removing noticeable visual artifacts (e.g., unbalanced motions and motion jerkiness) in an output animation.


 However, the learned force field priors can only predict resultant forces of join torques and contact forces, the optimization problem is high-dimensional and highly nonlinear; it might be subject to local minima, the optimization problem is high-dimensional and highly nonlinear; it might be subject to local minima.Another limitation of our system is that it cannot generate a motion that is very different from motion examples because our approach is data-driven.
