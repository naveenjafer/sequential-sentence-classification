The objective of this paper is to design an animation system that allows users to easily create natural-looking character animation by specifying spatial-temporal constraints throughout the motion. An approach was presented for generating both full-body movement and facial expression from spatial-temporal constraints while matching the statistical properties of a database of captured motion. The system automatically learns a low-dimensional linear dynamic model from motion capture data and then enforces this as spatial-temporal priors to generate the motion. The statistical dynamic equations, together with an automatically derived objective function and user-defined constraints, comprise a trajectory optimization problem. Solving this optimization problem in the lowdimensional space yields optimal, natural motion that achieves the goals specified by the user. The system achieves a degree of generality beyond the motion capture data.
