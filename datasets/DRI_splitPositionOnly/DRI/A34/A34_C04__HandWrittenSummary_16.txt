Collision handling in Computer Graphics has two phases. One is to detect collisions and the other is to resolve collisions. In this paper a new collision resolution scheme for cloth collisions is presented. Cloth-cloth collision resolution is a special case of deformable N-body collision resolution. To solve deformable N-body collision resolutions, it has been proposed a new collision resolution method which gives a visually reasonable response by ensuring the conservation of N-body momentums. 
First the colliding particles are divided into parts and build a system of linear equations based on the collision relationships between these parts. Then the whole system uses the law of N-body momentum conservation. The system of equalities is based on the scheme adapted from the simultaneous resolution method for rigid N-body collisions proposed by Baraff. The advantage of this approach is the synthesis of realistic cloth interactions.
