Collision handling in computer graphics involves detection and resolution. The task of detection is computationally intensive due to number of particles involved and therefore many work sought to expedite the detection process. The main task of collision resolution is to find the correct next position of the colliding objects. Cloth-cloth collision is a special case of deformable N-body collision resolution. Several works have been carried out so far which exploits non-penetrating positions, velocities and acceleration with certain limitations. One such work resolves collision by giving an average velocity to all the particles of the collision. Though it is easy to implement but it cannot give proper visual effect due to lack of dynamic interaction between particles after particles collide into each other. The authors of this paper extended the above work and overcome the limitation by conserving the N-body momentums. The new collision resolution method uses modified swept volume for collision detection and saves the information as a set of Impact Zone (IZ). Later, this information was used for collision resolution. The authors have designed efficient collision resolution method for single, double as well as multiple simultaneous collisions. The results presents the proposed methods can make significant improvement in visual perception while maintaining the computational intensity within acceptable limit.
