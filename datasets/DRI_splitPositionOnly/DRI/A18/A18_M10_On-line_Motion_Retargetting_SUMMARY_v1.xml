        <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="2.33">This paper presented the on-line motion retargetting technique based on inverse rate control.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="4.33">The method is an improvement over the off-line retargetting based on spacetime constraints since real-time performances can be retargetted without degradation of retargetting quality.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="4.33">The OMR technique greatly helps to get more satisfactory results in motion capturing with fewer trials by giving the real-time feedback to the performer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="3.67">Furthermore, the captured data are enhanced in both end-effector positions and joint angles by going through our OMR filter.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="4.33">One minor unsolved problem is that there is no easy way to guarantee full-proof stability of the system due to the non-linearity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="3.00">We observed that at a very low sampling rate, and if the model goes near the kinematic singularity and thus very little manipulative redundancy is left, then the system can became unstable.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="2.00">However, experiments proved that the system never become unstable at 30Hz or higher sampling rate.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="1.67">If the source motion is available only at a low sampling rate, two remedies are recommended: <CitSpan>( 1 )</CitSpan> by interpolating the source motion curves, first produce more samples, and then use them as the input to the OMR filter, or <CitSpan>( 2 )</CitSpan> scale down the end-effector trajectory to avoid the singular configuration, or use both of <CitSpan>( 1 ) and ( 2 )</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="1.67">The above remedies are for an excessively bad situation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="3.67">Our on-line motion retargetting produces satisfactory results in retargetting most human or creature motion.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" summaryRelevanceScore="2.33">If the technique is well utilized, it can be very useful to people in character animation and game industries.</Sentence>
