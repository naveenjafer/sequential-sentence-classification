In this paper the author captures the motion of cloth using multiple synchronized video cameras and specially tailored landmarks which are placed on a 3D cloth surface. Then the system reconstructs the 3D location of surface points by detecting the landmarks in multiple views. The output is a sequence of triangle meshes with static connectivity and landmarks in both smooth and folded areas. In case of heavily folded surface, contiguous visible regions are often small and oddly shaped. By capturing more information per pixel this correspondence problem of these regions is solved. The pattern printed on the surface of the cloth is improved such as the methods to match the captured regions. The pixel information at a first stage derive from the neighbour areas and at the final correspondence stage from a driven hole-filling technique. The main target of this acquisition pipeline is to compute correspondence using minimal neighbourhoodsâ€™ information. At the end of the process the result is finalised by a smoothing tool similar to anisotropic diffusion.
