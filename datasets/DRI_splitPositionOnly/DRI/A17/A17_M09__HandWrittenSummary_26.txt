In this paper the authors present a novel method for creating realistic, controllable motion through a database of motion capture. They present a method for synthesizing streams of motions based on a corpus of captured movement while preserving the quality of the original data. Given a set of motion capture data, they compile a structure called a motion graph that encodes how the captured clips may be re-assembled in different ways. The motion graph is a directed graph wherein edges contain either pieces of original motion data or automatically generated transitions. The nodes then serve as choice points where these small bits of motion join seamlessly. Because their methods automatically detect and create transitions between motions, users neednâ€™t capture motions specifically designed to connect to one another.

The authors have applied their framework to the problem of path synthesis, including Interactive Control, High-Level Keyframing, Motion Dumping and Crowds. The principle computational bottleneck in graph construction is locating candidate transitions (Section 3.1). The number of edges leaving a node in general grows with the size of the graph, meaning the branching factor in our search algorithm may grow as well. One limitation of their approach is that the transition thresholds must be specified by hand, since different kinds of motions have different fidelity requirements.
