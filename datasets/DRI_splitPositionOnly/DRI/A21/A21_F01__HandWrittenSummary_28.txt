The technique we present builds on prior grid-based, Eulerian methods for animating incompressible fluids with free surfaces. Our method computes viscoelastic fluid behavior by supplementing the basic Navier-Stokes equations with additional terms for elastic body forces. Behavior of the viscoelastic fluid is governed by a modified version of the Navier-Stokes equations that includes an additional term for elastic stress. We use a semi-Lagrangian method to advect field values. We use a level-set grid with twice the fluid gridâ€™s resolution, and that is staggered with respect to the fluid grid. This scheme places level-set grid centers on the cell centers, face centers, edge centers, and nodes of the fluid grid.

Some of our examples suffer from noticeable volume loss. When the surfaces begin to interact through shared ghost cells, error occurs. We are using an explicit integration method for the viscous and elastic forces, so very high viscous or elastic coefficients would probably cause stability problems and force smaller time steps.

To a large extent, our method for incorporating elastoplastic terms does not depend on the underlying fluid simulation method, and one could easily adapt the method to other fluid simulation techniques such as smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. Furthermore, we found that once we already had a working fluid simulation, adding the elastoplastic terms was fairly easy. Finally, we note that while the method we present can model a wide range of phenomena, many real materials can demonstrate behaviors not captured by this model.
