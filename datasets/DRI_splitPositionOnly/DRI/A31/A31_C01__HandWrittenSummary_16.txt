The author presented a data-driven method for simulating clothes worn by 3D characters in real-time. In order to achieve a real-time performance in simulating cloth a number of previous work strategies have been analysed providing their advantages and limitations. Based on those approaches the author effectively optimized the physics-based deformation, which is the bottleneck of the simulation, by using a coarse representation of the cloth mesh to drive the gross behaviour in simulation. In more details the gross cloth behaviour is driven mainly by two separable contributions: the skeleton-driven movement of the character and the mechanical properties of the cloth. In order to achieve more efficient and realistic results this approach was focused on the analysis of cloth movements in relation to its associated skin surface, and adopting a learning strategy.
Therefore the process was divided into three steps. First, a novel collision detection prunes out unnecessary collision tests by tightly localizing potentially colliding regions through the analysis of the cloth movement in relation to the skeleton. Second, the pre-simulated sequence to approximate the dynamic behaviour of the coarse mesh geometrically wherever possible was used. Finally, fine details such as wrinkles were also simulated in a data-driven manner, by using the pre-simulated cloth sequence as examples. 
Based on the presented results, the simulator performs realistic examples for clothes with some limitation on tight ones due to approximate handling of collision detection.
