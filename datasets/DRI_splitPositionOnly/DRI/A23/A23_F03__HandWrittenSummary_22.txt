Computer graphics simulations of fluid behavior are in demand in filmmaking for depicting gases, liquids, smoke, dust, fire, and other natural phenomena. This paper describes a system built at DreamWorks to support the use of fluid dynamics simulations in the creation of special effects for the animated feature film The Prince of Egypt. This system enables animators to access the beauty and realism embodied in the physically accurate equations of motion, the Navier-Stokes equations. Animators can express themselves by controlling the simulation dynamics through a familiar user interface.

The unique features of the system include: a compressible version of the equations of motion; the use of images and animations for controlling the dynamics; fast accurate texture mapping features; and a complete production system. The compressible formulation allows for the modelling of compressible effects and also provides a mechanism for speeding up flow calculations by an order of magnitude or more. The use of images and animations as input devices allows animators to control initial conditions, source terms, and movable internal boundaries in an easy and flexible way. The inclusion of texture mapping differential equations makes it possible to precalculate particle paths on a fixed grid which can be used in a straight-forward manner at render time. The system also provides fast turn around time. The use of two-dimensional simulations, the compressible formulation, and coarser grids, results in fast, useful simulations. Additional production components make the overall process efficient for the animator.
