        <H1>Introduction</H1>
      
      <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Skin deformation resulting from the movement of characters, such as humans and animals, is one of the most interesting and challenging topics in computer animation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">The modelling and deformation of such characters are inevitably complicated and timeconsuming, because of their structural complexity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">While realism is important, other factors such as intuitiveness, ease of interaction and computational cost are also of great importance in animation production.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">Often a compromise among these factors has to be reached.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">There are two general categories of methods in animation practice: simulation and authoring.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Simulation 1–3 refers to the use of a mathematical model to automatically recreate the physical reality on computers.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">A simulation method lets the animator easily create certain effect which could be otherwise almost an impossible mission with manual manipulations.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">However, the disadvantage is also obvious.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Although the simulation techniques provide some parameters for the animator to control the animation, the connection between these parameters and the result is often implicit.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">It is usually difficult for an artist to understand the exact physical meaning of these parameters and connect them to the final outcome.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Second, such methods are often computationally expensive.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The authoring methods refer to those that the animator can use to manipulate the modelling or deformation directly.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The animator is able to see the result immediately and has a full control over the deformed shape of the character in question.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Both types of methods were around for a long time.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">However, animators turn to favour those tools that they feel they have a control and can evaluate the results directly.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">In this paper we present a new skinning technique for the deformation of computer-animated characters.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">A key advantage is that it combines the strengths of both prevalent categories discussed above.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This technique is based on a physically inspired deformation model from structural engineering, known as the bar-networks (bar-nets) and can therefore deform realistically based on the physical properties leading to physically plausible outcomes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Meanwhile, instead of letting the mechanical model taking its full course, the animator is able to operate it as a physically based authoring tool in the same way as other conventional deformation tools.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">We call this technique the bar-net driven deformations.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In animation practice, either for the film industry or games design, it is quite often for each character model to have two layers of mesh, a rough mesh (low resolution) and a fine mesh (high resolution).</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The high-resolution (high-res) mesh may take various forms, such as Nurbs, subdivision surfaces and polygon meshes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The detailed skin shapes including skin deformations, wrinkle, squama and feather are created on this layer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Because the mesh is very dense involving fine detail, it is inefficient to animate directly on this layer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The low-resolution (low-res) mesh thus works as an efficient intermediate layer for the modelling and deformation of the fine skin layer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Our technique adopts this two-layered strategy.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The animator creates almost all skin deformation effects on the low-res layer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In order to take advantage of the physics, we couple an aforementioned mechanical bar-net with the low-res mesh in areas where deformations are expected to occur.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This low-res layer gets deformed physically and in turn deforms the high-res mesh of the character’s skin model.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In order for a mechanical network to be useful in skin deformation for animated characters, we devise a set of properties for the network to satisfy.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">These properties allow the behaviours of skin and anatomic tissues, e.g. muscle groups, to be mimicked intuitively in computer animation and to be computed rapidly.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">What needs pointing out is although there is a similarity between a bar-net and a mass–spring model, they have substantially different behaviours.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">A mass–spring model will not be able to satisfy the properties we define here.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">This paper is organized as follows.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The next section provides a brief survey of the previous related work.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The following section outlines the procedure of creating an animated character model with the coupled bar-nets.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The section ‘Bar-net Definition and Form Finding’ discusses the properties an ideal bar-net should have together with a form finding method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Using a human arm model as an example, the section ‘Deformation for Character Animation’ describes how our deformation technique can be used to deform skin surfaces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The last section concludes our work.</Sentence>

        <H1>Background and Related Work</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Most of the techniques on character deformation can be roughly categorized into two groups: authoring and simulation methods, although the boundary between them does not always seem clear.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">What’s follows is a brief review of some relevant previous work.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The technique of Free Form Deformations (FFDs) first introduced by Sederberg and Parry 4 remains popular and has been adopted by many animation software packages due to its simplicity and modelling speed.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">FFDs were later extended by several other researchers.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">5–8 All these techniques are purely geometric in nature and make no attempt to simulate the physical properties or behaviours of a character.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Based on the FFDs, two very popular deformation tools were developed in Maya, the Lattice and Wrap deformers.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">An intuitive attempt to deform a character was involving a skeleton into skin deformation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">This approach has a long history and it treats the skin as a shell that moves by an explicit function of the skeleton.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Vertices of the skin are deformed by a weighted combination of the joint transformations of the character’s skeleton.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">9–13 Collectively, such methods are known as the smooth skinning.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">They are easy to understand and intuitive to use.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">A tedious part is the proper assignment of the weights.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In production, the weights are painted by the animator, and thus the animator has full control over the outcomes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The smooth skinning approach suffers from some notorious drawbacks, called the candy wrapper effect or collapsing elbow effect, due to its lack of consideration of volume preservation for the soft tissues.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The example-based methods were developed as an alternative in order to overcome this kind of problems 14–17 and have had some success.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">With this method, which is called Blend Shape in animation production, the animator can control the exact appearance of the character.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In facial animation, for example, the animator often needs to dictate how a facial model deforms to achieve different expressions.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">On the downside, however, a large number of models have to be made in the pose space and stored for shape interpolation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">This is an expensive process.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The drive for realism in computer graphics has lead to some new modelling and deformation techniques.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">A group of techniques that have gained increasing popularity in the computer animation of characters are those based on characters anatomy.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">These models attempt to mimic their real life counterparts by reproducing their anatomical structures.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">These anatomy-based skinning methods differ on the complexity of the models and their behaviours of the underlying anatomical structures.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Some use simple muscle shapes, such as abstract muscle operators, 18 meatballs, 19 some employ detailed models.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">20–23 The obvious advantage of this group of methods is its ability in achieving detailed visual quality during animation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">One of the difficulties of these techniques, 24–28 however, is that they are indirect to use, as one has to model the anatomical structures before its appearance arrives.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Achieving a particular look of the skin requires the determination of the shape, number and the layout of the muscles underneath.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Until the skin mesh envelops the underlying structure, it is very hard to anticipate how the character looks like from the outside.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">To retain the advantage of the anatomy-based technique without losing intuitiveness, recent research has looked into the issue of estimating the muscles from the skin shape.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">29–30 This new technique has had a degree of success.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The current limitations are that they could only use simple muscle shapes, which are sufficient in obtaining detailed deformations.</Sentence>

        <H1>The Proposed Model</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Anatomy based multi-layered models have significantly improved the realism of the modelling of complex living creatures.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">Character animation based on the deformation of underlying anatomical structures, such as muscles or fat, is a very complicated process.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">Issues like mechanical forces, material properties and collision among anatomic structures all need to be properly addressed.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">The computational cost is inevitably excessive.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">Such computational costs place severe restrictions on many applications.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge_Goal">Our bar-net driven skinning method endeavours to take advantage of the anatomy-based approach, the smooth skinning approach and the physically based approach.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Figure 1 shows a simple flowchart of this method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">It follows the current animation workflow, except that a bar-net is coupled with the low-res skin layer.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">When the low-res mesh (or a part of it) is coupled with a bar-net, the couple mesh is called the control mesh in this paper.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Bar-nets deform according to both the external forces it is subject to and the stiffness properties of the network.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">By controlling these two factors, the animator can easily create the various skin deformation effects including muscle bulge, wrinkles and creases easily.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">Our system consists of three layers: The skeleton layer controls the movement of the character and determines the basic shape of its body.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The control mesh is bound to the character skeleton in the same way as the traditional smooth skinning method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The bar-nets work like a deformer (a term used in many animation packages, e.g. Maya) to change the shape of the skin surface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">It is compatible with all the other deformation tools incorporated in current animation software.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">They can accumulatively deform the skin shape in a certain order which can be easily changed by the animator on the fly.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The fine mesh, either in the form of Nurbs, subdivision surfaces or polygons, is deformed by the control mesh using the wrapping deformation method 8 which is available with many commercial animation packages.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Further detailed deformations including wrinkle can also be added on either by manipulating the skin surface directly or by coupling a bar-net with the fine mesh using the same mechanism.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A bar-net connects n s points, P i , in three-dimensional space with straight-line segments, called bars.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">These points on the net are known as nodes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The nodes can be either fixed or free.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Fixed nodes will not have their positions changed regardless of whether they are subjected to external forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Free nodes can be moved to balance the acting forces on the net.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Each bar connects two nodes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">These bars can be stretched and squashed resulting from the positioning of the end nodes, but they cannot be bent.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The network described above is in fact a graph with links connecting pairs of nodes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A matrix C s , called the branch–node matrix can be formed, which represents in a tabular form the graph of the network.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Assuming that there are n free nodes and n f fixed nodes, the branch–node matrix can be further subdivided into two sub-matrices, C and C f , by grouping the free-node columns and fixed-node columns of the original matrix, respectively.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">These matrices are used in computing the rest shape of a bar-net.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A deformable part of the low-res mesh of a character can be considered as a bar-net.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This analogy establishes a natural link between a mechanical bar-net and a surface patch.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">If a bar-net is coupled with a surface, the surface can be made to behave like a piece of elastic material.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Thus many numerical methods developed in structural and mechanical engineering for the manipulation of structures and networks can be applied to control the deformation of the surfaces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Deforming the bar-net deforms the coupled surface, hence the name bar-net driven deformation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Bar-nets can have any arbitrary topology.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">They are not restricted to a quadrilateral topology unlike most curved surface patches.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Quadrilateral patches are the easiest to control and there have been many algorithms developed to implement them.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">But methods for controlling the deformation of a non-quadrilateral surface patch analytically remain an interesting research topic.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Such a problem could be resolved by coupling a general mechanical bar-net with the control points of a surface patch of the same topology.</Sentence>

        <H1>Bar-Net Def|nition and Form Finding</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The principle idea of the proposed bar-net driven deformation technique is to regard the deformable area of an animated creature as a network, which deforms under an acting force.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The final shape of the surface represents the rest shape of the network and is the result of the balance of all external and internal forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">To make it useful and intuitive for the animator, we define a number of properties essential for such a bar-net to satisfy: The network deformation is determined only by the topology, the stiffness parameter and the loading (force) of the network, but is independent of the geometry.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">One does not need to worry about the shape of the network itself.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This because we use a bar-net only as a control mechanism.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Changing the stiffness with other parameters unchanged has an influence on the whole network.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This is in line with the physical property of human tissues and therefore makes physical sense.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The x, y, z components of the external loads applied to the free nodes (non-fixed nodes) have independent influences on the deformation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The x component of the displacement is only determined by the x component of the applied force, and similarly for the y and z components.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">So when the animator wishes to finetune the effects on the x, y or z direction separately, the surface will deform as expected.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The deformation of the free nodes satisfies the superposition principle.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In other words, if one free node is subject to the influence of a number of forces simultaneously, the general deformation applied to the node is the same as the sum of all the deformations generated by applying these loads independently.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The benefit from this property is that several muscles, bones, fat tissues can affect the skin deformation simultaneously through summing up of their individual forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Network form finding is always a numerically complicated problem in mechanical and structural engineering.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Various numerical methods exist.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">As far as most mechanical networks are concerned, the relationship between the equilibrium state and the acting forces is non-linear.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Shape change cannot be trivially related to the magnitude and direction of the external forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Often numerical algorithms are deployed to determine the rest form of a network, which is inevitably time-consuming and not very useful for animation production.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In our case, the effect of stiffness of a network can be approximated by the quantity of force-length ratios of all the bars.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Some researchers call this quantity the force density.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Using this stiffness parameter, we found the force density method 31 satisfies the above-defined properties.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">y An added advantage is that it is also able to solve the

        <H1>Conclusions and Future Work</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Character deformation in computer animation has attracted a great deal of research effort over the last two decades.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The earlier models, despite being cheap, had difficulties in creating realistic character deformations.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">With the quest for realism, more physically based and CPU intensive computation models have emerged, notably the multi-layered anatomy-based approach.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">However, in addition to the computational cost, it is undesirable to require the animator to model many muscles before the skin shape is developed.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">In this paper, we propose a physically motivated deformation authoring technique, called the bar-net driven skinning.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Its main strength lies in the combination of speed, intuitiveness and good realism.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">Our technique can achieve similar results to those of the anatomy-based techniques, but in an interactive manner.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Bar-nets reach their rest shape when the acted forces equilibrate.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Changing the forces and/or stiffness leads to a change of their shape.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Coupling a part of surface mesh with bar-nets allows the surface deformation to be controlled by manipulating the networks and can take advantage of the physical behaviour inherent to the network.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In order to allow deformations to be produced quickly and intuitively, we have devised a set of properties that an ‘ideal’ bar-net should satisfy, which make intuitive shape control and fast computation possible.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">To deform the skin surface of a character, we couple a bar-net with a low-res mesh, called the control mesh, which links with the skin surface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This makes the skin mechanically deformable and achieves realistic deformation outcomes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">We provide two types of user-handles associated with a bar-net, the virtual forces applied to the free nodes of a network and the force density values.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">They can be used individually as an interactive modelling tool or collectively to mimic the muscle forces from a muscle group.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">We have implemented this technique into prototype program in a form of a plug-in for the Autodesk Maya software ( Figure 7 ).</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">It provides the animator with a new deformer which can be used both as a modelling and an animation tool.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The animator can interactively change the fix–free status of each node, define and manipulate the forces on each free node, tune the force densities for selected bars.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">On the downside, the tools developed so far are still relatively primitive.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The user needs to understand the basic principles of the bar-net properties before the technique can be used efficiently.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_FutureWork">To remedy this problem we are currently designing higher-level tools with an interactive user interface, which will hide this complexity from the user.</Sentence>
