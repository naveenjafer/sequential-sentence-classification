The correct choice of the simulation method and its implementation is a very important issue in the design of an efficient cloth simulation system. Among the available methods, there are finite elements methods, continuum mechanics or particle systems. This paper provides a quantitative comparison of the efficiency of the most common integration techniques in terms of speed and accuracy which are used for cloth simulation, and raises the key considerations for optimal implementations depending on the practical kind of simulation problematic. 
Fistly, a particle system represents the mechanical system as a set of punctual masses. Secondly, the cloth surface shape is represented by the geometry between neighboring particles. Thirdly, the mechanical behavior is represented as interaction forces between the particles, which depend on the relative position and speed of the particles, measuring deformation and deformation speed. The methods which are under consideration are the Runge-Kutta and the Backward Euler.
