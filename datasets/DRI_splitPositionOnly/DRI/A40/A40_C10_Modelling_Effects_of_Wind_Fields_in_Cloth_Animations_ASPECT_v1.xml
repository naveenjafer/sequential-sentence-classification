        <H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
      
      <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">While the simulation of wind is an area of vast interest in aerodynamic engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and animation/visualisation of fluids in computer graphics, it has been a rather abandoned subject in simulation of deformable objects such as cloth simulation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This is mostly due to the fact that conventional CFD applications require enormous computational power.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">However, aerodynamic effects are obviously capable of enhancing the realism of an animated scene and thus are an important part of a cloth simulation system.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">For example, air resistance is a vital component which cannot be neglected if realistic animation is desired [ BTH + 03 ].</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In this work we discuss two different approaches to
      model force fields describing air motion and show how these forces can be applied to generate aerodynamic effects on textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The first method is based on modelling air flows with the Navier-Stokes equations.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">With this model, the effect of wind fields on smoke has already been investigated <CitSpan>[FSJ01]</CitSpan>, and in this paper we extend this approach to wind effects on textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">However, the solution of the sophisticated NavierStokes equations is not desired and not necessary in all situations where wind effects shall be integrated into cloth simulations.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">For this case, we present a much simpler model based on tracing wind particles that move along a global force field.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">During the simulation, the wind field is evaluated for each wind particle at its current position.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The so determined flow field is used to compute the wind force which is added to the forces that act on the textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">By detecting collisions between the wind particles and objects in the scene, we are able to simulate the important effect of lee even with this straightforward method.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Of course, both approaches have different characteristics and aim at different applications for wind simulation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In this work, we compare the models’ advantages and disadvantages and show practical results of the described methods.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The rest of this paper is organized as follows.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">After giving an overview of related work in section 2, we describe the aerodynamic force model applied in this work in section 3.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In section 4 we discuss the two wind field models, namely the one based on the Navier-Stokes equations in 4.1, and the one based on tracing wind particles in 4.2.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Finally, we show some practical results of the implemented algorithms in section 5, before we conclude the paper in section 6.</Sentence>

        <H1>WIND FIELD MODELS</H1>
        <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In this section we describe two different wind field models and show how they can be used to model wind effects on textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The first model is based on the work of Stam <CitSpan>[Sta97]</CitSpan> and calculates the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation with a semi-Lagrangian approach.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This model is extended to interaction of the wind flow with textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The second model employs precomputed wind flows and particle tracing methods.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This approach is much easier to implement and can be added to existing simulation modules without additional computational cost.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In section 4.2, we show how to produce realistic effects of wind on textiles including lee effects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">4.1 The Navier-Stokes equations The Navier-Stokes equations describe a precise mathematical model for fluid flows.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">The numerical algorithms used in CFD to solve these equations are designed for physical accuracy for engineering applications and are expensive in computation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">But in our case where this precision is not necessary simplifications can be made which greatly reduce the computation costs as described by Stam <CitSpan>[Sta03]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Since the arising wind velocities are clearly below the speed of sound, compressibility effects are negligible, and the wind is modelled as an incompressible constant density fluid.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This notably simplifies the numerical approximation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be written in a compact vector notation as</Sentence>
        
          4.1
          ∇ · u = 0,
        
        
          4.2
          ∂u = −(u · ∇)u − 1 ∇p + ν∇ 2 u + f . ∂t ρ
        
        <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Here, u describes the (three-dimensional) velocity field, ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, ρ its density, p the pressure in the wind field, and f accounts for external forces.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The first equation states that the velocity field should be incompressible while the second one describes the evolution of a velocity field over time.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The first term on the right hand side reflects the change of velocity due to advection, while the second expression accounts for any external force f and acceleration caused by the local pressure gradient ∇p and by viscous drag depending on ν.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In the following we briefly describe the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations (4.1) and (4.2) by Stam <CitSpan>[Sta97]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To solve these equations numerically they first have to be discretised.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">For this, the computational domain is diced up into equally sized cubes forming a grid as described in section 4.2.2, and sample values of velocity and pressure are defined at the cell centres.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Foster and Metaxas <CitSpan>[FM96]</CitSpan> use a finite difference approximation for the discretisation of the operators in equation (4.2).</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Then they update the cell’s velocities according to the divergence value computed in each direction, respectively, using an explicit integration scheme.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Since time steps in explicit computations usually need to be very small, we follow Stam <CitSpan>[Sta99]</CitSpan> who proposes an implicit integration scheme, which allows stable simulations with large time steps.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">While the linear terms in equation (4.2) are straightforward to solve implicitly, the term −(u · ∇)u is nonlinear and deserves special attention.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Here, a different approach based on the method of characteristics is used to solve the advection equation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Equation (4.2) does not provide a divergent-free velocity field.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Therefore, the divergence of each cell in the grid has to be projected to zero using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition <CitSpan>[Sta03]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">The major advantage of Navier-Stokes based approaches consists in the fact that the evolution of the wind flow over time is calculated.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">It enables us to model global effects like convection and diffusion on a physical basis.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NOVELTY" inAbstract="false">We present a model to exploit these wind models for calculating the interaction of deformable objects with the air flow by a boundary condition method.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">As already stated by Stam <CitSpan>[Sta03]</CitSpan> “a velocity field of its own isn’t really visually interesting until it starts moving objects [...</Sentence>]”. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">That means in particular that all objects in the scene interact with the fluid present in it, i.e. in our case clothes with the wind.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">On the one hand the wind deforms the objects which on the other hand change the wind flow.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To describe the above situation by a physical model we require the Neumann boundary condition ∂u =0 ∂n to be satisfied for the wind flow u at any boundary point of an object with normal n.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Rigid objects like walls will influence the fluid field but will not be affected by fluid forces themselves.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Deformable objects like cloth are supposed to both experience fluid forces and itself influence the fluid flow.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This in fact is a major difficulty.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Consider a point p b on the boundary of a deformable object in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Let u(p b ) be the corresponding wind velocity at that point and n be its normal.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">On the one hand, we want the Neumann boundary condition u(p b ) · n = 0 to be satisfied.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">On the other hand, the wind velocity orthogonal to the object’s surface is just what causes the aerodynamic forces.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Without further remedial action setting the boundary according to the Neumann condition would mean that the fluid will not exert forces on the objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Here we propose a method which meets both requirements.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">For every deformable object the velocity value of the surrounding wind field for every vertex of the representing mesh is tracked.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In the solver’s cycle, the boundary conditions are then set prior to any other operation: For every object in the scene each triangle of its representing mesh is registered in the fluid grid, which means that the cell of the wind field occupied by the object is marked as occupied.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The wind velocity at the vertex positions of the object is recorded.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Additionally, the normals of these vertices are stored.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Then, the aerodynamic forces as described in section 3 are calculated.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Finally, for every marked cell in the scene the previously stored normals are averaged in one space cell which are used to update the velocity at the cell to satisfy the Neumann boundary condition.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Thus, the boundary conditions are met and yet aerodynamic forces are obtained.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">A different issue is how to deal with the inside of (rigid) objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The method to set boundary conditions as described above does not account for the interior of objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Thus, a nonzero velocity could be mistakenly assigned to cells lying inside an object.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To avoid this situation, the path of the wind flow is checked for object intersection, whereby the collision detection of the cloth simulation system provides a simple method to deal with this issue <CitSpan>[MKE03]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">4.2 Particle Tracing on Wind Fields Here we combine the idea of creating wind fields by predefined flow primitives with particle tracing in given flow fields.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To define a wind scene we first built up the air flow by simple primitives such as parallel directed wind fields, vortices, etc.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">We then use a par- ticle tracing method in the defined wind field to determine the effect of lee by detecting windless areas.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">This method is very easy to implement and yields very plausible and nicely looking results.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">A simple approach to generate complex air flows is to define a wind field by mathematical functions which assign to each point in space a unique velocity value.</Sentence> As Wejchert et al. <CitSpan>[WH91]</CitSpan> have shown, this already enables an animator to design even complex wind fields: Assuming an irrotational (∇ × u = 0), inviscid, and incompressible (∇ · u = 0) fluid, the NavierStokes equations which describe the mechanics of any fluid (see section 4.1) can be simplified to give the Laplace equation
        4.1.1 The solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
        4.1.2 Wind effects on clothes
        4.2.1 Global Wind Fields
        
          4.3
          ∇ · u = ∇∇φ = ∇ 2 φ = 0,
        
        <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">where φ is the potential of the given wind field.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Thus, the velocity field u is given by The linearity of equation (4.3) enables an animator to combine basic flows which satisfy equation (4.3) as he likes and thus to obtain complex fluid flows.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Some primitives common to fluid simulations are depicted in figure 2 .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">One drawback of this model is that it cannot handle objects exhibiting complex boundaries.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The approach to model solid objects in the scene taken by Wejchert et al. consists in placing a wind source using a mirror principle in order to extinguish the air flow at the boundary of the object.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE_DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">While this works for simple objects this approach is not feasible at all with deformable objects like textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Another more serious drawback of this model for our application consists in the lack of interaction with objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">The wind flow defined by the primitives will not react on objects in the scene which means for example that tissues in the lee of other objects will be affected by the wind flow as well.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">However, this method can be combined with the aerodynamic model described in section 3 to give nice and fast results as will be shown in section 5.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">To solve the described problems we propose a model which combines the simple global wind flow techniques with a particle tracing method.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Here, particles are moved along the wind field to determine the effect of objects in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This model divides the scene into parallelepiped cells.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">There are two common approaches to discretising the continuous velocity field defined in space: one can either choose the midpoint of a cell <CitSpan>[Sta99]</CitSpan> or its six faces <CitSpan>[FM96]</CitSpan> to define the field.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">As usual, values between the defining points of the grid are interpolated using trilinear functions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The basic idea of the particle tracing method is to trace wind particles through a field w = i w i defined by linear superposition of wind sources corresponding to flow primitives with respective velocity fields w i .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The field w does not account for lee effects caused by objects in the flow.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Therefore we compute the wind field u containing these effects as follows.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In our model every wind source is also a particle source: These particles form an uncoupled particle system which can be considered as a wind gust.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The wind particles are emitted into the velocity field w i of the corresponding wind source which is defined on a grid.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The specific emission intervals and amounts depend on the properties of the flow sources.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In every time step each particle in a wind gust moves along its velocity field w i defined by the corresponding wind source.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Notice that the movement of the particles in a wind gust is only affected by the wind source they belong to.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The global superposition of all wind sources has no effect on these particles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To calculate the wind particles’ positions we used the explicit Euler integration scheme.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">For a wind particle at position p t and time t this results in a path s(p t , p t+∆t ), where p t+∆t denotes the position after time step ∆t according to p t+∆t = p t + w i (p t , ∆t) .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">As a particle moves along its path in space, all grid cells colliding with the path are updated with the velocity of the associated wind source with respect to the position of the particle.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The particle might cross several grid cells on its way during a single time step.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">If this is the case, the path of the particle has to be subdivided into parts not exceeding the size of a grid cell.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This path is then tested for collisions with the objects in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The velocity field u is then computed as for each grid cell separately, where w i are all those wind sources whose particles have reached the cell.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">If a collision is detected at position p col the normal of the colliding object n obj (p col ) is determined and the velocity of the particle is set to w i (p col , t+∆t) = w i (p col , t)−(n obj ·w i (p col , t))·n obj This assures that the velocity component of the resulting field u is orthogonal to the collision object’s surface at p col is zero, i.e. u(p col , t + ∆t) · n obj = 0 , and thus no flow propagates through the object.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The wind force effective on objects in the scene is then computed from the velocity field u.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Since u is determined using the wind particles, every point p that could not be reached by any wind particle will hold zero velocity even if w may hold a nonzero velocity.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Thus, this method solves the problems described in section 4.2.1.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Note that the somewhat tempting simplification of tagging each cell to either have wind in it or not is not valid.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Imagine the simple scene in which there are two directional wind sources with opposite wind directions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Let them further have equal velocity magnitude and no distance attenuation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">If we now place a solid object in between these two sources a rather undesired effect would occur using this simplification: on both sides of the solid object all cells would be tagged as having wind.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">But evaluating the wind field at every cell we would obtain a zero velocity.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This is due to the extinguishing effect of the superposition of the two wind sources.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Therefore, it is crucial for the particles to have the associated velocity of their wind source and not just the velocity resulting from the global superposition of all wind sources.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">4.3 Comparison In this section we comment on the different models described in this paper.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">For physically accurate simulations based on the common method in fluid dynamics the model introduced by Stam produces realistic effects which global wind field models can never achieve.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">It produces nice swirls and vortices derived from dynamical characteristics of the fluid.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE"

        <H1>CONCLUSIONS</H1>
        <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">We presented two models for including advanced wind effects into cloth simulation systems.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The first concentrates on physically accurate computations using a semi-Lagrangian approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the second model incorporates a particle tracing method for global wind fields.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">As illustrated in the previous section both methods produce realistic looking results which are capable of enhancing the realism of computer animations.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">While the first model has a wider range of applications, the second one provides an easy method which still delivers realistic effects such as air resistance and lee.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">All methods described in this work should be easy to extend to three-dimensional deformable objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">All the methods apply the same except for simple changes.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Since three-dimensional objects define an inner and outer part, the adaption of the face normals in equation (3.1) is not necessary.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Moreover, in the wind field computation care has to be taken that no wind field is present in the object.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Here, the same method as described for rigid objects (section 4.2.2) can be applied.</Sentence>

To show the improved realism when simulating lee effects, we let the the wind act on all polygons of the shirt on the right (no lee effect). For the shirt on the left we used the particle tracing method to simulate lee effects which gives more realistic results.
