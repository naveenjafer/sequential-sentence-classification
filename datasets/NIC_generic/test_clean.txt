Background	Heart rate variability ( HRV ) as an indirect autonomic assessment provides prognostic information when measured over short time periods in patients with heart failure .
Background	Long-term continuous HRV can be measured from an implantable device , but the clinical value of these measurements is unknown .
Method	A total of 397 patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure were studied .
Result	Of these , 370 patients had information from their implanted cardiac resynchronization device for mortality risk stratification , and 288 patients had information for measured parameters ( ie , HRV , night heart rate , and patient activity ) and clinical event a
Result	Continuous HRV was measured as the standard deviation of 5-minute median atrial-atrial intervals ( SDAAM ) sensed by the device .
Result	SDAAM < 50 ms when averaged over 4 weeks was associated with increased mortality risk ( hazard ratio 3.20 , P = 0.02 ) and SDAAM were persistently lower over the entire follow-up period in patients who required hospitalization or died .
Result	SDAAM decreased a median of 16 days before hospitalization and returned to baseline after treatment .
Result	Automated detection of decreases in SDAAM was 70 % sensitive in detecting cardiovascular hospitalization , with 2.4 false-positives per patient-year of follow-up .
Result	This study demonstrates that SDAAM continuously measured from an implanted cardiac resynchronization device is lower in patients at high mortality and hospitalization risk .
Result	SDAAM declines as patient status decompensates .
Result	Continuous long-term SDAAM may be a useful tool in the clinical management of patients with chronic heart failure .

Background	Intrathecal baclofen is an invaluable therapeutic modality in the management of severe spasticity , especially in patients with cerebral palsy , multiple sclerosis , and spinal cord and brain injuries .
Background	This case report presents a rare complication of long-term intrathecal infusion with the development of a huge anterior abdominal wall hematoma with extension to the retroperitoneal space as a result of a repeated blunt trauma to the site of the intrathec
Result	This inferior epigastric artery erosion could be avoided by implanting the intrathecal pump laterally away from the rectus abdominus muscle sheath .

Background	Following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , upper motor neuron paralysed muscles lose the normal type I ( slow ) and II ( fast ) fibre mosaic pattern and become predominantly composed of type II ( fast glycolytic ) fibres ) .
Background	The majority of the research demonstrating this fibre type shift was based on pH sensitive myofibrillar ATPase staining techniques on muscle from longstanding paraplegics and quadriplegics .
Background	The purpose of this study was to describe muscle fibre type changes over a wide time spectrum post SCI using immunofluorescent techniques which may be more sensitive to change .
Method	A total of 19 vastus lateralis muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from 12 SCI subjects representing time points of 0.5-219 months post SCI .
Method	Fast and slow myosin heavy chain isoform distribution was determined on single muscle fibres for each of the biopsy specimens .
Result	Early post SCI ( < 1 month ) myosin heavy chain ( MCH ) isoform composition remained relatively stable .
Result	A transitional period was seen between 1 and 20 months post SCI wherein there was a progressive drop in the proportion of slow MHC isoform fibres and a rise in the proportion that co-expressed both the fast and slow MHC isoform .
Result	By approximately 70 months post SCI a new steady state had been reached characterized by almost exclusively fast MHC isoform expression .
Result	This research has demonstrated that post SCI muscle type II transformation occurs in stages and commences earlier than previously appreciated .
Result	Interventions aimed at preventing or minimizing the transformation would need to be instituted within weeks post SCI .

Method	To examine the relation between sleep disturbance and neurocognitive ability among persons with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
Background	Correlational research evaluating demographic and neuropsychological predictors of sleep disturbance using multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance .
Method	Eighty-seven patients with mild to severe TBI admitted to a comprehensive outpatient neurorehabilitation program .
Method	Sleep disturbance assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index .
Result	Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that performance on selected measures of cognitive functioning significantly improved prediction of sleep disturbance , accounting for 14 % of variance beyond that accounted for by injury severity and gender .
Result	The total model accounted for 31 % of the variance in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores .
Result	Patients with mild TBI reported more sleep disturbance ( P < .01 ) than did patients with severe TBI .
Result	Sleep disturbance among patients with TBI may be associated with a particular constellation of neuropsychological abilities .
Result	These issues are discussed in relation to prior findings that indicate the involvement of additional neuropsychiatric factors associated with sleep disturbance in mild TBI .

Background	Functional recovery after large excision of dorsal roots is absent because of both the limited regeneration capacity of the transected root , and the inability of regenerating sensory fibers to traverse the dorsal root entry zone .
Method	In this study , bioresorbable guidance conduits were used to repair 6-mm dorsal root lesion gaps in rats , while neurotrophin-encoding adenoviruses were used to elicit regeneration into the spinal cord .
Method	Polyester conduits with or without microfilament bundles were implanted between the transected ends of lumbar dorsal roots .
Method	Four weeks later , adenoviruses encoding NGF or GFP were injected into the spinal cord along the entry zone of the damaged dorsal roots .
Result	Eight weeks after injury , nerve regeneration was observed through both types of implants , but those containing microfilaments supported more robust regeneration of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) - positive nociceptive axons .
Result	NGF overexpression induced extensive regeneration of CGRP ( + ) fibers into the spinal cord from implants showing nerve repair .
Result	Animals that received conduits containing microfilaments combined with spinal NGF virus injections showed the greatest recovery in nociceptive function , approaching a normal level by 7-8 weeks .
Result	This recovery was reversed by recutting the dorsal root through the centre of the conduit , demonstrating that regeneration through the implant , and not sprouting of intact spinal fibers , restored sensory function .
Result	This study demonstrates that a combination of PNS guidance conduits and CNS neurotrophin therapy can promote regeneration and restoration of sensory function after severe dorsal root injury .

Result	A review of 1300 patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , over a period of 14 years , revealed 12 patients with an ` acute abdomen ' .
Result	Seven events occurred during the initial admission , ranging from 10 days to 9 months from injury , and five during readmission of ` chronic ' SCI patients .
Result	Four were in the acute stage 10-30 days from injury , all with peptic ulcer perforations .
Result	The remainder had either an intestinal obstruction , appendicitis or peritonitis .
Result	All of the neurological levels were above T6 except for one patient who had a low level paraplegia .
Result	The classical signs of an ` acute abdomen ' may be missing in such patients thus delaying diagnosis by 1-4 days .
Result	The most important signs were autonomic dysreflexia , referred shoulder tip pain , abdominal pain , abdominal distension , increased spasticity and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting .
Result	Less importance was given to the classical signs of abdominal tenderness , abdominal muscle rigidity , rebound , fever and of leukocytosis .
Result	Prompt diagnosis and treatment will minimise morbidity and mortality .

Background	To report the ability of 12 tracheostomized acute rehabilitation hospital inpatients with severely disordered consciousness post-traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) to participate in an objective swallowing assessment .
Method	Post hoc analysis of data from a larger , prospective blinded comparison study .
Method	Methods and procedures : Subjects completed a modified barium swallow ( MBS ) study .
Method	Food/drink and tracheostomy tube management recommendations were made .
Result	All subjects participated successfully during an MBS .
Result	Post-MBS , 10 subjects began receiving small amounts of food and/or drink .
Result	Prior to hospital discharge , all subjects received some food and/or drink and were extubated .
Result	Subjects were deemed representative of this patient population and , from a swallowing perspective , other tracheostomized patient populations at the same facility .
Result	Clinicians should routinely consider tracheostomized , acute rehabilitation hospital inpatients with severely disordered consciousness post-TBI potential MBS candidates .
Result	Implications and continued research needs are discussed .

Background	To identify key factors associated with outcomes of patients who underwent 8 weeks of physical therapy ( PT ) for lateral epicondylitis .
Method	Multicenter prospective design with inception cohort of lateral epicondylitis patients commencing PT .
Method	Baseline clinical examinations were conducted by 1 physical therapist ; self-report outcome measures were completed at baseline and 8 weeks later .
Method	Nine private sports medicine clinics and 2 hospital outpatient departments in Ontario , Canada .
Method	Eighty-three patients with unilateral lateral epicondylitis identified by the treating physical therapists .
Method	Not applicable .
Method	The final scores of the Disability of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire and a vertical pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) were used as the dependent variables .
Result	The final prognostic model for the 8-week DASH scores included the baseline score ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.34-0 .66 ) , sex ( female ) ( 95 % CI , 3.3-14 .5 ) , and self-reported nerve symptoms ( 95 % CI , 0.8-13 .8 ) .
Result	The model for the 8-week VAS scores included the baseline score ( 95 % CI , 0.01-0 .37 ) , sex ( female ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4-18 .2 ) , and self-reported nerve symptoms ( 95 % CI , 4.7-25 .5 ) .
Result	A subanalysis indicated that women were more likely than men to have work-related onsets , repetitive keyboarding jobs , and cervical joint signs .
Result	Among women , these factors were associated with higher final DASH and VAS scores .
Result	Women and patients who report nerve symptoms are more likely to experience a poorer short-term outcome after PT management of lateral epicondylitis .
Result	Work-related onsets , repetitive keyboarding jobs , and cervical joint signs have a prognostic influence on women .

Background	To determine tolerability and symptom changes associated with the introduction of bisoprolol treatment in older patients with heart failure .
Method	Prospective observational cohort study .
Method	Geriatric medicine outpatient department of a university hospital .
Method	51 patients ( mean age 78 years , range 70-89 years ) with stable symptomatic heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
Method	Bisoprolol tablets , 1.25-10 .0 mg .
Method	Tolerability ; changes in symptoms and exercise tolerance .
Result	69 % of patients tolerated bisoprolol .
Result	Mean tolerated dose was 7.6 mg .
Result	There was no change in symptoms or exercise capacity in those who tolerated bisoprolol .
Result	Perceived health status and symptoms of anxiety and depression improved during the titration period .
Result	The rate of withdrawal from bisoprolol treatment in older patients with congestive heart failure was twice that previously reported in younger patients .
Result	The mean tolerated dose was similar to that found in trials reporting clinical efficacy .
Result	There was no evidence of a negative impact on symptoms or exercise capacity in patients who tolerated bisoprolol .

Background	Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) has a number of severe and disabling consequences , including chronic pain , and around 40 % of patients develop persistent neuropathic pain .
Background	Pain following SCI has a detrimental impact on the patient 's quality of life and is a major specific healthcare problem in its own right .
Background	Thus far , there is no cure for the pain and oral pharmaceutical intervention is often inadequate , commonly resulting in a reduction of only 20-30 % in pain intensity .
Background	Neuropathic pain sensations are characterized by spontaneous persistent pain and a range of abnormally evoked responses , e.g. allodynia ( pain evoked by normally non-noxious stimuli ) and hyperalgesia ( an increased response to noxious stimuli ) .
Background	Neuropathic pain following SCI may be present at or below the level of injury .
Background	Oral pharmacological agents used in the treatment of neuropathic pain act either by depressing neuronal activity , by blocking sodium channels or inhibiting calcium channels , by increasing inhibition via GABA agonists , by serotonergic and noradrenergic reu
Background	At present , only ten randomized , double-blind , controlled trials have been performed on oral drug treatment of pain after SCI , the results of most of which were negative .
Background	The studies included antidepressants ( amitriptyline and trazodone ) , antiepileptics ( gabapentin , pregabalin , lamotrigine and valproate ) and mexiletine .
Result	Gabapentin , pregabalin and amitriptyline showed a significant reduction in neuropathic pain following SCI .
Result	Cannabinoids have been found to relieve other types of central pain , and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors as well as opioids relieve peripheral neuropathic pain and may be used to treat patients with SCI pain .

Background	To determine the carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) , both methicillin sensitive , and methicillin resistant ( MRSA ) , among employees of a nursing home in the absence of an epidemic .
Method	Observational study .
Method	A 210-bed suburban skilled nursing facility with a low endemic rate of SA infection .
Method	Seventy-three asymptomatic employees recruited in two waves .
Method	Nasal swabs were cultured for SA ; DNA strain typing was performed on MRSA isolates from the first wave of recruits .
Result	21 of 73 ( 29 % ) cultures were positive for SA .
Result	Ten of these 21 ( 14 % of participating employees ) had nasal carriage of MRSA .
Result	MRSA carriage was not significantly correlated with age , duration of employment , or job type ( clinical vs. non-clinical ) , and DNA strain typing suggested that employee carriage of MRSA was not the result of a common source .
Result	Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is common among skilled nursing facility personnel , and MRSA accounts for a substantial proportion of SA carriage among employees , even in the absence of an epidemic .
Result	Further research is needed to determine whether the high SA carriage rates among employees reflects work place acquisition , and , if so , whether it poses a hazard to the employees .
Result	The low incidence of nosocomial MRSA infections around the time of the study suggests that with usual infection control practices ( eg , hand washing ) , MRSA-colonized caregivers pose little risk to nursing facility residents .

Background	To clarify the relationship between the westernization of dietary habits and the changes of mortality from breast and ovarian cancers in Japan , correlation analyses were performed using data from the Vital Statistics and National Nutritional Survey Report
Result	With increasing population size of the areas , the age-adjusted death rates ( AADRs ) for both types of cancer increased together with the per capita intakes of fat , animal protein and western-style foods such as butter & margarine , cheese , ham & sau
Result	The association of the AADRs with the population size was strong after the age group of 45-54 years in breast cancer , and became stronger as the age increased in ovarian cancer .
Result	The association of the AADRs with western-style foods was also observed in the correlation analyses among the 12 geographical districts in Japan .
Result	From chronological correlation analyses , the correlation coefficients for some nutrients and foods in breast cancer were highest when the `` time-lag '' between the foods/nutrients intake and the cancer mortality was assumed to be around 10 years .
Result	The results of the present study suggest that an increase of western-style fat-rich foods such as butter & margarine , cheese , bread and ham & sausage among Japanese might be associated with the recent increase of AADRs for breast cancer and ovaria

Background	The validity of correcting for demographic variables when considering neuropsychological test scores was evaluated in a sample of 136 patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) who had been screened carefully for premorbid or comorbid confounding factors .
Result	When considered in concert with neurological variables , age and education accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in raw scores on the Category Test and the Trail Making Test in the complete sample .
Result	Gender did not affect level of test performance .
Result	Correcting neuropsychological test scores for demographic variables did not significantly alter their success in identifying patients with severe TBI , but did lead to greater accuracy when classifying individuals with mild-moderate TBI .
Result	This investigation concluded that norms that consider the demographic background of the individual are likely to reflect more accurately the neuropsychological status of patients with TBI than interpretations that are based exclusively on raw data .

Background	To describe pain and associated variables in a prevalence group of persons with a sustained spinal cord injury ( SCI ) in the Swedish capital and its surroundings .
Method	Spinalis SCI Unit ( outpatient clinic ) , Stockholm , Sweden .
Method	Assessment over a 12-month period in a yearly health control .
Method	Four hundred and fifty-six SCI patients .
Result	Two hundred and ninety-one out of 456 SCI patients ( 63.7 % ) suffered from pain , and in 45.7 % of these it was classified as being neurogenic .
Result	Aching pain was the most used descriptor ( 38.5 % ) .
Result	The onset of pain was commonly within three months ( 73.5 % ) .
Result	In 70.4 % of patients pain occurred below the level of the lesion .
Result	Most patients identified pain as coming from one ( 55.0 % ) or two ( 28.2 % ) body regions .
Result	Rating of the general pain intensity on a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) was 46 out of 100 and rating of the worst pain intensity was 78 out of 100 .
Result	Ninety-four out of 276 patients ( 32.3 % ) considered that their quality of life was significantly affected by pain .
Result	Pain was most common in patients with incomplete lesions ( ASIA impairment grade D ) and there was a correlation between pain and higher mean age at injury and between pain and female gender .

Background	The majority of Americans die in hospitals where shortcomings in end-of-life care are endemic .
Background	Patients often die alone , in pain , their wishes unheeded by physicians .
Background	Hospitalists can improve end-of-life care in hospitals dramatically .
Background	Hospitalists must relieve symptoms , such as pain , dyspnea , nausea , vomiting , delirium , and depression ; communicate clearly ; and provide support to patients and families .
Background	Hospitalists can increase the number and the timeliness of hospice referrals , allowing more patients to die at home .
Background	Finally , physicians must attend to their own sense of grief and loss to avoid burnout and to continue to reap the rewards end-of-life care provides .

Background	The aim of the study was to explore the way psychiatric symptoms might influence independent psychiatric assessment of outcome one year after stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy .
Result	In a sample of 34 patients consecutively accepted for psychosurgery the results showed that both ` good ' and ` poor ' outcome groups improved overall .
Result	No patients were significantly worse and the symptoms which improved most were nervous tension , depressed mood and somatic anxiety .
Result	It was not possible to identify symptomatic predictors of outcome because the preoperative symptom profiles of both groups were so similar .

Background	To evaluate the Quality of Life ( QoL ) among siblings of autistic patients .
Method	Casuistic : siblings of autistic patients ( n = 31 ) and , as a control group , siblings of patients with speech disorder ( n = 30 ) .
Method	Inclusion criteria age between 7 and 11 years old ; absence of current mental disorder ; regular attendance to school .
Method	Exclusion criteria antecedents of clinical or psychiatric diseases ; disabilities ( visual , auditive or motor ) ; antecedents of cognitive and/or intelligence disabilities .
Method	Instruments included a questionnaire which evaluated the quality of life in a subjective way .
Result	it was observed worse QoL among siblings of autistic patients ( p = 0.000 ) .
Result	The hypothesis that the quality of life was compromised in children ( aged 7 to 11 ) by the presence of an autistic sibling was confirmed , and was worse than that of siblings of children with speech disorders .

Background	The effects of lecithinized superoxide dismutase ( PC-SOD ) and/or methylpredisolone ( MP ) in preventing secondary pathological changes after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) were investigated in rats with reference to recovery of hindlimb motor function and express
Method	Hindlimb motor function was assessed as the BBB open field locomotor scores .
Result	The BBB scores of three groups treated with either PC-SOD ( 40,000 units/kg ) , MP ( 30 mg/kg ) , or a combination of PC-SOD and MP ( PC-SOD + MP ) increased with time until 3 days after SCI , and were significantly higher than that of the control group ( p < 0.05
Result	Thereafter , the score of the PC-SOD group increased , whereas that of the MP group showed a temporary decrease from day 3 to 5 and then it gradually recovered .
Result	The scores in all groups reached a plateau about 18 days after SCI .
Result	The PC-SOD + MP group did not show a synergism but a tendency similar to that of the MP group .
Result	PC-SOD and MP had down-regulatory effects on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and inducible-nitric oxide synthetase ( i-NOS ) after spinal cord compression at 3 ,
Result	The suppression of pro-inflammatory genes expression , especially IL-1beta were greater in the MP group than in the PC-SOD group , while suppression of LPO level was similar in these two groups .
Result	PC-SOD + MP treatment augmented the suppression of all three pro-inflammatory genes expression and the decrease of the LPO level .
Result	The level of neurotrophin-3 ( NT-3 ) mRNA increased from 6 h after SCI and reached a maximum after 48 h.
Result	NT-3 mRNA level was enhanced by PC-SOD treatment , but not by MP treatment .
Result	Thus , the effect of MP in suppressing these pro-inflammatory genes expression was more than that of PC-SOD .
Result	The difference in motor function in the early and later stage may be partially due to differences in expression of IL-1beta and NT-3 after either treatment , through an IL-1beta-dependent or NT-3-mediated repair response .

Background	To examine functional improvement patterns of persons with stroke , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , and spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .
Method	Statistical analysis of data from a multisite study evaluating rehabilitation outcomes .
Method	Eight inpatient rehabilitation facilities .
Method	A total of 314 consecutive admissions of persons with stroke , SCI , and TBI who received acute medical rehabilitation between 1994 and 1998 .
Method	Calibration of motor and cognitive items from the FIM instrument , grouping of cases by number of weeks of rehabilitation ( length of stay [ LOS ] groups ) , and plotting of weekly averages across time .
Method	Weekly motor and cognitive functional status .
Result	With the exception of cognitive functioning for persons with SCI , LOS was related to initial functional status , with patients with greater disability having longer LOS ( eg , initial motor status for persons with stroke was 48.3 for those with a 2-week stay
Result	With the exception of cognitive gains for person with TBIs , the amount of functional gain during rehabilitation was essentially the same for all LOS groups ( eg , the overall average total motor gain for persons with SCI is 22.3 , with no patterns of increas
Result	When examined separately for persons grouped by LOS , functional status improved linearly during the rehabilitation stay , with differences in rate of improvement depending on initial functional status .

Method	Imipramine and amitriptyline , nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors , citalopram , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , and maprotiline , selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor , were tested after intracerebroventricular ( icv ) and intrathecal ( it )
Result	All drugs evoked dose-dependent analgesia after icv but not after it microinjections .
Result	The changes in the nociceptive behavior of rats pre-treated with antidepressants were not due to the non-specific influences of the drugs on the animals ' gross behavior , as revealed by the open field test .
Result	The obtained results suggest that an antidepressant-induced analgesia mainly depends on the supraspinal effect with minor , if any , contribution from the spinal mechanisms .

Background	There have been many reports that spinal anesthesia induces severe lightning pain in the lower limbs of patients with phantom limb pain , tabes dorsalis , or causalgia .
Background	We report on a patient with neuropathic pain of central origin who showed newly developed severe lightning pain after therapeutic subarachnoid block ( SAB ) .
Background	We performed SAB 16 times in this patient , and he complained of severe pain each time .
Background	We investigated which drug was best for treating such induced pain by administering various drugs to the patient .
Method	The patient was hospitalized for treatment and observation .
Method	The patient was a 48-year-old man with neuropathic pain secondary to an incomplete spinal cord injury at the cervical segment .
Method	Various drugs were administered for relieving the newly developed severe pain , and the effectiveness of these agents was compared .
Result	Intravenous thiopental , fentanyl , butorphanol , ketamine , midazolam , droperidol , and sevoflurane-oxygen anesthesia were quite effective .
Result	Intramuscular butorphanol was not effective .
Result	Intravenous physiologic saline and atropine sulfate as a placebo , intrathecal morphine hydrochloride , intravenous mexiletine , and lidocaine were ineffective .
Result	Intravenous thiopental ( approximately 1 mg/kg ) was thought to obtain the best pain relief because it stopped the pain quickly , the dose needed was subanesthetic , and there was no adverse effect .

Background	The n-3 and n-6 fatty acids linolenic acid and linoleic acid are precursors of the n-3 and n-6 longchain fatty acids ( LCPUFA ) .
Background	Infant formula has historically only contained the precursor fatty acids .
Background	Controversy exists over whether LCPUFA are also essential nutrients in infancy .
Background	Over the last few years some manufacturers have added LCPUFA to formulae and marketed them as providing an advantage for the development of term infants .
Method	The aim of this review is to assess whether supplementation of formula with LCPUFA is safe and of benefit to term infants .
Method	Trials were identified by MEDLINE , checking reference lists of articles and conference proceedings , and by personal communication .
Method	All randomised trials of formula supplemented with LCPUFA and with clinical endpoints were reviewed .
Method	Ten randomised studies were identified .
Method	One of these studies was excluded due to supplementation commencing after three weeks of age .
Method	Eight of the nine included trials were assessed to be of good quality .
Method	There was insufficient information available to assess the quality of the other included trial .
Result	Visual acuity was assessed by visual evoked potentials ( VEP ) at 4 and 7-8 months in the studies of Makrides et al ( 1995 & 1996 ) .
Result	The supplemented infants had an improved rate of visual maturation at both time points in the first study , but no difference was found between the groups at the same time points in the second study .
Result	VEP acuity was also assessed in the study of Austed et al ( 1997 ) and no effect of supplementation was found at any time point over the first year .
Result	This contrasts with the study of Birch et al ( 1998 ) where VEP acuity was better in the supplemented group compared with the control group at 6 weeks , 4 and 12 months but not at 6 months .
Result	Visual acuity was assessed by Teller acuity cards in the study of Carlson et al ( 1996 ) , Clausen et al ( 1996 ) , Austed et al ( 1997 ) and Birch et al ( 1998 ) .
Result	Supplementation had no effect on visual acuity over the first year of life except at one of five time points in the study of Carlson et al ( 1996 ) .
Result	Intellectual development was measured in seven studies .
Result	The two largest studies showed no effect of supplementation on development , either at 18 months ( Lucas et al 1999 ) or at one and three years ( Janowsky et al 1995 , Scott et al 1997 ) .
Result	The next largest study reported better developmental scores at 18 months in the supplemented group ( Birch et al 2000 ) but when combined with data of Lucas et al , no significant benefit is shown .
Result	Makrides et al ( 1995 & 1996 ) also showed no benefit to development with supplementation over the first two years of life .
Result	Agostini et al 1995 reported a benefit in development at 4 months of age with supplementation but when the infants were followed up with the same test at 1 and 2 years , no difference between groups was found ( Agostini et al 1997 ) .
Result	The Portland study showed no effect of supplementation on language development at one and three years ( Janowsky et al 1995 , Scott et al 1997 ) .
Result	Clausen et al ( 1996 ) reported better novelty preference measured by Fagan Infant test at nine months in supplemented infants compared with controls .
Result	Willatts et al ( 1998 ) reported better problem solving at 10 months with supplementation .
Result	Growth was measured in the studies of Makrides et al ( 1995 & 1996 ) , Austed et al ( 1997 ) , Willatts et al 1998 , Lucas et al 1999 and Birch et al 2000 .
Result	LCPUFA supplementation did not influence growth in any of these studies .
Result	At present there is little evidence from randomised trials of LCPUFA supplementation to support the hypothesis that LCPUFA supplementation confers a benefit for visual or general development of term infants .
Result	Minor effects on VEP acuity have been suggested but appear unlikely when all studies are reviewed .
Result	A beneficial effect on information processing is possible but larger studies over longer periods are required to conclude that LCPUFA supplementation provides a benefit when compared with standard formula .
Result	Data from randomised trials do not suggest that LCPUFA supplements influence the growth of term infants .

Background	To analyse the behaviour of pre-surgical serum levels of soluble ( s ) E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( sVCAM ) in patients with colorectal cancer , and to evaluate their possible correlation with carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , pro-inflammatory
Method	Pre-surgical serum levels of sE-selectin , sVCAM , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-1beta , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and CEA were measured in 194 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma , 40 patients with benign colorectal diseases and 59 healthy subj
Result	sE-selectin , sVCAM , TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with colorectal cancer compared to either healthy subjects or patients with benign disease .
Result	Positive rates of sE-selectin , sVCAM and TNF-alpha levels were significantly associated with Dukes ' stage D colorectal cancer , and all three variables were independently associated to the presence of distant metastases .
Result	Positive sE-selectin , sVCAM and TNF-alpha levels were significantly associated to CEA .
Result	TNF-alpha and CEA levels were independently related to the presence of positive levels of sE-selectin and/or sVCAM .
Result	Our findings suggest that the host inflammatory response to cancer cells , and/or their released products ( i.e. CEA ) , might be responsible ( via cytokine release ) for the elevation in circulating adhesion molecules in patients with colorectal cancer .

Background	Evaluating interventions in palliative care using randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) has helped advance the specialty and create an evidence base for the delivery of care .
Background	RCTs , however , are notoriously difficult to conduct in palliative care , raising a variety of practical , ethical and moral dilemmas .
Background	Mixed-methods research , which combines qualitative research and RCTs , offers a potential solution to these problems .
Background	This paper begins by examining the theoretical basis for combining the two approaches , before reviewing the specific role qualitative research could play in planning , conducting and implementing trials .
Background	The paper then goes on to explore how palliative care research currently uses the mixed-methods approach , by searching the trials included in six Cochrane Systematic Reviews ( n = 146 ) on the incorporation of qualitative research .
Result	Only one trial undertook qualitative research .
Result	These findings reflect some of the challenges facing mixed-methods research , which include lack of experience in a research team , the problems of obtaining funding and difficulties in publishing .
Result	The paper concludes that while combining qualitative and quantitative research is not a panacea for methodological problems in palliative care research , with careful planning and integration , the approach may enhance the clinical and ethical utility of tr

Method	Twenty infertile women with a history of diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero were seen in Norfolk for the purpose of in vitro fertilization .
Background	Seventeen patients had undergone 25 stimulated cycles with harvest of oocytes by laparoscopy .
Method	The serum estradiol response to stimulation in these patients and the number and quality of oocytes retrieved did not differ significantly from those of patients with infertility due to blocked fallopian tubes .
Result	There were four pregnancies in 17 patients after 21 cycles of embryo transfers , for a pregnancy rate of 23.5 % per patient , or 19 % per embryo transfer .
Result	Two of the pregnant patients have had a term delivery , one has had a preclinical abortion , and one has a single intrauterine gestation in progress .

Background	To evaluate changes in autonomic nervous system controls in response to obstructive events in future victims of sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) , we studied the polysomnographic sleep recordings of 18 future SIDS infants and those of 36 matched control
Method	A heart rate autoregressive power spectral analysis was performed preceding and after the obstructive apneas .
Method	The low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio was computed to evaluate sympathovagal balance .
Result	Future SIDS victims had significantly more obstructive apneas ( p = 0.001 ) and mixed apneas ( p = 0.005 ) than control infants .
Result	Obstructive events occurred mainly during rapid eye movement sleep in the two populations ( 84.5 % in future SIDS victims and 95.8 % in control infants ; p = NS ) .
Result	Comparing heart rate power spectral analysis before and after obstructive apneas in rapid eye movement sleep , high-frequency power values were significantly lower and low-frequency to high-frequency power ratios higher in future SIDS victims than in contr
Result	Compared with preapnea values , low-frequency to high-frequency power ratios significantly decreased after obstructive apneas in control infants ( p < 0.001 ) but not in the future SIDS victims .
Result	When the obstructive apneas were divided according to duration , the findings were seen mainly for long apneas .
Result	In conclusion , future SIDS victims were characterized by different autonomic status and responses to obstructive apneas during sleep .
Result	These findings could be relevant to mechanisms implicated in some cases of SIDS .

Background	Patients with increased daytime sleepiness are impaired in all areas of their social environment .
Background	Expert opinions are recommended for pension proceedings , regarding driving licenses as well as for restrictions at the workplace .
Background	All possibilities should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sleep disorders , which have to be treated before an expert opinion is submitted .
Background	Statutory regulations on evaluation of sleepiness are contained in the guidelines for assessing a patient 's fitness to drive .
Background	The importance of daytime sleepiness in other occupations should be assessed according to the respective workplace .
Background	The patient should be informed of the appraisal with regard to career choice and workplace design .
Background	The expert thus has the responsible task of carrying out interdisciplinary differential diagnosis of pathological sleepiness and monitoring treatment success with appropriate test methods .
Background	In the present paper the legal guidelines in Germany and available test methods are presented .

Background	To compare cranial ultrasound studies and neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants affected by maternal floor infarction ( MFI ) of the placenta to gestational age-matched controls over an 8-year period from a single institution .
Method	Retrospective case/control study .
Result	Compared to gestational age-matched controls , infants born to mothers with MFI had a higher incidence of CNS injury on neonatal cranial ultrasound examinations and at follow-up were more likely to have a suspicious or abnormal neurologic examination .
Result	MFI cases had lower developmental scores in all areas tested and were more likely to have neurodevelopmental impairment .
Result	Infants born to mothers with MFI should have serial neonatal cranial ultrasound examinations to detect CNS injury and neurodevelopmental assessment during early childhood .

Background	This systematic review describes the diagnosis and management of adult patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of extradural malignant spinal cord compression ( MSCC ) .
Method	MEDLINE , CANCERLIT , and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to January 2004 using the following terms spinal cord compression , nerve compression syndromes , spinal cord neoplasms , clinical trial , meta-analysis , and systematic review .
Result	Symptoms for MSCC include sensory changes , autonomic dysfunction , and back pain ; however , back pain was not predictive of MSCC .
Result	The sensitivity and specificity for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) range from 0.44 to 0.93 and 0.90 to 0.98 , respectively , in the diagnosis of MSCC .
Result	The sensitivity and specificity for myelography range from 0.71 to 0.97 and 0.88 to 1.00 , respectively .
Result	A randomized study detected higher ambulation rates in patients with MSCC who received high-dose dexamethasone before radiotherapy ( RT ) compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids before RT ( 81 % v 63 % at 3 months , respectively ; P = .046 ) .
Result	There is no direct evidence that supports or refutes the type of surgery patients should have for the treatment of MSCC , whether surgical salvage should be attempted if patient is progressing on or shortly after RT , and whether patients with spinal instab
Result	Patients with symptoms of MSCC should be managed to minimize treatment delay .
Result	MRI is the preferred imaging technique .
Result	Treatment for patients with MSCC should consider pretreatment ambulatory status , comorbidities , technical surgical factors , the presence of bony compression and spinal instability , potential surgical complications , potential RT reactions , and patient pref

Background	Intracranial pressure monitoring is recommended for the management of severe head injury and is increasingly used during intensive care for other pathologies , such as subarachnoid hemorrhage .
Background	However , it is still not uniformly applied in different centers .
Background	The objectives of this paper are to summarize the frequency and the modalities of intracranial pressure ( ICP ) monitoring in different centers in Italy ; to describe its use in traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and in subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) ; and to identi
Method	The medical directors of either the neurosurgical department or the intensive care unit , or both , of every Italian neurosurgical center were personally interviewed .
Method	They answered specific questions about TBI and SAH patients admitted , and ICP monitoring used , in their units .
Method	Data were cleared of any obvious inconsistencies and entered in a database for analysis .
Method	All analyses were based simply on the data declared .
Method	The clinical information was obtained from 9137 TBI cases , of whom 4240 severe , and 3151 SAH patients .
Result	Among the 106 participating centers , 15 did not use ICP monitoring at all .
Result	The remaining 91 had used 3293 ICP devices during the year 2001 ; 146 were used in tumor cases , 2009 in TBI , and 1138 in SAH .
Result	Twenty-two percent of TBI cases admitted to centers with ICP equipment were monitored .
Result	Restricting this analysis to severe cases , 47 % of TBI with a GCS < 8 had ICP .
Result	On average , 36 % of SAH underwent ICP monitoring .
Result	The proportions of head injury and SAH cases who underwent ICP monitoring varied widely in the different centers .
Result	Dividing the country into three main areas ( north , center and south ) , there were considerable differences both in the rate of admissions per million inhabitants and in the frequency of ICP monitoring .
Result	ICP monitoring in Italy is used in most , but not all , centers .
Result	ICP is measured fairly extensively in head injury cases , but a significant proportion of SAH patients is monitored as well .
Result	There are substantial differences in the frequency of ICP monitoring in different parts of the country .
Result	The use of ICP for both these indications , and the rates of admission to specialized centers , could be improved .

Background	The main aims of this paper are to describe the setting and design of a Minimal Intervention in general practice for Stress-related mental disorders in patients on Sick leave ( MISS ) , as well as to ascertain the study complies with the requirements for a c
Background	The potential adverse consequences of sick leave due to Stress-related Mental Disorders ( SMDs ) are extensive , but often not recognised .
Background	Since most people having SMDs with sick leave consult their general practitioner ( GP ) at an early stage , a tailored intervention given by GPs is justified .
Background	We provide a detailed description of the MISS ; that is more accurate assessment , education , advice and monitoring to treat SMDs in patients on sick leave .
Method	Our hypothesis is that the MISS will be more effective compared to the usual care , in reducing days of sick leave of these patients .
Method	The design is a pragmatic RCT .
Method	Randomisation is at the level of GPs .
Method	They received the MISS-training versus no training , in order to compare the MISS vs. usual care at patient level .
Method	Enrollment of patients took place after screening in the source population , that comprised 20-60 year old primary care attendees .
Method	Inclusion criteria were moderately elevated distress levels , having a paid job and sick leave for no longer than three months .
Method	There is a one year follow up .
Method	The primary outcome measure is lasting full return to work .
Method	Reduction of SMD - symptoms is one of the secondary outcome measures .
Method	Forty-six GPs and 433 patients agreed to participate .
Result	In our study design , attention is given to the practical application of the requirements for a pragmatic trial .
Result	The results of this cluster RCT will add to the evidence about treatment options in general practice for SMDs in patients on sick leave , and might contribute to a new and appropriate guideline .
Result	These results will be available at the end of 2006 .

Background	The offspring of women with hypertension during pregnancy are at increased risk of low birthweight , preterm birth , diseases of prematurity and death .
Background	The risk of developing these outcomes among women with either preeclampsia or chronic hypertension , relative to those with gestational hypertension , is not known .
Method	Prospective cohort study .
Method	A total of 1948 singleton women seen at a large tertiary care obstetrical center , whose blood pressure was greater than 140/90 mm Hg during pregnancy .
Method	The four types of hypertension were strictly defined 864 women ( 44.4 % ) had gestational hypertension , 459 ( 23.6 % ) isolated chronic hypertension , 501 ( 25.7 % ) isolated preeclampsia , and 124 ( 6.4 % ) chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia .
Method	The primary outcome of the study was a composite of the diseases of prematurity , need for assisted ventilation for greater than 1 day , or perinatal death .
Method	The secondary outcomes were each of those included in the primary endpoint , as well as admission to the neonatal ICU , small for gestational age ( SGA ) birthweight and preterm birth .
Method	We controlled for the effects of other maternal risk factors , such as age , parity , history of preterm delivery , cigarette smoking , pre-pregnancy weight , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , renal dysfunction , and current use of an antihypertensive agent or prednisone .
Result	For the primary composite outcome , compared to the offspring of women with gestational hypertension , the adjusted odds ratio was 1.9 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.2 to 3.0 ) in the preeclamptic group and 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.0 to 4.0 ) for those with
Result	Those with preeclampsia were at increased risk for small for gestational age birthweight ( odds ratio 2.2 , 95 % confidence interval 1.5 to 3.1 ) , as were the offspring of mothers who had chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia ( odds ratio 2.1 , 95
Result	Similarly , the rate of preterm birth before 32 weeks was highest among the infants of both preeclamptic mothers ( 28.5 % ; odds ratio 4.7 , 95 % confidence interval 2.9 to 7.6 ) and those with chronic hypertension and preeclampsia ( 30.5 % ; odds ratio 3.5 , 95 % co
Result	The perinatal mortality rate was highest in the group of women with chronic hypertension plus preeclampsia ( 9.2 % ; odds ratio 3.2 , 95 % confidence interval 1.2 to 9.1 ) .
Result	Other significant risk factors for the primary composite outcome included previous preterm delivery ( odds ratio 2.7 , 95 % confidence interval 1.4 to 5.2 ) , smoking ( odds ratio 1.8 , 95 % confidence interval 1.1 to 3.0 ) and use of an antihypertensive agent dur
Result	Prednisone use was strongly associated with risk for perinatal death ( odds ratio 4.9 , 95 % confidence interval 1.4 to 17.1 ) .
Result	Relative to women with isolated gestational hypertension , those who develop preeclampsia , either with or without underlying chronic hypertension , experience worse perinatal outcomes .
Result	A history of previous preterm delivery and maternal smoking increase the rate preterm birth and major perinatal disease .
Result	Antihypertensive and prednisone therapy may be important risk factors for adverse perinatal events , but further research is needed to confirm these findings .

Background	Retention is the phase of orthodontic treatment that attempts to keep teeth in the corrected positions after orthodontic ( dental ) braces .
Background	Without a phase of retention there is a tendency for the teeth to return to their initial position ( relapse ) .
Background	To prevent relapse almost every patient who has orthodontic treatment will require some type of retention .
Method	To evaluate the effectiveness of different retention strategies used to stabilise tooth position after orthodontic braces .
Method	The Cochrane Oral Health Group 's Trials Register , CENTRAL , MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched .
Method	Several journals were handsearched .
Method	No language restrictions were applied .
Method	Authors of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) were identified and contacted to identify unpublished trials .
Method	Most recent search December 2002 .
Method	RCTs on children and adults , who have had retainers fitted or adjunctive procedures undertaken , following orthodontic treatment with braces to prevent relapse .
Method	The outcomes are how well the teeth are stabilised , survival of retainers , adverse effects on oral health and quality of life .
Method	Screening of eligible studies , assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers .
Method	As no two studies compared the same retention strategies ( interventions ) it was not possible to combine the results of any studies .
Result	Four trials satisfied the inclusion criteria .
Result	These trials all compared different interventions : circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy ( CSF ) combined with full-time removable retainer versus a full-time removable retainer alone ; circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy ( CSF ) combined with a nights-o
Result	There was weak unreliable evidence , based on data from one trial , that there was a statistically significant increase in stability in both the mandibular ( p < 0.001 ) and maxillary anterior segments ( p < 0.001 ) when the CSF was used , compared with wh
Result	There was also weak , unreliable evidence that teeth settle quicker with a Hawley retainer than with a clear overlay retainer after 3 months .
Result	The quality of the trial reports was generally poor .
Result	There are insufficient research data on which to base our clinical practice on retention at present .
Result	There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials in this crucial area of orthodontic practice .

Background	Early proper diagnostics and treatment of developmental age pathologies in most cases facilitate correct sex organ development , as well as reproductive functions formation .
Background	To make the foregoing possible , it is necessary to apply minimally invasive and safest methods like vaginoscopy , hysteroscopy and laparoscopy .
Background	The main application field of vaginoscopy and hysteroscopy in pediatric and adolescent gynecology is the diagnosis and treatment of vulvar and vaginal pathologies and developmental anomalies of sex organ .
Background	The laparoscopy is becoming a more and more popular method in the treatment of adnexal tumors in children , due to its little invasiveness , quick recovery and less severe pain complaints after the surgery .
Background	The application of these endoscopic procedures should always be preceded by the complex noninvasive diagnostics , such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging .
Background	The endoscopic procedures facilitate wide-ranging diagnostics and simultaneously therapeutic management , ensuring minimal invasion and high safety of the surgery .
Background	They should be considered diagnostics and treatment of choice in the pathology of vulva , vagina , developmental anomalies of sex organ and adnexal tumors in patients of the developmental age .

Background	Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk , but the impact of mild forms of OSA and their treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remains controversial .
Method	To prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes in treated versus untreated patients with OSA .
Method	Consecutive sleep laboratory patients with all degrees of OSA were included .
Method	Endpoints were nonfatal ( myocardial infarction , stroke , and acute coronary syndrome requiring revascularization procedures ) and fatal ( death from myocardial infarction or stroke ) cardiovascular events .
Method	Comparison of event-free survival rates in treated versus untreated patients ( Kaplan-Meier estimates , log-rank test ) .
Method	Of 449 patients enrolled ( age , 56.0 + / - 10.5 years ; body mass index , 30.8 + / - 5.4 kg/m ( 2 ) ) , 364 patients received OSA treatment , and 85 patients remained untreated .
Method	Median follow-up was 72.0 months ( range , 1-156 ) .
Result	Mean apnea-hypopnea index before treatment was 30.9 + / - 21.8 / hour in treated and 15.3 + / - 13.0 / hour in untreated patients , but there were no differences in cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors .
Result	In patients with mild-moderate OSA ( n = 288 ) , events were more frequent in untreated patients ( estimated event-free survival at 10 yr , 51.8 vs. 80.3 % [ P < 0.001 ] ; absolute risk reduction , 28.5 % ; number needed to treat to prevent one event/10 yr , 3.5 ) .
Result	After adjustment for age , gender , cardiovascular risk factors , and comorbidities at baseline , OSA treatment was an independent predictor for events ( hazard ratio , 0.36 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.21-0 .62 ; P < 0.001 ) .
Result	OSA treatment was associated with a cardiovascular risk reduction of 64 % independent from age and preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities .
Result	OSA treatment should be considered for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention , even in milder OSA .

Background	To compare the rates of mental health problems , disability and use of health and social services of older people living in sheltered accommodation with those of the rest of the community in the same age group .
Method	Door-to-door survey in randomly selected enumeration districts .
Method	The districts contained three sheltered accommodation complexes .
Method	Residents from these addresses were compared with the others .
Method	London Borough of Islington .
Method	700 men and women aged 65 or over .
Method	Short-CARE depression , dementia and activity scales ; the Guy 's / Age Concern anxiety scale ; individual items detailing problems with mobility , vision and hearing ; use of a number of health and social services .
Result	The only difference in mental health variables on univariate analysis was a greater severity of cognitive impairment and dementia symptoms in sheltered accommodation .
Result	When demographic differences were taken into account , the association with cognitive impairment became statistically insignificant .
Result	There were significant associations between residence in sheltered accommodation and several of the disability variables .
Result	Increased use of health and social services by sheltered residents remained significant after disability and living alone were taken into account .
Result	The residents of sheltered accommodation were more disabled than the general elderly population but , in contrast to those in residential care , did not have a great excess of mental health problems .
Result	Indeed , the possibility was raised that sheltered accommodation may protect against depression in people who live alone .

Background	Our purpose in this cross-sectional study with 1,598 adult clients who had intellectual disabilities was to obtain valid prevalences of sensory impairments and to identify associations .
Method	The diagnoses were made through ophthalmologic and audiometric assessments , applying WHO/IASSID definitions .
Result	Re-weighted prevalences were 5.0 % ( 95 % CI 3.9 - 6.2 % ) for the total adult population ; 2.9 % ( 1.9-4 .1 ) , less than 50 years ; and 11.0 % ( 7.9 - 14.7 ) , 50 years and over .
Result	Apart from being 50 years of age and over , p = .000 , risk factors were more severe intellectual disability , p = .0001 , and Down syndrome , p = .001 .
Result	Results show that the risk of combined sensory impairment in this population is considerably increased compared with the general population .
Result	Part of the underlying conditions are treatable or can be rehabilitated .
Result	However , the complete diagnosis had been identified in only 12 % .

Background	In this secondary data analysis of Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly ( PRIMSe ) study , we hypothesized that older minorities who receive mental health services integrated in primary care settings would have greater s
Method	We identified 2,022 ( 48 % minorities ) primary care patients 65 years and older , who met study inclusion criteria and had either alcohol misuse , depression , and/or anxiety .
Method	They were randomized to receive treatment for these disorders in the primary care clinic or to a brokerage case management model that linked patients to community-based services .
Method	Service use and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline , three months and six months post randomization on all participants .
Result	Access to and participation in mental health / substance abuse services was greater in the integrated model than in referral ; there were no treatment by ethnicity effects .
Result	There were no treatment effects for any of the clinical outcomes ; Whites and older minorities in both integrated and referral groups failed to show clinically significant improvement in symptoms and physical functioning at 6 months .
Result	While providing services in primary care results in better access to and use of these services , accessing these services is not enough for assuring adequate clinical outcomes .

Background	Kyphoplasty , the newest of the tools treating vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures ( VOCF ) is the evolution of vertebroplasty , allowing not only pain control and strengthening of the fractured vertebra , but also offering the possibility to restore
Method	We present our series of 41 consecutive VOCF treated by kyphoplasty in 30 patients between October 2003 and March 2006 .
Method	Systematic spinal X rays and CT scan have be performed , occasionally followed by bone scintigraphy or spinal MRI .
Method	The mean preoperative duration of symptoms before surgery was 52 days .
Result	Pain control after the operation was considered excellent in all cases and all patients were mobilized the day after surgery .
Result	Kyphoplasty allowed a 50 % restoration of vertebral height in 66 % of the treated vertebras .
Result	The results were better when surgery was performed within the first three months after the fracture .
Result	The mean vertebral deformity correction by comparison of the pre - and postoperative Cobb angles was 9.7 degrees .
Result	One patient showed cement leakage in the spinal canal without neurological deterioration .
Result	The mean postoperative stay was 2.5 days .
Result	We found kyphoplasty to be a safe technique allowing immediate pain control after VOCF , with minimal risks of cement leakage or pulmonary embolism .
Result	Vertebral height and deformity correction are best achieved with early surgery , but pain control is always excellent even with a delayed procedure .

Background	Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a frequent and serious infection in cirrhotic patients with ascites .
Background	A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis and rapid institution of treatment .
Background	The common micro-organisms involved in SBP are the aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci that inhabit the intestine .
Background	Empiric antibiotic therapy active against these organisms should be instituted as soon as possible to improve survival .
Background	Third generation cephalosporins are very effective and safe as the initial empiric antibiotic regimen .
Background	Alternatives include beta-lactam-clavulanic acid combinations and other broad-spectrum antibiotics , although cost benefit considerations are important in selection .
Background	If cultures and susceptibility tests allow , antibiotic therapy should be altered to provide optimum narrow-spectrum and cost-effective treatment .
Background	Recent evidence suggests that ( at least in the case of cefotaxime ) , 5-day treatment is equally effective as 10-day treatment .
Background	Except in patients awaiting liver transplantation , antibiotic prophylaxis of SBP is not recommended at present , as the few trials performed have not been able to demonstrate superior results for survival , hospital admissions or cost-effectiveness , over pr

Background	The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and rate of complications in patients undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty ( PVP ) for vertebral compression fractures as a result of secondary osteoporosis caused by long-term corticosteroid use com
Method	A retrospective review of all patients undergoing PVP was conducted to identify patients who also received long-term corticosteroid therapy .
Method	Outcomes including pain , periprocedural complications , and frequency of new fractures in patients receiving corticosteroids were compared with control patients undergoing PVP for primary osteoporosis .
Result	Sixty-eight patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy underwent 79 PVP procedures .
Result	Patients treated with corticosteroids undergoing PVP were significantly younger and more likely to be male compared with control subjects .
Result	Patients receiving long-term corticosteroid treatment experienced significant pain relief immediately postprocedure and at 1 week , 1 month , 6 months , 1 year and 2 years postprocedure ( P < .0001 at all time points ) .
Result	Patients receiving corticosteroids experienced similar decreases in pain from baseline compared with control subjects at all follow-up time points ( P > .05 ) .
Result	The complication rate for patients receiving corticosteroids was 4.4 % compared with 3.4 % for control subjects ( P = .60 ) .
Result	Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment did not have an increased risk of new fractures after PVP compared with control subjects ( P = .68 ) .
Result	Percutaneous vertebroplasty performed for vertebral compression fractures as a result of long-term corticosteroid therapy is as safe and effective in relieving pain as PVP performed in patients with vertebral compression fractures as a result of primary o

Background	Family medicine remains strongly influenced by reactive medicine ( ` tyranny of the urgent ' ) and the fragmentation of healthcare associated with it .
Background	In the first part of the present article the increasing practical and economic relevance of chronic diseases and multimorbidity were analyzed as a fundamental challenge for primary care and family medicine in particular .
Background	Part two describes a forward-looking approach to guidelines and special tools which are able to guide and support future healthcare tasks of general practice .
Background	Wagner 's Chronic Care Model , which was developed on the basis of numerous controlled studies , integrates empirical results , theoretical ideas and real experience within a comprehensive concept for the treatment of chronic diseases .
Method	The model focuses on the ` productive interaction ' between an active patient and a proactive practice team .
Result	The various elements of the model help to better understand healthcare in general practices , for example by establishing reminder and recall systems by means of a structured reorganization , through patient registers , the implementation of consultation hou
Result	Case management ' is essential to the success of structured care .
Result	Taking care of patients with major depression as an example , it is demonstrated how case management through practice assistants in general practices enables the individual needs of chronically ill patients to be better taken into account .
Result	The professionalism of the practice team with new roles and task sharing as well as the implementation of modern strategies for the care of chronically ill patients provide a new chance and a sharpened profile for general practices of the future .

Background	The goal of the present study was to determine whether dietary supply of omega-3 essential fatty acid ( EFA ) influences visual development in healthy pre-term and full-term infants .
Method	Visual status was examined in human milk-fed infants ( ample dietary omega-3 EFA supply ) and corn oil-based formula-fed infants ( no dietary omega-3 EFA ; standard formula prior to 1987 ) .
Result	At 57 weeks postconception ( 4 months adjusted age ) , both pre-term and full-term human milk-fed infants had significantly better visual evoked potential ( VEP ) and forced-choice preferential-looking ( FPL ) acuity than formula-fed infants .
Result	Acuity was correlated with a dietary omega-3 sufficiency index from red blood cell membranes obtained at 57 weeks postconception .
Result	At 36 months , full-term human milk-fed children had significantly better random dot stereo acuity and letter matching ability than formula-fed children .
Result	Stereo acuity and performance on the letter matching test were correlated with a dietary omega-3 sufficiency index from red blood cell membranes obtained at 4 months .
Result	These results suggest that dietary omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in visual development .

Background	To study the attitudes and beliefs towards general practice of rural secondary school students , in particular , their perception of the barriers to the effective delivery of primary health care .
Method	Students attending a government-funded secondary school in a rural community of less than 4000 people .
Method	250 students in years 7-12 were surveyed , with 177 ( 71 % ) replying , 45 % of these being male .
Method	Cross-sectional , self-administered questionnaire survey .
Result	The study found that most students value general practitioners ( GPs ) as valuable sources of health care , feel they have reasonable access to care and in most instances appear to attend appropriately for their health problems .
Result	Most felt their doctor would be an empathetic listener , would provide sufficient time to provide effective care and communicated in a language they could understand .
Result	Confidentiality issues were considered important , especially by females .
Result	Although students have very positive attitudes about general practice , the findings could be used to improve a number of GP services for young people in small rural communities .
Result	This is particularly so for presentations which require a high degree of confidentiality and skillful counselling , such as psychological problems and risk-taking behaviours .

Background	Substantial psychological and neurobehavioural evidence is available to support the hypothesis that traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a risk factor for subsequent psychiatric disorders .
Background	However , studies utilizing established psychiatric diagnostic schemes to study these outcomes after TBI are scarce , and no studies have included an assessment of personality disorders in addition to the major psychiatric disorders .
Method	This study utilizes structured psychiatric interviews to measure the prevalence of DSM-III ( R ) disorders in a sample of 18 subjects derived from a TBI rehabilitation programme .
Result	Results revealed high rates for major depression , bipolar affective disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , borderline and avoidant personality disorders .
Result	Co-morbidity was also high .
Result	A preliminary study of postulated predictive factors revealed possible roles for sex and for initial severity of injury .
Result	The study supports the association between TBI and psychiatric disorder , and suggests the need for monitoring , for prevention , and for treatment of psychiatric disorders after TBI .

Background	Idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the hip is a rare condition that was first described in a series women in their third trimester of pregnancy .
Background	The clinical course is usually benign and self-limiting .
Background	Magnetic resonance is very useful for the diagnosis .
Background	Differential diagnoses include avascular necrosis of the femoral head , septic arthritis of the hip , osteomyelitis , stress fractures , primary or secondary neoplastic processes , and referred pain from the spine or genitourinary tract in pregnant women .
Background	The authors present a case of idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the pelvis in a young nonpregnant woman with insidious hip pain with no antecedent infection or trauma .

Background	It has been suggested that the characteristics of alexithymia result from deficits in frontal lobe functioning , and the prefrontal cortex is particularly dependent on the catechol O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) pathway .
Method	We investigated the relationship between COMT Val108/158Met , serotonin transporter coding sequence ( 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region ; 5-HTTLPR ) polymorphisms , and alexithymia.The study sample comprised 109 students at the Korea University .
Method	All participants were tested using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS-20 ) .
Method	They were genotyped for COMT Val108/158Met and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms .
Method	Genotyping was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction .
Result	Subjects with Val/Val genotype had significantly higher TAS-20 scores than those with Met/Met or Met/Val genotypes .
Result	However , there was no significant relationship between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and TAS-20 scores .
Result	This indicates a possible association between the COMT Val108/158Met gene polymorphism and alexithymia .

Background	The potential cardiotoxicity of the doxorubicin-paclitaxel regimen , when paclitaxel is given shortly after the end of the anthracycline infusion , is an issue of concern , as suggested by small single institution Phase II studies .
Method	In a large multicenter Phase III trial , 275 anthracycline naive metastatic breast carcinoma patients were randomized to receive either doxorubicin ( 60 mg/m ( 2 ) ) followed 30 minutes later by paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m ( 2 ) 3-hour infusion ; AT ) or a standard doxorub
Method	Both treatments were given once every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles .
Method	Close cardiac monitoring was implemented in the study design .
Result	Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) occurred in three patients in the AT arm and in one patient in the AC arm ( P = 0.62 ) .
Result	Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction to below the limit of normal were documented in 33 % AT and 19 % AC patients and were not predictive of CHF development .
Result	AT is devoid of excessive cardiac risk among metastatic breast carcinoma patients , when the maximum planned cumulative dose of doxorubicin does not exceed 360 mg/m ( 2 ) .

Background	Central pain following spinal cord injury is poorly understood , and is often resistant to conventional pain therapy regimens .
Background	We describe an individual with paraplegia who for many years experienced rapidly fluctuating , severe , unilateral pain below the level of his lesion .
Background	Prior to the initiation of pharmacological treatment , regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) was measured during PAIN and NON-PAIN states using single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) .
Background	When experiencing pain , the subject had increased anterior cingulate gyrus blood flow , increased thalamic blood flow bilaterally and increased somatosensory cortex blood flow contralaterally but decreased caudate blood flow bilaterally .
Result	The subject 's subsequent clinical course included a trial of gabapentin which produced a substantial reduction in frequency and average intensity of his episodic pain and which has been maintained for almost 2 years .
Result	This case demonstrates the correspondence between rCBF and pain associated with spinal cord injury and also suggests the potential utility of gabapentin for treatment of this central pain state .

Background	An estimated 20 % of all breast cancer or ovarian and breast cancer cases have familial aggregation .
Background	Today it is known that approximately 10 % of these cases are attributable to inherited mutations of a predisposition gene that confers a high risk of developing the disease .
Background	Several genes have been identified that differ in the risks which they determine , the proportion of cases they explain and the other cancers they may cause .
Background	Out of all the genes reported so far , BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most important ones .
Background	The mutations in the remaining genes are rare or involve moderate or low risks .
Background	The possibility to detect breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in high risk families poses serious challenges that must be faced by health professionals related with this field .

Background	To evaluate the prescription of antidepressants in general practice .
Method	Retrospective observational study .
Method	Three health centres and one practice with two partners in the Western part of the Netherlands ( near Leiden ) .
Method	Medication data and daily medical records of general practitioners ( GPs ) were analysed in the anonymous data set of Registratie network universitaire huisartspraktijken Leiden en Omstreken ( RNUH-LEO , with a total of about 23,000 patients ) of patients 18 y
Method	For indication ` depression ' we also evaluated whether the prescription was repeated and a minimal effective dosage was reached .
Result	In one year 218 patients received a first prescription of an antidepressant ( 9/1 ,000 / year ) , mostly a classical antidepressant .
Result	In 61 % the indication ` depression ' was found in the medical records .
Result	Sixty-three per cent had a repeat prescription after one month .
Result	Serotonin reuptake inhibitors were repeated more frequently than classical antidepressants , especially for patients under the age of 65 .
Result	The minimally effective dosage was reached in 61 % of the patients with depression for the classical antidepressants , and for 98 % of patients with serotonin reuptake inhibitors .
Result	Serotonin reuptake inhibitors were not prescribed more frequently than classical antidepressants .
Result	The percentage of patients with repeat prescriptions showed that the GPs should pay continued attention to compliance with therapy when prescribing antidepressants .
Result	The effective dosage appeared to be reached most often with serotonin reuptake inhibitors .

Background	The aim of this study was to describe early occurrences of metastases after laparoscopy of ovarian masses later found to be malignant .
Method	The hospital charts of eight women having undergone laparoscopic surgery for ovarian mass were reviewed and analyzed .
Method	The mean age of the patients was 40 years ( range 25 to 66 ) .
Method	Size of the tumor ranged from 2 to 15 cm .
Method	In four patients the ovarian mass was suspected to be malignant in the laparoscopy .
Method	Diagnostic procedure ( biopsy of the tumor ) was performed in two and salpingo-oophorectomy in six patients .
Method	Staging laparotomy was performed within the mean of 17 days ( range 7-29 ) .
Result	In four patients ( 50 % ) the cancer had spread from a localized to an advanced stage during the delay .
Result	Ascites was present in the laparoscopy in two of the four patients with port site or abdominal wall metastases .
Result	Laparoscopic surgery of ovarian mass later found to be malignant can cause considerable and early spread of the cancer .

Background	To evaluate whether baseline or procedural stress during in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or gamete intrafallopian transfer ( GIFT ) affects pregnancy or live birth delivery rates .
Method	Prospective study .
Method	Patient ( s )
Method	One hundred and fifty-one women completed two questionnaires .
Method	None .
Method	The number of oocytes aspirated and fertilized , the number of embryos transferred , the achievement of a pregnancy , live birth delivery , and infant outcomes .
Result	Positive-affect negative-affect score at baseline negatively influenced the number of oocytes retrieved and embryos transferred .
Result	A higher expectation of pregnancy was associated with greater numbers of oocytes fertilized and embryos transferred .
Result	At baseline , the risk of no live birth was 93 % lower for women who had the highest positive-affect score compared to those with the lowest score .
Result	Furthermore , the score on the Infertility Reaction Scale was related to negative outcomes in live birth delivery , infant birth weight , and multiple births .
Result	During the time of the procedure , the PANAS and Bipolar Profile of Moods States results were related to the number of oocytes fertilized and embryos transferred ; stress did not affect pregnancy or delivery .
Result	Baseline ( acute and chronic ) stress affected biologic end points ( i.e. , number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized ) , as well as pregnancy , live birth delivery , birth weight , and multiple gestations , whereas ( procedural ) stress only influenced biologic end

Background	Clonidine is approved for spinal administration against neuropathic pain , and reverses both spontaneous and elicited pain in humans following spinal administration .
Background	Rodent studies that seek to model pharmacology in pain states have historically relied on reflexive withdrawal from noxious stimuli as the primary endpoint .
Method	Drug self-administration studies have face validity in the drug abuse field for modeling drug abuse in humans , however , this methodology has not been applied to address issues related to drug seeking behaviors that may be relevant for other human populations , such as patients with neuropathic pain .
Result	Rats without spinal nerve ligation ( SNL ) failed to acquire intrathecal clonidine self-administration over 10 days of access .
Result	Rats were found to self-administer intrathecal infusions of clonidine following SNL in a stable and dose-responsive manner , however , and clonidine was self-administered throughout the day with 66 % of total drug intake occurring during the dark cycle .
Result	Substitution of clonidine with saline or with clonidine and the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan resulted in extinction of responding in SNL animals .
Result	Food reinforcement was initially decreased in SNL rats self-administering clonidine compared to normal animals , however , tolerance developed to this effect of clonidine in SNL rats after 5 days .
Result	These data demonstrate that drug self-administration can be applied to questions other than drug abuse , and provides an additional measure for development of novel therapeutic strategies for chronic pain treatment .

Background	Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a common injury among children .
Background	Most TBIs are mild and do not require hospitalization .
Background	However , whether or not the patients require acute hospitalization , TBIs may have long-lasting consequences .
Background	There is little research on the nutrient needs of these patients , and recommendations are frequently based on data from adults with TBI .
Background	It is clear that calorie and protein needs are elevated with acute TBI .
Background	However , calorie needs are also decreased by therapies such as sedation , chemical paralysis , and barbiturate coma .
Background	Long-term calorie needs may be lower for `` comatose '' patients .
Background	Enteral feeding is preferred and possible for patients with TBI , though gastric feeding may be problematic in some patients .
Background	In the acute phase , patients with TBI can also have dysregulation of fluid and electrolyte balance , which may require alterations in nutrition care .
Background	Dysphagia is common after moderately severe TBI and requires a multidisciplinary approach for treatment .
Background	Future opportunities for research on pediatric TBI are numerous and may include ongoing clarification of macronutrient needs , as well as investigation into the roles of specific nutrients such as zinc , antioxidants , and anti-inflammatory compounds .

Background	The stimulant modafinil has proved to be an effective treatment modality for narcolepsy and related sleep disorders and is also being studied for use during sustained military operations to ameliorate the effects of fatigue due to sleep loss .
Background	However , a previous study reported that a relatively large , single dose of modafinil ( 300 mg ) , administered to already sleep-deprived individuals , caused participants to overestimate their cognitive abilities ( i.e. ` overconfidence ' ) .
Method	Because the predominant application of modafinil is in otherwise healthy , non-sleep-deprived individuals , the present study investigated the generality of modafinil-induced overconfidence in a group of 18 healthy , non sleep-deprived adults .
Method	The design involved a double-blind , placebo controlled , fully within-subjects manipulation of placebo and modafinil ( 4 mg/kg : approximately 300 mg , on average ) over three 50-min cognitive testing sessions ( i.e. before drug ingestion , and at 90 and 180 min
Method	The cognitive task battery included subjective assessments of mood , fatigue , affect , vigor and motivation , and cognitive assessments of serial reaction time , logical reasoning , visual comparison , mental addition and vigilance .
Method	In addition , trial-by-trial confidence judgements were obtained for two of the cognitive tasks and more global , task level assessments of performance were obtained for four of the cognitive tasks .
Result	Relative to placebo , modafinil improved fatigue levels , motivation , reaction time and vigilance .
Result	In terms of self-assessments of cognitive performance , both the placebo and modafinil conditions were ` well calibrated ' on trial-by-trial confidence judgements , showing neither marked over - nor under-confidence .
Result	Of note , the modafinil condition displayed a non-significant tendency towards ` overconfidence ' for task-level assessments of performance .
Result	The present findings highlight the need for continued research on the many complex interactions involving fatigue states , occasional versus long-term stimulant use , and subjective assessments of fatigue and cognitive performance .

Background	Preoperative investigations in ovarian cancer have shown that early diagnostic or screening is impossible by means of the leucocyte adherence inhibition test ( LAI-test = LAI ) .
Background	However , this test is important for follow-up studies .
Background	The LAI can be an additional parameter for individual decision .
Background	It in the clinical supervision of patients has been shown that metastasizing and local recurrent tumors can be detected by this test approximately 4-8 weeks before clinical evidence .

Method	In this paper are assessed through ENT-exam , rhinomanometry and cephalometry both bipedal and in dorsal decubitus , the anatomical alterations occurring in the upper airways in 100 consecutive patients , polysomnographically diagnosed of SAOS .
Method	The patients were classified in 4 groups ( after Fujita 's modified classification ) : 2 having oropharyngeal obstruction ( I and IIa ) and other 2 with hypopharyngeal obstruction ( IIb and III ) , which were subdivided in its time with nasal obstruction present (
Result	Group I and IIa ( 68 % ) - theoretical candidates to an uvulopalatopharyngoplasty , UPPP-showed its predominance , followed by a high incidence of nasal obstruction ( N + , 48 % ) and a non negligeable number of hypopharyngeal alterations ( 32 % ) .

Background	The clinician manages trauma patients in the emergency room , operation theatre , intensive care unit and trauma ward with an endeavour to provide best possible treatment for physical injuries .
Background	At the same time , it is equally important to give adequate attention to behavioural and psychological aspects associated with the event .
Background	Knowledge of the predisposing factors and their management helps the clinician to prevent or manage these psychological problems .
Background	Various causes of psychological disturbances in trauma patients have been highlighted .
Background	These include pain , the sudden and unexpected nature of events and the procedures and interventions necessary to resuscitate and stabilise the patient .
Background	The ICU and trauma ward environment , sleep and sensory deprivation , impact of injury on CNS , medications and associated pre-morbid conditions are also significant factors .
Background	Specific problems that concern the traumatised patients are helplessness , humiliation , threat to body image and mental symptoms .
Background	The patients react to these stressors by various defence mechanisms like conservation withdrawal , denial , regression , anger , anxiety and depression .
Background	Some of them develop delirium or even more severe problems like acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder .
Method	Physical , pharmacological or psychological interventions can be performed to prevent or minimise these problems in trauma patients .
Method	These include adequate pain relief , prevention of sensory and sleep deprivation , providing familiar surroundings , careful explanations and reassurance to the patient , psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment whenever required .

Background	We examined the relationships between long-term treatment response , side-effects and drug discontinuation in panic disorder ( PD ) - agoraphobia .
Method	A total of 326 patients were naturalistically treated with antidepressants and followed for a period of 3 years .
Method	All patients were evaluated by means of the Panic Disorder/Agoraphobia Interview and the Longitudinal Interview Follow-up Examination ( LIFE-UP ) .
Result	A total of 179 patients interrupted pharmacological treatment .
Result	Among them , 26.8 % were not traceable ; 36.9 % had deemed further contact with the psychiatrist unnecessary because of remission .
Result	Other reasons for interruption were : ineffectiveness ( 18.4 % ) , side-effects ( 10.6 % ) and personal reasons ( 7.3 % ) .
Result	Patients who interrupted pharmacological treatment because of symptom remission remained in the study for a longer period than those patients who interrupted their treatment because of inefficacy .
Result	In the long-term treatment of PD with antidepressants , a high percentage of patients who have achieved symptom remission tend to default from further treatment ; adherence to long-term treatment with antidepressants was predicted by severe and long-lasting

Background	Endothelial-derived prostacyclin is an important regulator of microvascular function , and its main actions are inhibition of platelet/leukocyte aggregation and adhesion , and vasodilation .
Background	Disturbances in endothelial integrity following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) may result in insufficient prostacyclin production and participate in the pathophysiological sequelae of brain injury .
Method	The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of a low-dose prostacyclin infusion on cortical lesion volume , CA3 neuron survival and functional outcome following TBI in the rat .
Method	Anesthetized animals ( sodium pentobarbital , 60 mg/kg , i.p. ) were subjected to a lateral fluid percussion brain injury ( 2.5 atm ) or sham injury .
Method	Following TBI , animals were randomized to receive a constant infusion of either prostacyclin ( 1 ng/kg x min ( -1 ) i.v. ) or vehicle over 48 h.
Method	All sham animals received vehicle ( n = 6 ) .
Method	Evaluation of neuromotor function , lesion volume , and CA3 neuronal loss was performed blindly .
Result	By 7 days postinjury , cortical lesion volume was significantly reduced by 43 % in the prostacyclin-treated group as compared to the vehicle treated group ( p < 0.01 ; n = 12 prostacyclin , n = 12 vehicle ) .
Result	No differences were observed in neuromotor function ( 48 h and 7 days following TBI ) , or in hippocampal cell loss ( 7 days following TBI ) between the prostacyclin - and vehicle-treated groups .
Result	We conclude that prostacyclin in a low dose reduces loss of neocortical neurons following TBI and may be a potential clinical therapeutic agent to reduce neuronal cell death associated with brain trauma .

Method	The contribution of the striatum to category learning was examined by having patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and matched controls solve categorization problems in which the optimal rule was linear or nonlinear using the perceptual categorization ta
Method	Traditional accuracy-based analyses , as well as quantitative model-based analyses were performed .
Background	Unlike accuracy-based analyses , the model-based analyses allow one to quantify and separate the effects of categorization rule learning from variability in the trial-by-trial application of the participant 's rule .
Result	When the categorization rule was linear , PD patients showed no accuracy , categorization rule learning , or rule application variability deficits .
Result	Categorization accuracy for the PD patients was associated with their performance on a test believed to be sensitive to frontal lobe functioning .
Result	In contrast , when the categorization rule was nonlinear , the PD patients showed accuracy , categorization rule learning , and rule application variability deficits .
Result	Furthermore , categorization accuracy was not associated with performance on the test of frontal lobe functioning .
Result	Implications for neuropsychological theories of categorization learning are discussed .

Background	Using a model of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) in the rat , this study was undertaken to characterize the short-term biochemical changes of IL-1beta , IL-10 , and tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha to determine whether injury in the brain elicits a systemic cyto
Method	Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a TBI using a weight-drop model and then killed at various time points after injury .
Method	Samples of blood , brain , and liver were recovered and analyzed for concentrations of IL-1beta , IL-10 , and TNF-alpha as well as IL-1beta and IL-10 mRNA expression in liver and brain .
Result	In brain , IL-1beta increased in the first hour after injury , peaked at 8 hours , and declined during the final 16 hours .
Result	IL-10 quickly increased during the first 4 hours and then gradually rose over the last 20 hours .
Result	Analysis of liver showed no upregulation of these markers and plasma IL-1beta and IL-10 were unchanged compared with controls .
Result	Although not upregulated in brain , TNF-alpha showed a statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) rise in plasma from 14 + / - 16 pg/mL at 20 minutes to 91 + / - 28 pg/mL at 24 hours .
Result	Using a model of TBI , we have demonstrated that there is a rise in both IL-1beta and IL-10 in the injured rat brain within the first 24 hours after injury without a corresponding rise in either plasma or liver .
Result	Therefore , it appears as if two strong indicators of brain injury severity are expressed and possibly carry out their actions solely in the brain .

Background	Obesity and type 2 diabetes are world wide health issues and their incidence is rapidly increasing .
Background	Currently the biological factors responsible for the development of obesity are only partially understood .
Background	Recent research has shown that maternal nutrition during pregnancy may have long-term metabolic consequences in offspring .
Method	In the present study we investigated interactions between prenatal and postnatal nutrition on leptin sensitivity and obesity development .
Method	Wistar rats were time-mated and randomly assigned to either ad-libitum ( AD ) or to 30 % of ad-libitum ( UN ) food intake throughout pregnancy .
Method	After weaning , female offspring were fed standard chow , a high-fat diet or a calorie restricted diet .
Result	Female offspring of UN dams were growth retarded at birth and showed increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity on a high-fat diet .
Result	At 142 + / - 5 days of age , leptin sensitivity was measured as a response to 14 days of leptin treatment ( 2.5 microg/g/day , s.c. ) .
Result	In UN offspring fed chow , leptin treatment failed to reduce food intake and weight loss was diminished .
Result	This leptin resistance observed in UN offspring was independent of diet-induced obesity and was associated with fasting hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia .
Result	Our study suggests that prenatal nutrition can shape future susceptibility to obesity through alterations in leptin sensitivity and changes in energy metabolism during adult life .

Background	We have recently demonstrated that following a moderate contusion spinal cord injury ( SCI ) to rats , subsequent administration of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) significantly enhances functional recovery and tissue sparing .
Background	To further characterize the effects of bFGF , we evaluated its efficacy after a more severe contusion injury at T ( 10 ) using the NYU impactor .
Method	Immediately after SCI , osmotic minipumps were implanted into the lateral ventricle and lumbar thecal sac to deliver bFGF at 3 or 6 microg per day versus control vehicle for 1 week .
Method	Animals were behaviorally tested for 6 weeks before histological assessment of tissue sparing through the injured segment and glial reactivity distal to the lesion .
Result	Compared to moderate SCI , all rats had more prolonged and sustained functional deficits 6 weeks after severe contusion .
Result	Subjects treated with bFGF had pronounced recovery of hindlimb movements from 2 to 6 weeks compared to controls , manifested in significantly higher behavioral scores .
Result	Only marginal tissue sparing was seen rostral to the injury in bFGF-treated spinal cords versus controls .
Result	Optical density measurements of astrocyte and microglial cell immunoreactivity in bFGF-treated spinal cords showed that after 6 weeks they approximated controls , although astrocyte immunoreactivity remained higher in controls rostrally .
Result	In summary , intrathecal infusion of bFGF following severe SCI significantly restores gross hindlimb motor function that is not correlated with significant tissue sparing .
Result	In light of previous evidence that pharmacological intervention with bFGF after moderate SCI enhances tissue preservation , the current findings indicate that yet undefined mechanisms contribute to the enhanced functional recovery following bFGF treatment .

Background	Nerves leave the spinal cord as mainly motor primary rootlets and sensory rootlets .
Background	These join to nerve root before leaving the spinal canal .
Background	After the root canal , the nerve root branches into the ventral root , which contains sensory and motor fibers innervating the extremities , and the dorsal root , that is , the dorsal ramus , which innervates the posterior structures , for example , back muscles :
Background	Especially predisposed to entrapment is the medial branch of the dorsal ramus , which innervates the multifidus muscle and also contains pain fibers .
Method	Here we describe the influence of local anesthesia and back-muscle-training therapy on subjective and objective pain parameters in 21 low-back-pain patients who had similar clinical status and neurophysiologic findings and whose recurrent low back pain wa
Result	After treatment , all were pain free and back muscle activity during lumbar-pelvic rhythm was normalized .

Background	We report the case of a 19-year-old woman who consulted for low-back pain 3 weeks after her first delivery .
Background	This young woman had a personal history of protein C deficiency and was treated daily during her pregnancy with low-molecular-weight heparin .
Background	Her body mass index was 34 and she only gained 10 kg during her pregnancy .
Background	Since the delivery - which occurred without any complication - she had suffered from a gradually increasing right-buttock pain and limp .
Method	Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) revealed a fracture of the right sacral ala. .
Result	After analgesia and 1 month of home relative bed rest , the patient recovered her functional capacities .
Result	Regarding our patient , who had no potential clinical risk factors for osteoporosis , the causal effect of heparin is thus possible but not certain .
Result	This case report illustrates the fact that clinicians should have a high suspicion of pelvic fracture in post-partum women , even in very young ones , presenting sudden onset of low back and pelvic pain , especially when they have received heparin during pre
Result	MRI seems to be the key exam because it is able to detect and stage fractures or microfractures .

Background	Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism ( PE ) .
Background	Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clot more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE .
Background	However , there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy , such as major or minor haemorrhages .
Method	To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE .
Method	We sought trials through the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group 's Specialised Register ( January 18 , 2006 ) , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( The Cochrane Library Issue 1 , 2006 ) , MEDLINE ( January 1966 to December 2004 ) , EMBASE , CINAHL , LILACS and SCISEARCH ( all November 2004 ) .
Method	We also searched individual trial collections and private databases , along with bibliographies of relevant articles .
Method	Relevant medical journals were handsearched .
Method	The most recent search was on February 6 , 2006 .
Method	Randomised controlled trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo or heparin or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE .
Method	We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug .
Method	Two authors ( DB and WQ ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data .
Result	Results were similar between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin in terms of : a ) death rate : odds ratio ( OR ) 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.45 to 1.78 ; b ) recurrence of pulmonary embolism : OR 0.63 ; 95 % CI 0.33 to 1.20 ; c )
Result	We can not conclude whether thrombolytic therapy is better than heparin for pulmonary embolism based on the limited evidence found .
Result	More double-blind RCTs , with subgroup analysis of patients presenting with haemodynamically stable acute pulmonary embolism compared to those patients with a haemodynamic unstable condition , are required .

Background	The increased resistance of better-educated individuals to the cognitive effects of neuropathology has been conceptualized as reflecting brain reserve .
Background	This study examined whether educational level influences the degree of neuropsychological impairment associated with late-life depression .
Method	The neuropsychological performances of 115 older depressed patients and of 44 comparison subjects of similar age and education were compared as a function of educational level .
Result	While depressed patients performed worse than comparison subjects on all the measures , the severity of this impairment ( with respect to comparison subjects ) did not differ with the educational level of the patients .
Result	Brain reserve , as indexed by the patients ' level of education , does not mitigate the cognitive decrements associated with late-life depression .

Background	The occurrence of pelvic insufficiency fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has not previously been well emphasized .
Background	These fractures are difficult to detect clinically , and appropriate radiological investigation is necessary for diagnosis .
Background	A 72-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented with severe left groin pain .
Background	Pelvic radiographs showed parasymphyseal fractures , and marked instability of these fractures was observed at the follow-up 2 weeks later .
Background	Computed tomographic scan of the sacrum showed a widened linear fracture gap in the left sacral ala. .
Method	Because the patient 's pain was so severe that she could not change position , external fixation was performed to achieve rapid pain relief and early mobilization .
Result	Although most patients with these fractures respond well to simple conservative treatments , parasymphyseal fractures combined with sacral fractures may cause disruption of the pelvic ring and occasionally need operative management .

Background	Sympathetic benefits of thoracoscopic cardiac resynchronization therapy ( TCRT ) in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) are unknown .
Background	We determined cardiac hemodynamics , functional status , and muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) in a group of TCRT patients .
Method	We aimed to compare these patients with CHF patients with cardiac asynchrony ( ASY ) to substantiate the beneficial effects of TCRT .
Method	Eleven patients resynchronized by TCRT 6 + / - 1 months before study inclusion ( SYN ) and 10 matched ASY patients underwent blood pressure , heart rate , and MSNA recordings .
Method	All underwent functional status , cardiac index , and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assessments .
Result	SYN patients had shorter QRS duration and interventricular mechanical delays , longer 6 minute walking distance and lower New York Heart Association class ( all P < .05 ) than ASY patients .
Result	MSNA of 56 + / - 2 bursts/min in ASY patients was higher than in SYN patients ( 48 + / - 3 bursts/min , P < .05 ) .
Result	Cardiac index was higher in SYN patients than in ASY patients ( 2.8 + / - 0.2 versus 1.9 + / - 0.2 L.min.m2 , P < .05 , respectively ) .
Result	MSNA was highest in the patients with the lowest LVEF ( r = -0.49 , P < .05 ) , cardiac index ( r = -0.48 , P < .05 ) and 6-minute walking distance ( r = -0.50 , P < .05 ) .
Result	Lower sympathetic nerve activities in TCRT patients are related to more favorable cardiac indexes and six minute walking distances suggesting a sympathetic , hemodynamic , and functional improvement by TCRT .

Background	Animal laboratory studies have demonstrated that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) has fetotoxic and teratogenic effects at low doses .
Background	TCDD contamination of soil in nine residential areas of eastern Missouri began in 1971 when several horse arenas and dirt roads were sprayed for dust control with a mixture that contained waste oil and dioxin .
Background	The authors conducted an epidemiologic investigation to determine if adverse human reproductive outcomes are associated with exposure to soil contaminated with dioxin .
Method	The authors attempted to identify all births during the period of January 1 , 1972 through December 31 , 1982 that had potential exposure to dioxin , based on proximity of the maternal address to a location of known TCDD contamination .
Method	This group totaled 410 births .
Method	A matched set of 820 unexposed births was selected as a comparison group after being matched for maternal age and race , year of birth , hospital of birth , and plurality .
Result	The exposed group had increased risk ratios for infant , fetal , and perinatal death ; low birth weight ; and several subcategories of birth defects .
Result	None of these increased risk ratios for the exposed group were statistically significant .
Result	These results do not provide evidence that TCDD exposure has a substantial impact on the reproductive outcomes investigated .
Result	If TCDD does produce effects on reproductive health , a larger study and/or better measures of exposure may be needed to discover them .

Background	To observe the effect and safety of one-stage single balloon multiple expansions percutaneous kyphoplasty ( PKP ) in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture ( OVCF ) and spinal tumor .
Method	One-stage single balloon multiple expansions PKP was performed on 18 patients , 5 males and 13 females , aged 68.77 ( 44 - 80 ) , with 45 vertebrae , including 11 case of OVCF ( with 29 diseased vertebrae ) , 11 cases of multiple vertebral fracture ( with 19 diseas
Method	Pain relief and functional recovery were evaluated with visual analogue pain scale ( VAS ) and Oswestry disability index ( ODI ) scaling , and restoration of vertebral height and Cobb angle were evaluated by X-ray examination .
Method	Follow-up was conducted by telephone survey or clinic consults for 12.3 months ( 6 - 18 months ) .
Result	Operation was successfully performed on all patients with an operative time of 29.3 min ( 55 - 127 min ) per vertebra .
Result	The average pressure of the balloon expansion was 165 Psi ( 87 - 210 Psi ) , and the average balloon expanded volume was 3.25 ml ( 1.5 - 4 ml ) .
Result	A balloon was expanded 2 approximately 5 times in one operation with the average of 2.94 expanded times .
Result	The bone cement volume injected was 3.95 ml ( 2 - 8.5 ml ) per vertebra .
Result	Epidural cement leakage was seen in 1 vertebra in 1 case and paraspinal leakage was seen in two vertebrae in 1 case .
Result	The VAS and ODI scoring of these patients were both decreased significantly after operation .
Result	Both the anterior height and midline height of vertebrae were significantly improved .
Result	The pain relief and functional recovery were substantial and maintained to the last follow-up without any re-collapse or adjacent level fracture .
Result	one-stage single balloon multiple expansions PKP is effective , economic and safe in treatment of multi-level OVCF and spinal tumor .

Method	The relation between physical activity and health among retired people aged 65 and over was studied in a sample of 993 subjects , men and women , living at home in the Paris area and randomly selected from a pension fund roll .
Method	In 1982-1983 ( T1 ) , 627 subjects were interviewed .
Method	Five years later ( T2 ) , 464 subjects participated in the survey .
Method	Health was measured by the number and types of impairments and disability .
Result	The incidence of cardiorespiratory impairment and the incidence of disability were weaker among subjects with physical activity in T1 than among subjects without physical activity .
Result	These findings were unchanged after adjustment for age , sex , socioeconomic status , cigarette smoking , body mass index , uncomfortable housing , living alone and hard physical conditions during working life .
Result	This result suggests the beneficial effect of physical activity in promoting health among retired people aged 65 and over .

Background	Flavonoids are present in fruits , vegetables and beverages derived from plants , and in many dietary supplements or herbal remedies .
Background	A number of naturally occurring flavonoids have been shown to modulate the CYP450 system , including the induction or inhibition of these enzymes .
Method	This review focuses on the flavonoid effects on cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme CYP1 , 2E1 , 3A4 and 19 .
Result	Flavonoids alter CYPs by various mechanisms , including the stimulation of gene expression via specific receptors and/or CYP protein , or mRNA stabilization and so on .
Result	But in vivo and in vitro , the effects of flavonoids are not always coincident as a result of concentrations of flavonoids , genetic and environmental factors .
Result	As well , flavonoids may interact with drugs through the induction or inhibition of their metabolism .
Result	Much attention should be paid to the metabolism interaction of the flavonoids when coadministered with other drugs .

Method	We studied the respiratory muscles with magnetic transcranial stimulation ( TCS ) in four spinal cord injured ( SCI ) patients as compared to age-matched controls from a database of 40 healthy subjects .
Background	These SCI patients all had spinal cord lesions above C6 level with a clinically incomplete tetraplegia .
Background	One patient was artificially ventilated .
Method	Motor evoked potentials ( MEPs ) were recorded from the diaphragm , the scalenes , the parasternal intercostals and the expiratory rectus abdominis during inspiration and expiration .
Result	In patients with incomplete tetraplegia MEP latency times were significantly prolonged in the scalenes and the parasternal intercostals , both during inspiration and expiration , and were nearly normal for the diaphragm , which was found to be more or less p
Result	The mean MEP amplitudes in these patients for all inspiratory muscles studied were significantly decreased in tetraplegic patients , in part due to a decreased number of innervating axons and muscle hypotrophy .
Result	No MEPs could be obtained from the abdominal muscles , except in one C3 tetraplegic patient , in whom only a very small response was seen during expiration , with a very delayed latency time .
Result	The much lower location of their innervating nerve roots ( T10 ) and the much longer distance of their spinal exit zone from the level of injury at the cervical spinal cord might at least partially explain this phenomenon .
Result	In the ventilator-dependent tetraplegic patient no MEPs could be obtained from any of the muscles studied .
Result	Thus , magnetic TCS is a painless and easily applicable technique to investigate the central motor conduction properties of the respiratory muscles , both in healthy humans and in tetraplegic patients .

Background	Perrow 's models of organizational technologies provide a framework for analyzing clinical work processes and identifying the management structures and informatics tools to support each model .
Background	From this perspective , health care is a mixed model in which knowledge workers require flexible management and a variety of informatics tools .
Background	A Venn diagram representing the content of clinical decisions shows that uncertainties in the components of clinical decisions largely determine which type of clinical work process is in play at a given moment .
Background	By reducing uncertainties in clinical decisions , informatics tools can support the appropriate implementation of knowledge and free clinicians to use their creativity where patients require new or unique interventions .
Background	Outside health care , information technologies have made possible breakthrough strategies for business success that would otherwise have been impossible .
Background	Can health informatics work similar magic and help health care agencies fulfill their social mission while establishing sound business practices ?
Background	One way to do this would be through personalized health care .
Background	Extensive data collected from patients could be aggregated and analyzed to support better decisions for the care of individual patients as well as provide projections of the need for health services for strategic and tactical planning .
Background	By making excellent care for each patient possible , reducing the `` inventory '' of little-needed services , and targeting resources to population needs , informatics can offer a route to the `` promised land '' of adequate resources and high-qu

Background	This study examines the effects of a low-intensity walking program on the quality of life in patients with Crohn 's disease .
Method	Patients were randomized into exercise and nonexercise groups for a prospective study .
Method	Patients were recruited at the inflammatory bowel disease outpatient clinic at the London Health Science Center , London , Ontario .
Method	Thirty-two adult patients met the inclusion criteria of ( 1 ) mildly active disease or disease in remission , ( 2 ) habitual physical activity of less than 2 times per week of vigorous activity , ( 3 ) not anticipating change of dose or type of medication for Cro
Method	All 32 patients who entered the study completed the 3-month study .
Method	Patients performed low-intensity walking at an interval of 3 times per week for a duration of 3 months .
Method	Each walking session lasted for 30 minutes .
Method	The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire , the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Stress Index , and the Harvey-Bradshaw Simple Index were used as outcome .
Method	Survey measurements were recorded at 1-month intervals on commencement of the walking program .
Result	Patients in the exercise group experienced a statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) improvement in quality of life in all 3 of the outcome measurement questionnaires with no detrimental effects in terms of disease activity .
Result	A low-intensity walking program may have a beneficial effect in patients with Crohn 's disease and improve their quality of life with no exacerbations in disease symptoms .

Method	A prospective study was designed to follow patients with syndromes of brain stem during 12 months ( in 1991-1992 ) .
Background	The aim was to correlate clinical and radiologic findings and comparing them with the classical descriptions of brain stem syndromes .
Method	Twenty one consecutive patients were admitted at the Hospital de Base do Distrito Federal .
Method	The diagnosis and the follow up were carried out by neurological examination and neuroradiologic images CT ( 100 % ) , angiography ( 24 % , 5 ) and MRI ( 5 % , 1 ) .
Result	Hypertension and old age were the most important risk factors and hemorrhage at pons with extension to midbrain was the most frequent finding .
Result	Coma at admission was associated to a poor outcome .
Result	The outcome was defined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale : 28 % rated 5 , 24 % rated 4 , 5 % rated 3 , 28 % rated 2 and 14 % rated 1 .
Result	Our results show that the clinical presentation of ischemic strokes and hemorrhages of the brain stem very frequently follow a mixed pattern , which do not conciliate with the classical of these syndromes .

Background	We studied if the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates are maintained after their discontinuation , and whether adverse effects may develop .
Method	Seventeen children in whom I.V. bisphosphonates were discontinued for at least 12 months were included .
Method	Fracture rate ( FR ) , skeletal pain , bone mineral density of total body ( TB ) and spine L ( 2-4 ) , skeletal radiographs , bone markers and kidney functions were compared between ( a ) before treatment , ( b ) end of treatment , and ( c ) last follow-up .
Method	Mean treatment duration was 22 + / -2 months ( 6-43 ) and follow-up 26 + / -2 months ( 18-44 ) .
Result	FR ( mean + / - SD ) decreased from 0.74 + / -0.21 / year before treatment to 0.35 + / -0.11 / year after treatment and 0.20 + / -0.09 / year at follow-up ( p < 0.05 ) .
Result	Three children had bone pain before treatment , six during treatment and none at end of follow-up ( p < 0.05 ) .
Result	TB Z-score increased from -1.24 + / -0.50 at baseline to -0.37 + / -0.44 at end of treatment and -0.39 + / -0.37 at follow-up ( p < 0.05 ) .
Result	Spinal Z-score increased from -1.65 + / -0.57 to -0.34 + / -0.56 and 0.19 + / -0.49 , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .
Result	Bone turnover markers showed sustained effect of bisphosphonates .
Result	No adverse effects on kidney functions or skeletal radiographs were noted .
Result	We conclude that I.V. bisphosphonates continue to exert their beneficial effect for a mean of 26 + / -2 months after their discontinuation ; therefore , once therapeutic goals are achieved , the medication can be withheld , followed by periodic re-evaluation .

Background	We present a 59-year-old man with a dilated cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction = 20 % ) , congestive heart failure and atrio-ventricular ( AV ) block who underwent implantation of a biventricular defibrillator ( BiV ICD ) .
Background	While undergoing cardiac transplant evaluation for drug-refractory ventricular fibrillation , his telemetry recorded findings resembling crosstalk inhibition .
Result	Device interrogation was normal .
Result	All episodes occurred at 1:00 a.m. suggesting a routine device operation .
Result	Left ventricular capture management , a new feature that automatically measures left ventricular pacing thresholds at 1:00 a.m. , had been programmed to Monitor .
Result	Understanding this sophisticated pacing algorithm might avoid confusion when operative in patients with AV block .

Background	Epidemiologic evidence suggests a positive association between body mass , adult height , and postmenopausal breast cancer .
Method	However , most studies have not been large enough to examine the association across a very wide range of body mass or height , and few studies have assessed the relationship between body mass or height and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality .
Method	The relation between body mass index ( BMI ) and height and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality was examined in the American Cancer Society 's Cancer Prevention Study II ( CPS-II ) , a large prospective mortality study of US adults enrolled in 1982 .
Method	After 14 years of follow-up , 2852 breast cancer deaths were observed among 424,168 postmenopausal women who were cancer-free at interview .
Method	Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate relative risks and to control for potential confounding .
Result	Breast cancer mortality rates increased continually and substantially with increasing BMI ( rate ratio ( RR ) = 3.08 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 2.09-4 .51 for BMI > 40.0 compared to BMI 18.5-20 .49 ) .
Result	If causal , the multivariate-adjusted RR estimates in this study correspond to approximately 30-50 % of breast cancer deaths among postmenopausal women in the US population being attributable to overweight .
Result	Breast cancer mortality also increased with increasing height up to 66 inches with RR = 1.64 , ( 95 % CI = 1.23-2 .18 ) in women 66 inches tall compared to those < 60 inches .
Result	Postmenopausal obesity is an important and potentially avoidable predictor of fatal breast cancer in this study .
Result	These results underscore the importance of maintaining moderate weight throughout adult life .

Background	A multicascade of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions is involved in the trafficking of inflammatory lymphocytes into tissue .
Background	The primary contact between leukocytes and endothelium is mediated by selectins .
Background	Ligands for P-Selectin are preferentially expressed on Th1 cells and thereby allow migration of these inflammatory cells through the vessel wall .
Method	Since a peripheral and local Th1-type cytokine profile is present in spontaneous human abortion ( SA ) , opposed by a Th2 dominant situation in normal pregnancies ( NP ) , we investigated ( 1 ) the phenotype of peripheral Th1 cells by flow cytometry , as well as t
Method	We observed enhanced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in CD8 ( + ) , CD3 ( + ) , and CD56 ( + ) blood cells , as well as an increase in the number of CCR5 ( + ) cells in patients suffering from SA compared to those with NP .
Result	No difference was detectable with respect to the serum levels of the two cytokines .
Result	Using IHC methods , we observed increased staining intensity of P-Selectin ( + ) vessels in samples of SA patients .
Result	E-Selectin was only weakly expressed in decidual endothelial cells , with no difference between NP and SA .
Result	In SA samples , E-Selectin ( + ) stromal cells were exclusively present .
Result	We further detected increased numbers of decidual CD8 ( + ) , CD3 ( + ) , CCR5 ( + ) , and CD56 ( + ) cells in SA patients .
Result	We propose that Th1 lymphocyte migration into decidua is enhanced in SA due to upregulated P-Selectin expression in decidual vessels .
Result	This increase of Th1-producing lymphocytes might be involved in the rejection of trophoblasts .

Background	Emerging evidence indicates an association between cognitive function and physical performance in late life .
Background	This study examines the relationship between cognitive function and subsequent gait speed decline among high-functioning older adults .
Method	Measures of global cognitive function ( Modified Mini Mental State Examination [ 3MS ] ) and executive control function ( ECF ) ( a clock drawing task [ CLOX 1 ] and the 15-item Executive Interview [ EXIT 15 ] ) were obtained in the Health , Aging , and Body Composition Study in 1999-2000 .
Method	Gait-speed ( meters/second ) was assessed over 20 meters at usual pace .
Method	Using a mixed model , we assessed the relationship between baseline cognitive function and gait-speed change over 3 years .
Method	Two thousand , three hundred forty-nine older adults ( mean age 75.6 + / - 2.9 years ) completed the assessments .
Result	After adjustment for baseline gait speed , a 1-standard-deviation ( SD ) lower performance on each cognitive test was associated with greater gait-speed decline over 3 years : 0.016 m/s for the 3MS ( SD = 8.1 ) , 0.009 m/s for CLOX 1 ( SD = 2.4 ) , and 0.012 m/s fo
Result	After adjustment for comorbidities , the effect size was attenuated for 3MS and CLOX 1 , and the association for EXIT 15 was no longer significant .
Result	Depression score was most strongly associated with the EXIT 15 effect reduction .
Result	Global and executive cognitive functions predict declines in gait speed .
Result	The association of ECF with gait speed decline is attenuated by comorbid conditions , particularly depression .
Result	Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these associations may point to new pathways for the treatment of physical decline associated with diminished cognitive function .

Background	Fatty acid deficiency symptoms ( FADS ) of dry hair and skin , frequent thirst and urination have been observed to be higher in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Method	Two studies investigated FADS in 7-12-year-old children ; Study 1 in a general population ( N = 347 ) and Study 2 in children with ADHD symptoms ( N = 104 ) .
Result	Correlations between FADS and ADHD-related symptoms were found at baseline in Study 1 but not Study 2 .
Result	FADS did not improve after supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) versus placebo after 15 weeks in Study 2 , and were not related to improvements in ADHD symptoms in the PUFA groups .
Result	However , FADS did improve in all groups , possibly attributable to the linoleic acid present in both the PUFA and placebo ( palm oil ) supplements .
Result	FADS are not a reliable selection criterion for children with ADHD who might benefit from omega-3 PUFA supplementation .

Background	To evaluate the association between physical activity and the morphological , functional and physiological components of physical fitness in postmenopausal women .
Method	A cross-sectional study of 162 postmenopausal women , 40-65 years of age , who verbally responded to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire applied to evaluate their level of physical activity .
Method	Physical fitness was evaluated by measuring body mass index , waist circumference , body fat percentage , maximum oxygen consumption , plasma levels of total and fractional cholesterol , triglycerides and fasting glucose , as well as blood pressure .
Result	Approximately 83.5 % of the women were active , principal physical activities being household chores and transportation walking .
Result	Approximately 80 % of the women were overweight or obese and presented a waist circumference indicative of high or very high risk for cardiovascular disease , and fat percentage above 33 % .
Result	Over 50 % were found to have low oxygen consumption .
Result	There were no significant differences between the groups of active and inactive women with respect to mean body mass index ( p = 0.43 ) , percentage of body fat ( p = 0.60 ) , hip-to-waist ratio ( p = 0.93 ) , waist circumference ( p = 0.44 ) , maximum VO2 ( p = 0.32 )
Result	Adjusted prevalence ratios also showed no significant differences between the groups .
Result	Habitual physical activity is not associated with variations in the components that are used to describe physical fitness .
Result	It is important to encourage physical activity and provide guidelines to ensure that it is carried out in the quantity , duration and intensity required for improving physical fitness level and obtaining health benefits .

Background	Colon cancer with a synchronous ovarian metastasis is occasionally diagnosed at the time of laparotomy for a pelvic mass .
Background	The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical presentation as well as the impact of the type of metastatic spread and surgical intervention on overall survival.We reviewed charts of 23 patients treated between 1980 and 1995 .
Method	Pain was the initial symptom in 14 patients ( 61 % ) , with only four patients ( 17 % ) complaining of rectal bleeding , but with five patients ( 22 % ) complaining of uterine bleeding .
Method	At the time of laparotomy , the ovarian capsule was intact in 12 patients .
Result	Metastatic disease to the peritoneum was seen in seven patients and to the liver in six patients .
Result	On pathological evaluation , the median ovarian tumor size was 10 cm , significantly larger than the median colon tumor size of 4.5 cm .
Result	Surgical treatment consisted of colon resection in all but one patient , bilateral or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 22 patients , and hysterectomy in nine patients .
Result	Only one patient survived 5 years .
Result	Sixteen patients died of colon cancer .
Result	The median survival time was 17.8 months , ranging from 1 to 86 months .
Result	Tumor size was of no prognostic importance .
Result	Median survival time of patients with peritoneal disease ( 10.8 months ) was significantly shorter compared to patients without peritoneal disease ( 25.2 months ) .
Result	In the presence of liver metastasis , the median survival time was , likewise , significantly reduced from 20.1 months to 8.1 months.In conclusion , macroscopic metastatic disease to the ovary is a poor prognostic factor in colon cancer .
Result	In selected patients who can be rendered disease-free by surgery , prolonged survival is possible and an aggressive approach is recommended .
Result	Survival of patients with peritoneal disease or liver metastasis is short and a mainly palliative approach is recommended .

Method	Thirty-two patients with colorectal cancer , eleven with gastric cancer and two with pancreatic cancer were treated by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy from March 1988 to December 1999 .
Method	A single administration of 5-FU , MMC and epirubicin ( FAM group ) , or intermittent continuous infusion of 5-FU 500 mg/2 h ( 5-FU continuous group ) was used for each patient once a week .
Result	Overall survival rates were not significantly different between the gastric and colorectal cancer patients .
Result	In patients with colorectal cancer , there was a significant prolongation in overall survival for the response group .
Result	With gastric cancer , however , there was no significant difference .
Result	For both of the two patients with pancreatic cancer , although they were responsive to the therapy , there was no prolongation of survival .
Result	In conclusion , intermittent continuous infusion was more effective for the patients with colorectal cancer .
Result	In patients with gastric and pancreatic cancer , hepatic intra-arterial infusion could control the progression of liver metastasis .

Background	The use of spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) for chronic intractable anginal pain was first described in 1987 .
Background	Numerous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving exercise tolerance , decreasing frequency of anginal episodes , and prolonging time to electrocardiographic signs of ischemia .
Method	This review will examine the potential mechanisms of this antianginal effect and propose a unified hypothesis explaining it .
Background	The effect of SCS involves a mutual interaction of decreased pain , decreased sympathetic tone , and a likely redistribution of myocardial blood flow to ischemic regions .
Background	Spinal cord stimulation reduces the transmission of nociceptive impulse via the spinothalamic tract due to an enhanced release of gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) from dorsal horn interneurons .
Result	Improvement of myocardial blood flow at the microvascular level has been demonstrated by positron emission tomography ( PET ) .
Result	A decreased sympathetic tone has been shown by norepinephrine kinetics , tests of sympathetic reflexes , and the use of ganglionic blockers .
Result	We hypothesize that SCS exerts its beneficial effects by decreasing pain and decreasing sympathetic tone , the result of which is decreased myocardial oxygen consumption along with an improved myocardial microcirculatory blood flow .

Background	Glucocorticoids ( GCs ) inhibit bone formation in vivo .
Background	In MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts , chronic administration of 1 microm dexamethasone ( DEX ) starting at confluency results in > 98 % inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( BMP-2 ) expression and apatite mineral deposition .
Method	Here , it is shown that brief exposure to recombinant human BMP-2 ( rhBMP-2 ) , as short as 6 h , is sufficient to induce irreversible commitment to mineralization in DEX-treated cultures .
Result	RhBMP-2 dose dependently rescued mineralization but not collagen accumulation in DEX-inhibited cultures .
Result	The selective restoration of mineralization was evident in the higher mineral to matrix ratios of DEX/rhBMP -2 co-treated cultures compared with control .
Result	We tested the involvement of the runt-related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) in the DEX inhibition and rhBMP-2 rescue of mineralization .
Result	Surprisingly , DEX did not decrease Runx2 DNA binding activity , transactivation , or association with the endogenous osteocalcin gene promoter .
Result	Furthermore , the rhBMP-2 rescue did not involve Runx2 stimulation , suggesting an important role for factors other than Runx2 in BMP-2 action .
Result	Finally , we studied the differentiation-related cell cycle , which persists during commitment to mineralization in untreated cultures , but is inhibited along with mineralization in DEX-treated cultures .
Result	Although both rhBMP-2 alone and DEX alone were antimitogenic , rhBMP-2 stimulated this cell cycle in DEX-inhibited cultures .
Result	In conclusion , brief rhBMP-2 treatment restores mineralization in DEX-inhibited MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts via a mechanism different from Runx2 stimulation .
Result	This restoration may be functionally related to the accompanying rescue of the differentiation-related cell cycle .
Result	The efficacy of short term BMP-2 treatment supports the potential of short-lived BMP vectors for skeletal therapy in both traditional and gene therapeutic approaches .

Background	Bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice for hypercalcaemia of malignancy ( HCM ) but there is no consensus regarding which drug or dose should be given .
Method	We designed a systematic review to investigate the efficacy of bisphosphonates in the treatment of HCM .
Method	We identified randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) by searching electronic databases , scanning of reference lists , and consultation with experts and pharmaceutical companies .
Method	Foreign papers were translated .
Method	Inclusion criteria were RCTs , confirmed malignant disease and measurement of serum calcium ( ionized or corrected for albumin ) postrehydration .
Method	The primary outcome was number of patients achieving normocalcaemia .
Method	Secondary outcomes were time to normocalcaemia , time to relapse and toxicity .
Result	Twenty-seven papers and two abstracts , using intravenous bisphosphonates , fulfilled the inclusion criteria .
Result	Data from 26 studies were used in analyses .
Result	Due to the heterogeneity of studies , meta-analysis could not be performed .
Result	Pamidronate was more effective than placebo , mithramycin , etidronate ( 7.5 mg/kg ) and low-dose clodronate ( 600 mg ) , but equal to higher dose clodronate ( 1500 mg ) .
Result	Clodronate and etidronate were superior to placebo ; incadronate was superior to elcatonin ; gallium nitrate was superior to etidronate .
Result	No difference was seen between alendronate and clodronate .
Result	Three dose finding studies showed no difference between 30-90 mg of pamidronate , but one well designed study showed increasing efficacy with increasing dose .
Result	Studies using increasing doses of ibandronate ( 0.6-4 mg ) , alendronate ( 2.5-15 mg ) , and incadronate ( 2.5-10mg ) , showed a dose response .
Result	Duration of administration of pamidronate did not affect efficacy ( six studies ) .
Result	Bisphosphonates normalize calcium in > 70 % patients with minimal side effects .
Result	Aminobisphosphonates are most effective at maintaining normocalcaemia and should be given in high dose irrespective of baseline serum calcium .

Background	We compared the tolerability and clinical efficacy of tolterodine with those of oxybutynin in patients with an overactive bladder using an upward oxybutynin dose titration strategy analogous to that used in routine clinical practice in the United Kingdom
Method	In a randomized double-blind trial 378 male and female patients 50 years old or older with symptoms of overactive bladder ( a urinary frequency of 8 or more voids per 24 hours with urgency and/or urge incontinence , that is 1 or more urge incontinence episo
Method	The main outcome measures were changes in voiding diary variables combined with detailed tolerability-safety assessments .
Result	Patients treated with tolterodine had significantly fewer adverse events ( 69 % versus 81 % , p = 0.01 ) , notably dry mouth ( 37 % versus 61 % , p < 0.0001 ) , as well as a lower incidence of dose reduction ( 6 % versus 25 % , p < 0.0001 ) than those in the oxybutyni
Result	Each agent had comparable efficacy for improving urinary symptoms .
Result	Tolterodine and oxybutynin caused a significant decrease ( p = 0.0001 ) in the mean number of voids per 24 hours ( -1.7 or -15 % and -1.7 or -15 % , respectively ) , urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours ( -1.3 or -54 % and -1.8 or -62 % , respectively ) and mean vo
Result	Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin for improving the symptoms of overactive bladder but it has superior tolerability .
Result	The combination of these qualities makes tolterodine the preferred pharmacological therapy for the long-term treatment of this condition .

Background	To investigate the factors influencing the choice of treatment for ectopic pregnancy and to compare the subsequent fertility rates of radical , conservative-surgical or medical treatments .
Method	Population-based study of 835 ectopic pregnancies registered between 1992 and 1996 .
Method	Auvergne Ectopic Pregnancy Register ( France ) .
Method	Four hundred and seventy-six women with tubal ectopic pregnancy who were not using contraception at the time of conception .
Method	Subsequent fertility was studied for the 291 women who attempted to conceive again .
Method	Comparison of reproductive outcomes according to ectopic pregnancy treatment .
Method	Cumulative fertility curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared by log rank test for univariate analysis and by Cox regression to take into account confounding variables .
Method	Recurrence and fertility rates after ectopic pregnancy .
Method	The first treatment given was ` radical ' for 178 women ( 37 % ) , ` conservative-surgical ' for 262 ( 55 % ) , and ` medical ' for 35 ( 8 % ) .
Result	The treatment failed in 1 % for radical treatment , 5 % for conservative-surgical treatment , and 36 % for medical treatment .
Result	The two-year cumulative rate of recurrence was 27 % with no significant difference between treatments .
Result	For women with previous infertility factors ( in particular diseased contralateral tube ) , the treatments differed significantly , with the rate of intrauterine pregnancy lower for radical treatment and higher for medical treatment than for conservative-surg
Result	For women with no infertility factor , there was no significant difference between treatments .
Result	These results should be confirmed in a controlled trial .
Result	The results of this study provide the elements necessary to plan such a trial .

Background	Impaired recall is a common consequence of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
Background	Predicting recall during learning is a critical part of self-monitoring .
Method	Adults with TBI and noninjured controls made recall predictions of noun pairs that varied in prediction timing ( immediate , delayed ) , and predictions of narrative information that varied in salience ( main idea and details ) and explicitness ( stated and impl
Result	For both groups , delayed recall predictions for noun pairs and stated ( narrative ) information were relatively accurate , whereas immediate recall predictions of noun pairs and delayed predictions of implied information were relatively inaccurate .
Result	Both groups were more confident making predictions of stated information than implied information .
Result	Neither predictive accuracy nor confidence generalized across tasks .
Result	Working memory load across tasks and individual differences are proposed explanations .
Result	The lack of generalization highlights the need to train domain or task-specific self-monitoring .

Background	The decrease in heart rate variability ( HRV ) might be related to the hemodynamic status in heart failure .
Background	However , HRV in patients with severe isolated right heart failure has not been extensively studied .
Method	This study compared HRV in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and in patients with isolated right heart failure .
Method	Time and frequency domain analysis of HRV on 24-h ECG recording was assessed in 15 healthy subjects and in two groups of patients with severe heart failure awaiting heart or heart/lung transplantation .
Method	These were 15 patients with CHF due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( IDC ) and 10 patients with isolated right heart failure due to primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH ) .
Result	Measurement of HRV were significantly decreased in both groups of patients compared with the control group .
Result	Patients with IDC had higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure than patients with PPH ( P = 0.04 ) but lower pulmonary artery pressure and lower pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) ( P < 0.0001 ) .
Result	However , all the measurements of HRV were significantly lower in patients with IDC than in patients with PPH ( range 22-77 % , P < 0.05 to P < 0.01 ) .
Result	None of the HRV measurements correlated with filling pressure measurements .
Result	The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in heart failure is not the main causal factor behind a decrease in HRV .

Method	Objectives
Background	To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Body Image Scale ( originally designed for use in cancer ) in women with benign gynaecological conditions .
Method	Prospective completion of the Body Image Scale by women participating in the EVALUATE Hysterectomy Trial .
Method	The scale was completed pre-operatively , then 6 weeks , 4 and 12 months post-operatively .
Method	The psychometric properties were evaluated by assessing the reliability , response prevalence , discriminant validity and sensitivity to change .
Method	Factor analysis was also conducted to determine the scale structure .
Result	The Body Image Scale showed good reliability and clinical validity .
Result	Differences between sub-groups of women were detected , demonstrating good discriminant validity .
Result	The Body Image Scale was shown to be responsive to changes in body image .
Result	The Body Image Scale was shown to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing body image in women with benign gynaecological conditions and for use in clinical trials involving such women .

Background	Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive multisystem disorder , which occurs mainly in European-derived populations .
Background	The incidence of CF varies between 1 in 2000 to 3000 live-births in various ethnic groups .
Background	The disease is rare in East Asians .
Method	Here we report a 9 year old Thai male patient , who was diagnosed to have CF based on recurrent pneumonia , a slow weight gain , pancreatic insufficiency and repeatedly elevated sweat chloride levels by two different methods .
Result	A comprehensive genetic analysis showed the splicing mutation , 1898 + 1G -- > T , which was apparently of maternal origin .
Result	Literature search found 39 documented cases of CF patients in East Asians .
Result	CFTR ( MIM # 602421 ) genotyping was performed in 14 patients including our patient and in 9 of them a CF allele was identified .
Result	The findings seem to indicate that the splicing mutations , 1898 + 1G -- > T and 1898 + 5G -- > T are more common in East Asian CF patients .

Background	Epidural analgesia is a pharmacological technique for operative and postoperative pain control .
Background	It has been used with lumbar microdiscectomy to facilitate management of surgical pain , shorten patient recovery time , and increase patient satisfaction with the procedure and the hospital stay .
Background	Adcon-L ( Gliatech , Inc. , Cleveland , OH ) ( adhesion control in a barrier gel ) has been demonstrated to act as a barrier to the development of epidural fibrosis after lumbar procedures , minimizing the formation of fibrotic scar and improving the long-term ou
Method	In this study , we used Adcon-L as a vehicle to administer 1 mg of morphine epidurally to patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy .
Method	Our objective was to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of this compound .
Method	A randomized , controlled , double-blind study was conducted in 100 patients .
Method	Patients were randomized to two groups : the morphine-Adcon-L ( M-ADL ) group ( n = 51 patients ) or the Adcon-L control group ( n = 49 patients ) .
Method	Outcome measures included 1 ) a visual analog scale to assess the intensity of spontaneous low back and radicular pain , 2 ) a straight leg-raising maneuver to assess the degree of leg elevation in relation to evoked sciatic pain , 3 ) postoperative time to comfortable walking , 4 ) duration of postoperative hospitalization , 5 ) required amount of postoperative analgesics , and 6 ) postoperative work time loss .
Result	No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed .
Result	No clinically relevant adverse events , such as urinary retention , respiratory disturbances , or wound infections were reported in the M-ADL group .
Result	At the time of hospital discharge , results were as follows : 1 ) the M-ADL group had significantly lower pain intensity scores ( mean value of postoperative visual analog scale , 12.3 mm + / - 0.9 in the M-ADL group versus 24.7 mm + / - 11.5 in the control group [
Result	In addition , at 1 year of follow-up , there was no clinical evidence of late-onset neurological complications .
Result	The epidural application of the compound M-ADL after lumbar microdiscectomy was found to be safe and effective , and it significantly improved postoperative pain control and return to function .

Method	To determine the incidence and characteristics of prostate cancer in men with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .
Background	Little is known about the characteristics of prostate cancer in men with SCI , because prostate cancer screening is not aggressively performed in this population .
Method	In one fiscal year , 648 men with SCI older than age 50 years were actively enrolled with the SCI service , 20,949 able-bodied men older than age 50 years were actively enrolled in the outpatient clinic database , and 945 patients with prostate cancer were i
Method	These three databases were cross-referenced for prostate cancer diagnosis and stage and compared with the presence of SCI .
Result	Of the 648 patients with SCI , 12 patients with a prostate cancer diagnosis that preceded their injury were excluded .
Result	Of the remaining 636 patients , 11 ( 1.7 % ) had been diagnosed with prostate cancer since their injury .
Result	In contrast , of the 20,949 able-bodied men older than age 50 years seen at our facility in fiscal year 1999 , 919 ( 4.4 % ) had prostate cancer .
Result	Of the patients with SCI and prostate cancer , 7 ( 63.6 % ) had locally advanced ( Stage T3 ) or metastatic prostate cancer compared with 267 ( 29.1 % ) in the able-bodied population ( P = 0.012 ) .
Result	Although the proportion of patients with a prostate cancer diagnosis was greater in the able-bodied patients , the prostate cancer detected in the patients with SCI tended to be of a more advanced stage and grade .
Result	The difference was likely a result of the decreased use of prostate cancer screening in this population .

Background	To evaluate surgical management of the fracture of the ring of axis ( FRA ) , known as `` hangman 's fracture '' , and to discuss adequacy of this treatment .
Method	Between 1994 and 2004 , 41 patients with FRA were surgically treated in our hospital.We present a retrospective study of 30 cases treated by anterior cervical fixation and fusion and 11 cases treated by a posterior , CT-guided approach ( published recently ) .
Method	Our diagnostic algorithm for evaluation of FRA included plain radiographs for basic diagnosis , detailed CT scan , MRI and finally passive lateral flexion-extension fluoroscopy ( performed by physician ) to assess stability.We also consider discography in sel
Method	Fractures were classified according to Levine .
Method	Posterior compressive osteosynthesis according to Judet was performed in 11 patients with Levine type I fractures with fracture fragment distraction > 3 mm .
Method	Anterior graft and plate fixation was chosen in 30 patients with type II ( 25 patients ) and type I ( 5 patients ) fractures where C2/3 disc injury was confirmed by MRI or discography .
Method	There was no case of facet dislocation in our series ( type III ) .
Method	Pain , motion restriction and overall satisfaction with neck status were assessed on a scale 1-5 ( 1 = best ) in patients treated with anterior approach .
Method	Self-evaluation questionnaires were administered during follow-up ( average , 7.3 years ; 24 months to 11 years ) .
Result	Anatomically reduced fracture fusion was achieved in all cases ( 100 % ) at one year follow-up .
Result	Both autologous tricortical ( 22 ) and fibular allografts ( 8 ) were used for anterior approach .
Result	No perioperative complications occurred and no case was aborted .
Result	Average hospital stay in patients with standalone FRA was 6.8 days ( 3-15 ) .
Result	Patients wore Philadelphia collar for 4-6 weeks .
Result	One patient died during follow up due to unrelated causes .
Result	None of the 29 patients treated with the anterior approach reported severe or very severe pain ( grades 4 or 5 ) .
Result	The average pain score was 1.28 .
Result	Three patients with isolated FRAs reported slight subjective restriction of movement ( grade 2 ) .
Result	The `` satisfaction with overall neck status '' scale showed an average score of 1.62 , never worse than grade 2 .
Result	Despite increasing popularity of anterior surgical approach in the treatment of type II FRA , most authors still recommend conservative treatment .
Result	Surgical treatment is consensually recommended in type III fractures only .
Result	Type I is treated exclusively conservatively .
Result	There is currently no evidence-based data supporting any method of treatment of so called `` hangman 's fracture '' .
Result	The majority of treating surgeons do not consider the status of the intervertebral disc .
Result	Dynamic films , simulating the peak point of injury , are usually not performed .
Result	Hence , potentially unstable fractures are overlooked .
Result	This also explains the lack of long term follow-up data regarding the radiological status of C2/3 intervertebral disc as well as patients ' subjective complaints .
Result	Surgery provides plausible results .
Result	Compared to conservative treatment , it can offer significant benefits : 1 ) immediate , better and stable reposition ; 2 ) high fusion rate ; 3 ) shortening of the treatment period with better quality of life .
Result	Contrary to conservative treatment modalities , surgery possesses a potential for further development .

Background	The potential use of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists has been the subject of a number of recent reviews .
Background	Despite the promises of better things to come , few new compounds have been identified that circumvent the issues hindering the widespread use of the previously described nicotinic analgesics , mainly a narrow therapeutic window between analgesic efficacy a
Background	However , several recent developments have potentially opened new windows of opportunity in the use of nicotinic agents for analgesia .
Result	A small number of laboratories have reported that peripheral nerve injury alters the pharmacology of nicotinic receptors , resulting in a leftward shift of analgesic potency but not of toxicity .
Result	Another important development in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is the reliance of nerve injury-induced behavioural hypersensitivity on both peripheral and central neural immune interactions .
Result	Finally , the reported neuroprotective effects of nicotine following spinal cord injury may provide an opportunity for the development of selective nicotinic agonists that are capable of attenuating chronic pain .
Result	The current review will attempt to highlight these recent developments and outline key findings that demonstrate further opportunity for the development of nicotinic agonists as novel analgesics .

Background	Spinal hematoma is a rare and potentially catastrophic complication of spinal or epidural anesthesia .
Background	Risk factors include traumatic needle/catheter placement , sustained anticoagulation in an indwelling neuraxial catheter , and catheter removal during therapeutic levels of anticoagulation .
Background	Generally , a patient 's coagulation status should be optimized at the time of spinal or epidural needle/catheter placement , and the level of anticoagulation should be monitored during epidural catheterization .
Background	Signs of cord compression , such as severe back pain , progression of numbness or weakness , and bowel and bladder dysfunction , warrant immediate radiographic evaluation .
Background	A delay in diagnosis and intervention of spinal hematoma may lead to irreversible cord ischemia .

Background	To investigate whether left atrial appendage outflow velocity alone or in relation to left atrial diameter is a superior predictor of sinus rhythm maintenance after cardioversion compared with traditional clinical or echocardiography parameters .
Method	Sixty-two patients with their first episode of atrial fibrillation were examined using echocardiography before DC-cardioversion .
Method	At one month 's follow-up , 42 patients had maintained sinus rhythm ( group A ) , and 20 had relapsed into atrial fibrillation ( group B ) .
Method	There were no differences in arrhythmia duration or antiarrhythmic therapy between the groups .
Result	Left atrial diameter measured by echocardiography was smaller in group A ( 42 mm , 95 % CI 40.9-44 .1 mm ) compared with group B ( 46 mm , 95 % CI 43.4-48 .2 , p < 0.05 ) .
Result	Patients in group A had a higher left atrial appendage outflow velocity at 0.44 m/s ( 95 % CI 0.39-0 .49 ) compared with 0.34 m/s ( 95 % CI 0.30-0 .37 ) in group B ( p < 0.01 ) .
Result	The ratio of left atrial appendage flow to left atrial diameter was 0.011 ( 95 % CI 0.009-0 .012 ) in group A compared with 0.008 ( 95 % CI 0.007-0 .009 ) in group B , and 63 % ( 95 % CI 33-78 ) of the patients in group A had velocity ratio > 0.009 compared with 20 % ( 9
Result	Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a velocity ratio > 0.009 was the only predictor for maintenance of sinus rhythm one month after cardioversion with an odds ratio of 6.4 ( 95 % CI 1.9-23 .8 ) , ( p = 0.004 ) .
Result	The ratio of left atrial appendage outflow velocity to left atrial diameter is superior to the traditionally used criteria for prediction of maintenance of sinus rhythm following DC-conversion of first-episode atrial fibrillation .

Background	Global cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is common , with some abilities more significantly affected than others .
Background	However , due to difficulties in estimating premorbid intelligence , there has been no systematic evaluation of the extent of decline in different cognitive abilities following TBI .
Background	Recent studies indicate that the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised ( WRAT-R ) Reading subtest is an accurate estimate of premorbid intelligence , suggesting that post-TBI cognitive test scores can be compared to the WRAT-R to estimate the extent of decline
Method	The current study estimated the extent of deficit in intelligence , memory , attention , speed of processing , and cognitive flexibility for 97 outpatients with TBI .
Method	Extent of decline was calculated by subtracting WRAT-R z-scores from cognitive test z-scores to determine a z-difference score ( ZDiff ) for each cognitive ability .
Result	The results suggest that intelligence is least declined following TBI ( WAIS-R 3-4-point decline ; VIQ ZDiff = -0.23 : FIQ ZDiff = -0.27 ) , followed by attention ( WMS-R 5-point decline ; ZDiff = -0.31 ) , memory ( WMS-R 6-9-point decline ; Verbal Memory ZDiff = -0

Background	Whereas the effect of interferons ( IFNs ) on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) outcome measures in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) has been convincingly shown , little work has been done to define the between-patient heterogeneity of treatment response
Method	Our aim was to assess the distribution of the effect of IFNbeta-1b in terms of reduction of active T2 lesions in patients with MS.
Method	Using a fixed and a random effects model , we investigated the distribution of active T2 lesions reduction over a three-year follow up in response to treatment with 250 mcg IFNbeta-1b every other day in 695 patients with a complete MRI data-set of the 718
Result	The two statistical models consistently showed that the between-patient response to IFNbeta-1b , in terms of reduction of active T2 lesions , is highly heterogeneous .
Result	Whereas treated patients have a high probability ( more than 65 % ) of showing an active T2 lesion reduction equal to or greater than 60 % , there is also a 7 % probability for treated patients not to show any reduction of MRI-detected disease activity during t
Result	This study might be regarded as a first step toward the definition of markers potentially useful to identify IFNbeta treatment responders and non-responders with regard to T2 lesion activity .

Background	Dialysis patients have an inordinate risk of cardiovascular events .
Background	Fish oils , rich in n-3 fatty acids , are believed to be beneficial in the prevention of atherosclerosis and thrombosis .
Background	Hence , the use of fish oils deserves consideration as a preventative or therapeutic intervention in dialysis patients .
Background	The suggestion has been made that n-3 fatty acids could increase the risk of bleeding , and thus , the safety of the use of these agents in dialysis patients must be established before long-term studies are undertaken .
Background	This study addresses the effect of n-3 fatty acids on the hemostatic profile of dialysis patients .
Method	Sixteen patients on chronic dialysis therapy were randomized to fish oil ( MaxEPA ) or placebo ( olive oil ) in a double-blind cross-over study .
Method	They received 3.6 g of n-3 fatty acids for 4 wk .
Result	Bleeding times were 4.8 + / - 0.4 min on MaxEPA and 4.5 + / - 0.3 min on placebo .
Result	Platelet aggregation to low-dose ADP or collagen also remained unchanged .
Result	There was a trend to lower serum triglyceride levels ( 2.7 + / - 0.5 versus 3.4 + / - 0.6 mmol/L , fish oil versus placebo ) that did not reach statistical significance .
Result	Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 10 of the 16 subjects and were severe in 5 patients .
Result	These side effects occurred in both the olive oil and the fish oil groups .
Result	The study had a 95 % chance of detecting a clinically doubling significant increase in bleeding time , i.e. , beta error less than 5 % .
Result	In conclusion , n-3 fatty acids do not introduce a clinically important risk of bleeding for patients with end-stage renal disease .

Background	To compare the onset of symptomatic urinary tract infection in individuals with spinal cord injury in a rehabilitation setting who are randomized to clean or sterile intermittent catheterization technique .
Method	Randomized controlled design .
Method	Spinal cord rehabilitation units in western Canada .
Method	Thirty-six patients with cervical spinal cord injuries requiring intermittent catheterization by nursing staff were recruited .
Method	None had a previous history of voiding dysfunction or urinary tract infections .
Method	Interventions
Method	Subjects were randomized to either clean or sterile intermittent catheterization technique .
Method	Protocols for both clean and sterile techniques were standardized and followed by nursing staff and caregivers .
Method	Primary outcome measure was symptomatic urinary tract infection as diagnosed by urine culture > or = 10 ( 5 ) colony-forming units/mL , pyuria ( > or = 10 leukocytes on high-power field ) , and accompanying symptoms .
Result	A total of 189 urine specimens from 36 subjects were cultured .
Result	Of the 36 subjects , 15 ( 43 % ) developed a symptomatic urinary tract infection : 6/16 ( 37 % ) from the clean group ; 9/20 ( 45 % ) from the sterile group ( P > 0.05 ) .
Result	Mean time to onset for symptomatic urinary tract infection for the clean group was 3.0 ( standard deviation ( SD ) 2.4 ) weeks and for the sterile group , 3.6 ( SD 1.3 ) weeks ( P > 0.05 ) .
Result	The most common urinary organisms at onset of symptomatic urinary tract infection were Enterococcus species followed by Klebsiella .
Result	Clean intermittent catheterization in the rehabilitation setting does not appear to place the patient with spinal cord injury at increased risk for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection , and has significant cost and time saving benefits for the h

Background	Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) produces a tissue-specific decrease in protein levels of microtubule-associated protein 2 ( MAP2 ) , an important cross-linking component of the neuronal cytoskeleton .
Background	Because moderate brain hypothermia ( 30 degrees C ) reduces certain neurobehavioral deficits produced by TBI , we examined the efficacy of moderate hypothermia ( 30 degrees C ) in reversing the TBI-induced loss of MAP2 protein .
Method	Naive , sham-injured , and moderate ( 2.1 atm ) fluid percussion-injured rats were assessed for MAP2 protein content 3 h post injury using quantitative immunoreactivity measurements .
Method	Parallel groups of sham-injured and fluid percussion-injured animals were maintained in moderate hypothermia ( 30 degrees C ) , as measured by temporalis muscle temperature , for MAP2 quantitation 3 h post injury .
Result	No difference in MAP2 levels was observed between naive and sham-injured normothermic animals .
Result	Hypothermia alone had no effect on soluble MAP2 levels in sham-injured animals compared with normothermic sham-injured controls ( 88.0 + / - 7.3 % ; p > 0.10 ) .
Result	Fluid percussion injury dramatically reduced MAP2 levels in the normothermic group ( 44.3 + / - 5.9 % ; p < 0.0005 ) compared with normothermic sham-injured controls .
Result	No significant reduction of MAP2 was seen in the hypothermic injured group ( 95.2 + / - 4.6 % ; compared with hypothermic sham-injured controls , p > 0.20 ) .
Result	Although it is premature to infer any causal link , the data suggest that the attenuation of injury-induced MAP2 loss by hypothermia may contribute to its overall neuroprotective action .

Background	To present a successful outcome of an IVF cycle complicated by failure to produce a sperm sample on the morning of oocyte retrieval .
Method	Case report .
Method	Hospital-based IVF clinic .
Method	A couple suffering secondary infertility undergoing their first IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) cycle .
Method	Fine-needle testicular biopsy for sperm retrieval .
Method	Sperm retrieval , fertilization , pregnancy .
Result	Sufficient spermatozoa were obtained for ICSI .
Result	Ten metaphase II oocytes were injected with two embryos being transferred fresh and four cryopreserved .
Result	A single fetal heart was confirmed at 6-week sonar .
Result	Testicular aspiration of sperm for ICSI is a simple , inexpensive , and effective means of rescuing an IVF cycle in which the male partner unexpectedly has been unable to produce a sperm sample on the morning of oocyte collection .

Method	Continuous 72-h recordings of duodenojejunal contractile activity were obtained from 20 freely ambulant subjects ; pressure was detected by two strain-gauge sensors incorporated in a transnasal catheter attached to an encoder and a miniature tape recorder .
Method	The subjects were 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome , 6 of whom were constipation predominant and 6 of whom were diarrhea predominant , and 8 healthy controls .
Method	The procedure was well tolerated by all subjects and did not interfere with sleep or normal activity .
Result	In all subjects , the diurnal migrating motor complex cycle was characterized by a brief phase 1 and a prolonged phase 2 ; this was reversed during sleep when phase 2 was virtually absent .
Result	All subjects showed a circadian variation in migrating motor complex propagation velocity , and there was no difference in the patterns of motor activity during sleep between any of the groups .
Result	During the day , the duration of postprandial motor activity was shorter in irritable bowel syndrome patients than in controls , and diurnal migrating motor complex intervals were shorter in diarrhea-predominant than in constipation-predominant irritable bo
Result	In 11 of 12 inflammatory bowel syndrome patients , episodes of clustered contractions recurring at 0.9-min intervals were noted ; these episodes had a mean duration of 46 min and were often associated with transient abdominal pain and discomfort .
Result	In both groups of irritable bowel syndrome patients , defecation was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) prolonged with a greater number of voluntary abdominal contractions ( p less than 0.01 ) than in controls .
Result	Prolonged ambulant monitoring of proximal bowel motor activity in subjects who are free to move , eat , and sleep as they choose has , for the first time , clearly defined the striking difference in motility between the sleeping and waking state and shown tha

Background	Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a sensory neuropathy that affects thousands of cancer patients each year as paclitaxel is commonly used to treat breast , non-small cell lung and ovarian cancer .
Background	To begin to define the type and location of sensory neurons most impacted by paclitaxel , we examined rat trigeminal ganglion , thoracic and lumbar dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) 10 days following intravenous infusion of clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel .
Method	To define the population of cells injured by paclitaxel , we examined the expression of activating transcription factor-3 ( ATF3 ) , a marker of cell injury ; to define the hypertrophy of satellite cells , we quantified the expression of the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) ; and to define the activation of macrophages , we examined the expression of the lysosomal protein CD68 .
Result	Intravenous infusion of paclitaxel induced a significant increase of ATF3 in mainly but not exclusively large and medium sensory neurons in all sensory ganglia .
Result	An increase in both GFAP immunofluorescence in satellite cells and the number of activated macrophages occurred in lumbar > thoracic > trigeminal ganglia of paclitaxel-treated rats .
Result	This differential expression of cellular markers suggests that the largest sensory cell bodies with the longest axons are the most at risk of being injured by paclitaxel ( size and length dependent pathology ) .
Result	These results provide a pathological basis for the anatomical distribution of paclitaxel-induced symptoms in patients receiving therapeutic regimens of paclitaxel .

Method	The expression of nitric oxide synthase in neurons of the gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) after experimental spinal cord injury ( SCI ) was assessed in adult rats contused at T8 .
Method	One day and 10 weeks after injury , specimens along the GIT were studied for NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry .
Result	A significant increase in the number of positive cell bodies and fibers in the myenteric plexus were observed 1 day after SCI , as compared to specimens from control and chronically injured rats , with the exception of the colon , which showed unchanged or d
Result	Positive neurons in the submucous plexus remained unchanged , excepting an increase in the colon after acute SCI , and a decrease in the duodenum in chronically injured rats .
Result	The altered nitric oxide neurotransmission in the GIT may be relevant to its reduced motility after SCI .

Background	A 56-year-old patient suffered intractable radicular pain from spondylolisthesis L5/S1 .
Background	There was no help from PLIT-fusion but pain decreased substantially by spinal cord stimulation with a PISCES-system .
Background	On Nov 8th 1987 the battery exhausted gradually whereas the patient increased the output up to maximum .
Background	When changing to a new battery he suffered an electric shock .
Result	Acute opistonus with a jump from his wheelchair occurred with maximal innervation of the muscles of his left leg resulting in a comminuted fracture of his left acetabulum .
Result	There seems to be a need for more information and precautions on involuntary overstimulation in the use of neurostimulators .

Background	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a condition characterized by progressive airflow limitation and decline in lung function .
Background	As seen in other developed countries throughout the world , COPD in the U.K is associated with considerable mortality , and morbidity from the disease places a significant burden on the healthcare system and society .
Background	Despite the obvious burden of COPD in this country , there is a lack of recognition of COPD among the general public .
Background	Healthcare professionals may also fail to recognize the burden of disease , as shown by underdiagnosis and inadequate managemen .
Background	A key step in increasing awareness of the burden of COPD is obtaining comprehensive information about the impact of the disease on patients , the health service and society .
Background	The large-scale international survey , Confronting COPD in North America and Europe , aimed to address this need for information , by interviewing patients and physicians in eight countries .
Result	An economic analysis of patient responses to the survey in the U.K showed that COPD places a high burden on the healthcare system and society with annual direct costs estimated at pounds 819.42 per patient , and indirect cost at pound 819.66 per patient re
Result	The cost impact of the disease was particularly marked in secondary care , as a result of inpatient hospitalizations , amounting to 54 % of direct costs .
Result	These results suggest that reducing patient requirement for hospital care could alleviate the burden of COPD on the U.K. healthcare system .
Result	This will require considerable improvements to the way the disease is managed by healthcare professionals in primary care , with earlier diagnosis and the use of interventions aimed at preventing exacerbations and delaying the progression of disease .

Background	The proper function of peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) catheters can be compromised by catheter malposition , fibrin clot , or omental wrapping .
Background	The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of laparoscopy in the treatment of malfunctioning PD catheters .
Method	All patients undergoing laparoscopy for catheter dysfunction at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland , Ohio , from 1991 to 1995 , were reviewed .
Result	Twenty-six laparoscopies were performed in 22 patients , for malfunction occurring an average of 3.9 months following insertion ( range 0.5-18 months ) .
Result	Omental and/or small below wrapping as present in all but three cases .
Result	Lysis of adhesions was required in 19 of 26 cases , with repositioning only in seven .
Result	Eight patients had failed attempts at stiff wire manipulation prior to laparoscopy .
Result	Perioperative complications occurred in seven cases , consisting of temporary dialysate leakage ( 2 ) , enterotomy ( 1 ) , and early reocclusion ( 4 ) .
Result	Repeat laparoscopy was successful in three of these four reocclusions .
Result	The overall success rate ( catheter function > 30 days after laparoscopy ) was 21/22 ( 96 % ) .
Result	Laparoscopy is highly accurate and effective in the management of peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction and results in prolongation of catheter life .

Background	To determine whether preoperative assessments carried out by appropriately trained nurses are inferior in quality to those carried out by preregistration house officers .
Method	Randomised controlled equivalence/non-inferiority trial .
Method	Four NHS hospitals in three trusts .
Method	Three of the four were teaching hospitals .
Method	All patients attending for assessment before general anaesthesia for general , vascular , urological , or breast surgery between April 1998 and March 1999 .
Method	Assessment by one of three appropriately trained nurses or by one of several preregistration house officers .
Method	History taken , physical examination , and investigations ordered .
Method	Measures evaluated by a specialist registrar in anaesthetics and placed in four categories correct , overassessment , underassessment not affecting management , and underassessment possibly affecting management ( primary outcome ) .
Result	1907 patients were randomised , and 1874 completed the study ; 926 were assessed by house officers and 948 by nurses .
Result	Overall 121/948 ( 13 % ) assessments carried out by nurses were judged to have possibly affected management compared with 138/926 ( 15 % ) of those performed by house officers .
Result	Nurses were judged to be non-inferior to house officers in assessment , although there was variation among them in terms of the quality of history taking .

Background	The serotonin 5-HT ( 2C ) receptor ( HTR2C ) helps regulate appetite and body weight .
Background	An HTR2C promoter polymorphism ( -759 C/T ) has been associated with obesity and with weight gain in response to antipsychotic ( neuroleptic ) drugs .
Method	We studied this polymorphism in 120 obese women ( BMI > or = 30 ) and 104 non-obese ( BMI < or = 25 ) women .
Method	The C allele was commoner in the obese group ( OR = 1.72 [ 95 % CI , 1.13-2 .64 ] , P = 0.008 ) .
Method	Ninety-five of the obese women participated in a randomized trial of psychological treatments for weight loss .
Result	Among these women , heterozygotes lost less weight during the trial than did homozygotes ( 6.8 vs. 9.7 kg ; P = 0.047 ) and weighed more 6 months ( 90.1 vs. 83.6 kg ; P = 0.006 ) and 12 months ( 91.8 vs. 84.6 kg ; P = 0.009 ) later .
Result	Heterozygotes also had higher triglyceride levels than homozygotes .
Result	C/C subjects in the obesity trial did not differ from T/T subjects in terms of weight loss or triglycerides .
Result	In a separate RT-PCR study of 43 subjects , we found that HTR2C mRNA abundance in frontal cortex was unaffected by -759 C/T status .
Result	Our data extend the evidence that HTR2C promoter variation may be a risk factor for obesity and , perhaps through heterosis , influences weight loss by obese women .
Result	Pharmacogenetic testing of HTR2C promoter variants may be valuable when evaluating anti-obesity drugs which act directly or indirectly on the receptor .

Background	Despite the high lifetime prevalence of depression in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , its longitudinal course is poorly understood .
Method	To examine the longitudinal course of and reliable change in different depression symptom clusters in MS , and the longitudinal association of interferon beta treatment and coping with depression symptoms .
Method	53 MS patients were examined at two time points three years apart on the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) and the Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory ( CMDI ) .
Result	Correlations from time 1 to time 2 for BDI , CMDI-total , CMDI-evaluative scale , and CMDI-vegetative scale were all highly significant , and reliable change indices reflected little change over time .
Result	In contrast , the correlation over time for the CMDI-mood scale was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than the CMDI-evaluative and CMDI-vegetative scale correlations , and over 40 % of patients showed reliable change .
Result	Patients who improved in their mood showed increased use of active coping , while patients who worsened showed decreased active coping strategies ; the latter were also significantly more likely to have been taking interferon beta drugs at both time points
Result	Mood symptoms of depression are significantly more variable over time than neurovegetative or negative evaluative symptoms in MS patients .
Result	Decreased use of active coping strategies may put patients at risk of increased depressed mood , whereas increased use of active coping may result in decreased depressed mood longitudinally .
Result	Interferon beta use may put patients at risk of increases in depressed mood .

Background	A 56-year-old man presented with intermittent rectal bleeding of six months ' duration .
Background	Colonoscopy revealed three left colon polyps , one of which harbored adenocarcinoma .
Method	Endoscopic mucosal resection ( band-assisted colonoscopic polypectomy ) was successful .
Result	Endoscopic ultrasonography did not demonstrate any local or regional spread ; however , abdominal computed tomography ( CT ) scan raised suspicion of an isolated metastasis to the liver .
Background	The patient 's mother had recently died from metastatic colorectal cancer .
Background	When presented with the options of no surgery , postendoscopic mucosal resection , and CT-directed needle biopsy of the suspected isolated metastasis to the liver versus segmental resection of the flat adenoma site and wedge resection of the liver lesion fo
Result	Histopathology revealed no evidence of malignancy in the rectosigmoid colon , pericolonic lymph , or liver specimen .
Result	Awareness of increased risk of early cancer in flat adenomas with central depression is important because prompt recognition can lead to curative therapy .

Background	The reasons for a different incidence of osteoporotic fractures in white and black women are unknown .
Background	Previous racial comparisons of bone mass have been limited by racial differences in body weight and socioeconomic , health , and nutritional status .
Method	This cross-sectional study examined bone density in 105 black and 114 white healthy nonobese women , 24-65 yr old , using dual photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and single photon absorptiometry of the distal radius .
Result	Bone density at both sites was higher in blacks at all ages than in whites .
Result	When adjusted for age and body mass index , mean bone density was 6.5 % higher in blacks at both spine and radius ( P less than 0.0001 ) .
Result	The cross-sectional rate of decline of vertebral bone density was similar between races ; however , radial density increased 3.8 % / decade ( P = 0.03 ) in premenopausal blacks under age 46 yr , while it declined 3.2 % / decade ( P = 0.09 ) in premenopausal whites .
Result	The racial difference in slopes in these premenopausal women is significant ( P = 0.002 ) .
Result	These findings suggest that attainment of higher peak bone mass and delayed onset of bone loss contribute to the lower incidence of osteoporotic fractures in black women .

Background	The Medicare Alzheimer Disease Demonstration tested a case management and community care benefit for persons with dementia .
Result	The demonstration produced statistically but not clinically significant reductions in caregiver burden and depression .
Result	It increased access to community-based long-term care services but did not affect the level of services used .
Result	It did not reduce informal caregiver hours spent helping people with dementia .
Result	It produced statistically significant but not budget-neutral reductions in Medicare expenditures in that the degree of reduction in regular Medicare expenditures was not enough to offset the added demonstration costs .
Result	It did not reduce rates of nursing home placement .
Result	Informal care networks providing care to demented enrollees were generally able to function effectively , regardless of whether a professional case manager was involved or whether a long-term care benefit was available .

Background	We attempted to determine whether gynecologic histories differ in women who have and have not experienced an early menopause .
Method	A group of 344 `` case '' women whose average age at menopause was 42.2 years and an age-matched group of 344 `` control '' women still menstruating or menopausal after age 46 were selected from a survey of 10,606 women aged 45 to 54 years for
Result	Case women were more likely to have had menarche at or before age 11 , had shorter cycle lengths , had fewer pregnancies with live births , and had more frequent pelvic operations including unilateral oophorectomy and multiple cesarean sections .
Result	Case women had a greater number of presumed ovulatory cycles , as estimated from age at menarche , average cycle length , and years of anovulation associated with pregnancies or oral contraceptive use .
Result	In a multivariate model including smoking status and body mass index , ovulatory cycles were a significant predictor of early menopause , especially after an estimated 300 ovulations .
Result	The reproductive histories of women who experienced an early menopause suggest a pattern of more rapid oocyte loss ( `` incessant '' ovulation ) .

Background	In a 37-year-old female patient complaining of increasing pain in the neck and occiput , chiropractic manipulations at the cervical vertebral column were associated with ischaemias of the brain stem presenting as vertigo , transient `` locked-in '' sy
Background	Digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) revealed complete obstruction of the right and slight dissection of the left vertebral artery .
Method	The symptoms receded within a few days after heparinisation with 1000 IU/h intravenously .
Method	A 39-year-old female patient developed vertigo , nystagmus , tetraparesis and dysarthria two days after chiropractic intervention because of refractory pain in the neck and occiput .
Background	DSA showed embolism of the basilar artery and extensive dissections of the vertebral arteries .
Method	The basilar artery was completely recanalized after local intraarterial fibrinolysis with 50,000 IU urokinase .
Result	During the further course of treatment the symptoms receded under heparin and phenprocoumon over a period of 8 months , except for hemiparesis on the left side especially affecting the arm .
Result	Trivial traumas can result in dissections of the vertebral arteries .
Result	Severe neck pain is a frequent , typical early symptom .
Result	Hence , patients with cervical vertebral column syndromes should receive chiropractic treatment only after careful diagnosis .

Background	Randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) are widely considered to be the gold standard of evidence for treatment efficacy , but they have not been widely applied to rehabilitation or , more specifically , traumatic brain injury rehabilitation .
Background	Ethical , scientific , and resource factors may limit the application of RCTs .
Background	Thus , rigorous observational alternatives to the RCT would be of great value .
Method	In the article by Powell et al , an attempt to rigorously apply an observational design to assess the relative effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation versus home discharge failed to control for important confounding factors .
Result	It appears nearly impossible to successfully apply observational designs when the factors leading to the applications of different treatments are strongly related to the patient 's perceived prognosis .
Result	However , observational designs may be successfully applied when regional or temporal variations in care are studied .
Result	Moreover , a number of developments in measurement , study design , and statistical analysis may expand the role of observational studies in answering questions of rehabilitation efficacy and effectiveness .

Method	Family stress , family and personal resources , and parental coping were operationalized from self-report questionnaires completed by mothers and fathers in 72 two-parent families who had a child with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .
Result	Three-month and 15-month changes in clinically recorded measures of the CF child 's height and weight data and pulmonary functioning were correlated with the family functioning variables .
Result	Each of the four criterion indices of CF child health changes were regressed separately on the significant family functioning variables .
Result	Twenty-two percent of the variance in 15-month height and weight changes were explained by family stress , family resources , and parental coping .
Result	Family functioning variables also explained 17 % of the variance in 3-month pulmonary functioning changes and 15 % of the variance in 3-month height and weight changes .
Result	These findings suggest that the way in which the family functions has indirect effects on critical indices of a CF child 's health .
Result	These data lend support to an increased focus by physicians and other medical professionals on the health of the total family system as a way to enhance outcomes for children with CF.

Background	The use of induced hypothermia in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) has been studied extensively between the 1960s and 1970s .
Background	Although the treatment showed some promise , it became less popular by the 1980s , mainly because of its adverse effects .
Background	However , a revival of hypothermia in the treatment of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) in the last decade has encouraged neuroscientists to conduct experiments to reevaluate the potential benefits of hypothermia in traumatic SCI .
Background	All laboratory investigations studying the mechanisms of action and/or the efficacy of induced hypothermia in treating experimental traumatic SCI published in the last decade were reviewed .
Background	Although efficacy of hypothermia in improving functional outcome of mild to moderate traumatic SCI has been demonstrated , hypothermia may not be protective against severe traumatic SCI .
Background	At present , induced hypothermia has yet to be recognized or approved as a potential treatment having therapeutic value for traumatic SCI in humans .
Background	The continued search for a possible synergistic effect of induced hypothermia and pharmacological therapy may yield some promise .
Background	It has also been deduced from these laboratory studies that hyperthermia is deleterious and rigorous measures to prevent hyperthermia should be taken to minimize the propagation of secondary neuronal damage after traumatic SCI .

Background	To compare muscle strength and muscle fatigue of the knee extensors and flexors in individuals with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and non-MS control subjects and to evaluate the reliability of muscle strength and muscle fatigue testing in these individuals .
Method	Thirty individuals ( 13 women and 2 men for both MS and control groups ) , age ( mean + / - SD ) 38.8 + / - 10 for MS and 33.1 + / - 7.6 yr for controls , participated in this investigation .
Method	Peak torque was measured on two occasions separated by approximately 7 d at 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) with 2 min of recovery between each bout .
Method	The nondominant leg was tested followed by the dominant leg after 10 min of recovery .
Method	Subjects then performed three bouts of 30 flexions and extensions of the dominant leg at 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) with 1 min of recovery between bouts .
Result	The reliability of muscle torque was very high for individuals with MS ( only 1 of 20 measurements with an ICC below 0.900 ) .
Result	Total work was also highly reliable for MS , but the Fatigue Index ( work during the last 15 contractions/work during the first 15 contractions ) x 100 was not .
Result	Peak torque adjusted for age , body mass , and fat free mass ( measured by whole body plethysmography ; the Bod Pod ; Life Measurement Instruments ; Concord , CA ) was significantly greater for controls than for MS for three of four lower body muscle groups teste
Result	For the muscle fatigue test ( 3 bouts of 30 knee extensions and flexions at 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) ) , the Fatigue Index was greater ( less fatigue ) for the knee extensors for controls than MS for the third bout .
Result	For flexion , the Fatigue Index was greater for controls than MS over the three bouts ( group effect ) .
Result	Total work was significantly greater for controls than MS for the flexors ( group effect ) and approached significance for the extensors .
Result	Individuals with MS were weaker than controls when data were adjusted for age , body mass , and fat free mass .
Result	This latter finding ( force relative to age and fat free mass ) suggests that there is a reduced ability to activate muscle mass in MS and/or the muscle mass of individuals with MS is of lower quality ( i.e. , reduced force/unit muscle mass ) than controls .

Background	Chronic relapsing multifocal osteomyelitis ( CRMO ) results in significant morbidity , especially in those with vertebral collapse .
Background	Symptomatic benefit with intravenous pamidronate ( PAM ) has been shown ; however , few studies have demonstrated radiological benefit .
Method	We describe clinical and radiological data on 7 pediatric cases of CRMO treated with PAM .
Method	Retrospective chart review on all children with CRMO treated with PAM .
Method	Response to PAM was measured by subjective reports and radiology including vertebral morphometry .
Method	Seven patients ( 1 male ) presented with bone pain at a median age of 8 years ( range 5-14 ) .
Method	Symptoms had been present for a median of 18 months ( range 11-51 ) before PAM therapy .
Result	All patients had involvement of multiple nonspinal sites , 5 children had spinal involvement with vertebral fractures , and 5 had joint involvement .
Result	Six cases had symptomatic improvement within 6 months of starting PAM , which was sustained during PAM therapy ( median 26 mo , range 6-41 ) and persisted in the 4 cases who had ceased treatment for the duration of followup ( 27 mo , range 18-51 ) .
Result	The least benefit was seen in the 3 cases with synovial joint involvement .
Result	The 3 cases with spinal radiological followup showed modeling of vertebral fractures and in one patient improvement in kyphosis .
Result	No radiological improvement in nonspinal lesions was seen .
Result	PAM therapy was associated with symptomatic improvement and vertebral modeling in children with CRMO .

Background	Blockade of the adenosine A2A receptor potentiates the effects of levodopa in experimental animals and may offer a novel nondopaminergic target for drug therapy in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
Background	Open-label trials suggest that the nonspecific adenosine antagonist theophylline improves parkinsonian symptoms and increases ON time in advanced patients with PD .
Method	In a double-blind , crossover , placebo-controlled trial , the authors investigated the ability of stable plasma levels of theophylline ( between 10-20 microg/mL after 15 days of treatment ) to modulate the long-duration response and the short-duration respons
Result	Although theophylline induced a longer duration of the effect of levodopa in all Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale variables considered , including dyskinesias , maximal levodopa-induced improvement and the duration of the effect of levodopa did not
Result	Only the secondary variable `` akinesia '' showed a statistical tendency to a more prolonged beneficial response with theophylline during an acute levodopa test ( short-duration response ) , and tremor worsened with theophylline during levodopa withdra
Result	No differences were observed during the subacute course of study medication added to levodopa .
Result	During this exploratory study , the effects of theophylline were not strong enough to potentiate clearly the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa or to increase ON time in patients with advanced PD .

Background	N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) , derived from marine oils , have been shown to protect against various neurological diseases .
Background	However , very little is known about their potential anticonvulsant properties .
Method	The objective of the present study was to determine whether enrichment of brain lipids with n-3 PUFA inhibits seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol .
Result	We demonstrate that increased brain levels of n-3 PUFA in transgenic fat-1 male mice , which are capable of de novo synthesis of n-3 PUFA from n-6 PUFA , increases latency to seizure onset by 45 % , relative to wildtype controls ( p = 0.08 ) .
Result	Compared with wildtype littermates , transgenic fat-1 mice have significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid and total n-3 PUFA in brain total lipid extracts and phospholipids .
Result	Levels of brain docosahexaenoic acid were positively correlated to seizure latency ( p < 0.05 ) .
Result	These findings demonstrate that n-3 PUFA have anticonvulsant properties and suggest the possibility of a novel , non-drug dietary approach for the treatment of epilepsy .

Background	This symposium aims at summarizing some of the scientific bases for current or planned clinical trials in patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .
Background	It stems from the interactions of four researchers involved in basic and clinical research who presented their work at a dedicated Symposium of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego .
Background	After SCI , primary and secondary damage occurs and several endogenous processes are triggered that may foster or hinder axonal reconnection from supralesional structures .
Background	Studies in animals show that some of these processes can be enhanced or decreased by exogenous interventions using drugs to diminish repulsive barriers ( anti-Nogo , anti-Rho ) that prevent regeneration and/or sprouting of axons .
Background	Cell grafts are also envisaged to enhance beneficial immunological mechanisms ( autologous macrophages , vaccines ) or remyelinate axons ( oligodendrocytes derived from stem cells ) .
Background	Some of these treatments could be planned concurrently with neurosurgical approaches that are themselves beneficial to decrease secondary damage ( e.g. , decompression/reconstructive spinal surgery ) .
Background	Finally , rehabilitative approaches based on the presence of functional networks ( i.e. , central pattern generator ) below the lesion combined with the above neurobiological approaches may produce significant functional recovery of some sensorimotor function
Background	More work is needed on all fronts , but already the results offer great hope for functional recovery after SCI based on sound basic and clinical neuroscience research .

Background	Recovery of urinary tract function after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) is important in its own right and may also serve as a model for studying mechanisms of functional recovery after injury in the CNS .
Background	Normal micturition requires coordinated activation of smooth muscle of the bladder ( detrusor ) and striated muscle of the external urethral sphincter ( EUS ) that is controlled by spinal and supraspinal circuitry .
Method	We used a clinically relevant rat model of thoracic spinal cord contusion injury to examine the effect of varying the degree of residual supraspinal connections on chronic detrusor-EUS coordination .
Result	Urodynamic evaluation at 8 weeks after SCI showed that detrusor contractions of the bladder recovered similarly in groups of rats injured with a 10 gm weight dropped 12.5 , 25 , or 50 mm onto the spinal cord .
Result	In contrast , the degree of coordinated activation of the EUS varied with the severity of initial injury and the degree of preservation of white matter at the injury site .
Result	The 12.5 mm SCI resulted in the sparing of 20 % of the white matter at the injury site and complete recovery of detrusor-EUS coordination .
Result	In more severely injured rats , the chronic recovery of detrusor-EUS coordination was very incomplete and correlated to decreased innervation of lower motoneurons by descending control pathways and their increased levels of mRNA for glutamate receptor subu
Result	These results show that the extent of recovery of detrusor-EUS coordination depends on injury severity and the degree of residual connections with brainstem control centers .

Background	Atlantoaxial subluxation has been treated conventionally by Gallie posterior fusion .
Background	This technique , however , has disadvantages such as the frequent occurrence of pseudarthrosis , a high probability of relapse , and the necessity of long-standing strict external fixation until bone fusion .
Method	To overcome these problems , posterior occipitoatlantoaxial fusion was performed using a rectangular rod that assures strong internal fixation in 16 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation .
Method	The condition was complicated by superior migration of the dens in five patients .
Result	Clinical and roentgenographic examinations before and after the operation showed improvements in neurological symptoms and in pain in the neck and occipital region in all patients .
Result	Bone fusion was observed in all patients and reduction , performed to the extent possible during the operation , was retained adequately .
Result	The present method , which provides strong internal fixation , allows bone fusion and early initiation of rehabilitation with a simple external support of the neck .
Result	It also facilitates laminectomy of C1 in patients with associated myelopathy .
Result	This procedure , therefore , is particularly effective in patients with marked instability or with rheumatoid arthritis and makes postoperative application of a halo vest or skull traction unnecessary .

Background	Contemporary computer technology allows precise and fast large database analysis .
Background	Widespread and common use depends on appropriate , user friendly software , usually lacking in special medical applications .
Background	The aim of this work was to develop an integrated system designed to store , explore and analyze data of patients treated for pancreatic cancer .
Background	For that purpose the database administration system MS Visual Fox Pro 3.0 was used and special application , according to ISO 9000 series has been developed .
Background	The system works under MS Windows 95 with possibility of easy adaptation to MS Windows 3.11 or MS Windows NT by graphic user 's interface .
Background	The system stores personal data , laboratory results , visual and histological analyses and information on treatment course and complications .
Background	However the system archives them and enables the preparation reports of according to individual and statistical needs .
Background	Help and security settings allow to work also for one not familiar with computer science .

Background	CYP I A1 polymorphisms , which have been reported to be associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer , are usually detected through conventional methods such as PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism , allele-specific PCR and single-strand conformat
Method	An assay that makes use of differences in thermal stability between perfect match and non-perfect match hybrids has been developed .
Method	Two oligonucleotides probes for each CYP1A1 polymorphic site were designed and labeled with digoxigenin .
Method	After hybridization with amplified DNA fragment , the hybrids were detected with a colorimetric method and the genotype were identified by calculating the ratio of signals obtained with two probes .
Result	The ratios for three genotypes obtained from 50 samples can be divided into three distinctive nonoverlapped groups when applying to m ( 1 ) and m ( 2 ) sites of CYP1A1 locus , which demonstrated the feasibility of this assay to detect CYP I A1 polymorphisms .
Result	Compared with other methods , this assay has lower cost , is fast , simple and is suitable for a screening test in routine laboratory .

Background	Central pain is a particular form of neuropathic pain .
Background	Due to lesions in the spinothalamocortical pathways , ectopic neuronal discharges can occur into different neurons of the spinal cord and brain .
Background	Functional MRI , and positron emission tomography might be able to visualize ongoing pain activity which is , sometimes the consequence of spinothalamocortical lesions .
Background	Sometimes the patient experiences a burning ice-like sensation .
Background	This is more frequent in spinal cord lesions than in brain injuries .
Background	Some adrenergic , gabergic neurotransmitters , glycine , prostanoids and glutamate may play a role in pain transmission .
Background	These transmitters can induce changes in the neuronal membrane potential .
Background	Consequently , amitriptyline as an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor and the sodium channel blockers are the drugs of first-choice .
Method	A test procedure with placebo , opioids , lignocaine , propofol and ketamine might give some insight into advanced drug treatment .
Background	If oral or transdermal drug delivery is not indicated or ineffective , the intrathecal administration route can be attempted with baclofen , clonidine , opioids and midazolam .
Background	Invasive electrostimulation is the last treatment option .
Background	Thalamic stimulation can be tried in spinal cord injuries , and sensory motor cortex stimulation is sometimes the last resort for brain lesions associated with pain .

Background	Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be involved in the genesis , persistence , and severity of neuropathic pain following nerve injury .
Background	The transcription factor , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) , plays a pivotal role in regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression .
Background	To elucidate the role of NF-kappaB in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain , using a gene-based approach of NF-kappaB decoy , we tested whether the activated NF-kappaB affected pain behavior via the expression of inflammatory mediators .
Method	Single endoneurial injections of NF-kappaB decoy , at the site of nerve lesion , significantly alleviated thermal hyperalgesia for up to 2 weeks and suppressed the expression of mRNA of the inflammatory cytokines , iNOS , and adhesion molecules at the site of
Result	This finding suggests that a perineural inflammatory cascade , that involves NF-kappaB , is involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain .

Background	We present the long-term results of a large consecutive series of patients undergoing ileal orthotopic bladder substitution following radical cystectomy .
Method	Between April 1985 and 2005 orthotopic bladder substitution with an ileal low pressure reservoir was performed in 482 patients ( including 40 women ) after radical and , if possible , nerve sparing cystectomy .
Method	In 447 cases the procedure was combined with an afferent ileal isoperistaltic tubular segment .
Method	The patients were followed prospectively .
Result	In the 482 patients 61 early ( less than 30 days ) diversion related complications requiring prolonged hospital stay or readmission were noted and 115 late complications required treatment .
Result	At 1 year continence was good in 92 % of patients during the day and in 79 % at night .
Result	At last followup 93 % of patients could void spontaneously .
Result	Of 442 evaluable men 99 ( 22.4 % ) reported having erections without and 68 ( 15.4 % ) with medical assistance .
Result	Ureteroileal stenosis was observed in 12 of 447 ( 2.7 % ) patients .
Result	Urethral recurrence was detected in 25 of 482 ( 5 % ) patients .
Result	A total of 15 ( 5 % ) patients received vitamin B12 substitution .
Result	Renal parenchyma decreased only in patients with preoperative or postoperative ureteral obstruction .
Result	After 10 years patients with normal renal function had no long-term acidosis and in 20 patients the incidence of osteoporosis resembled that of the normal population .
Result	Ileal orthotopic bladder substitution combined with an afferent ileal tubular segment allows for good long-term functional results provided patients are restrictively selected , postoperative instructions are followed carefully , and typical complications s

Background	We aimed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty ( PVP ) using polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) in patients with symptomatic metastatic spine lesions .
Method	We included 31 patients in this retrospective study who were treated with PMMA from 2003 to 2005 for intractable pain due to metastatic spine lesions .
Method	The types of cancer ( and numbers of patients ) included lung cancer ( 9 ) , breast cancer ( 7 ) , gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract cancers ( 5 ) , hepatobiliary malignancies ( 3 ) , and other types of cancer ( 7 ) .
Method	All patients received vertebroplasty , resulting in 41 treatments ( 16 in thoracic , 25 in lumbar spine ) .
Method	Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores for pain were measured in all patients .
Method	Image studies including contrast-enhanced MRI were performed in all patients .
Result	Results showed characteristic metastatic lesions .
Method	Suspicious lesions were further confirmed as malignant by a bone scan , a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , and pathological exam .
Result	Vertebroplasty resulted in complete or partial pain relief in 29 patients ( 95 % ) , and provided no pain relief in 2 patients ( 5 % ) .
Result	The mean preoperative VAS score of 8.9 ( + / -0.93 ) was higher than the mean postoperative VAS score ( 2.6 + / -1.71 ) .
Method	Metastatic spine lesions were most common in lung and breast cancer patients and these lesions were located more often on segments T12 to L2 ( 53.6 % ) .
Result	Patients with malignancy of hepatobiliary origin did not show improvement in pain scores as dramatically as patients with other types of malignancies , although only a few cases were included in this study .
Result	No patients experienced worsening of symptoms or suffered from vertebroplasty complications .
Result	We conclude that vertebroplasty is a safe , effective , and simple treatment for the management of intractable spinal pain due to metastases .

Background	Despite recent advances using more conservative approaches , standard classical radical neck dissection is still one of the most frequently performed procedures in head and neck cancer patients who have advanced metastatic neck disease .
Background	The trapezius muscle paralysis following division of the spinal accessory nerve results in severe pain and cosmetic disturbance related to malalignment of the shoulder joint .
Method	The objective of this study is to report our results with a newly developed orthosis to prevent and correct shoulder dysfunction following standard radical neck dissection .
Method	Thirty-four patients who underwent standard radical neck dissection as a part of their surgical treatment from 1997-2002 were rehabilitated by the shoulder orthosis .
Method	Beginning 2 weeks after surgery , the patients were allowed to use their orthosis .
Method	By using a standard questionnaire , the pain and activity scores were recorded at the 1st , 3rd , 6th and 12th months postoperatively .
Method	Six patients were excluded from the study , of whom two succumbed to their disease and four discontinued the use of the orthosis .
Result	Of 28 patients included in the study , 20 ( 72 % ) were completely pain free within 3 months following the surgery .
Result	Four patients ( 14 % ) noted their pain level as tolerable , and four patients ( 14 % ) reported no considerable gain in the pain threshold and/or physical activity levels .
Result	Despite the fact that the active abduction range increased only 5 to 20 degrees , the relief of pain and improved malalignment of the scapula and consequently clavicle and humerus led to functional gains , which increased the patients ' endurance .
Result	At the end of the study , 23 patients ( 82 % ) were able to return to their previous jobs or activity levels .
Result	Current preliminary reports suggest that this orthosis can be recommended to prevent significant disability in patients with trapezius palsy due to ablative cancer surgery or other reasons .

Background	Effective management of neuropathic pain is one of the more challenging endeavors for even the most experienced and skilled pain specialist .
Background	Pharmacological therapy is frequently ineffective and/or poorly tolerated , especially in elderly patients .
Background	Many if not most surgical procedures have yielded limited success in the treatment of these pain conditions .
Background	Motor cortex stimulation ( MCS ) has emerged as a promising technique for the management of pain in patients with difficult neuropathic and central pain conditions .
Background	Although MCS has proven most successful for patients with trigeminal neuropathic/deafferentation pain and central poststroke pain , other conditions are now emerging as potential targets for this therapy .
Result	Based on previous as well as ongoing work , it would appear that the future of MCS is indeed bright .
Result	Hopefully , as work continues in this area , investigators will be able to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this modality and be able to further refine the technique of MCS .
Result	It is also possible that with the use of noninvasive tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation , practitioners will be able to predict with accuracy which patients are likely to respond favorably to MCS .

Background	Spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) improves microcirculatory blood flow , relieves ischemic pain and reduces amputation rate in patients with severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease .
Method	To evaluate the transcutaneous oxygen tension ( TcPO2 ) measurements as a specific prognostic parameter in the prediction for permanent device implantation in a prospective controlled study in patients with lower limb ischemia .
Method	45 patients ( 35 men , 10 women ; mean age 65 years , range : 46-70 years ) were submitted to implantation of a spinal cord electrical generator for rest pain , trophic lesions dry gangrene in severe lower limb ischemia , after failed conservative or surgical tre
Method	The clinical status was classified as Fontaine 's stages III and IV and the main pathology was essentially due to atherosclerosis and diabetic vascular disease .
Method	Pedal transcutaneous oxygen tension ( TcPO2 ) , ankle and toe pressure Doppler measurements were performed before , 2 weeks and 4 weeks after implantation .
Result	After 18 months follow-up , pain relief was > 75 % and limb salvage was achieved in 26 patients .
Result	In 9 patients , a partial success with pain relief > 50 % and limb salvage was obtained for at least 6 months .
Result	In 10 patients , the method failed , and the patients ' limbs were amputated .
Method	TcPO2 was assessed on the dorsum of the foot .
Result	Clinical improvement and SCS success was associated with an increase of TcPO2 , within the first 2 weeks after implantation ( temporary period ) .
Result	Limb salvage was achieved in those patients who presented significant TcPO2 increase within the first 2 weeks of the testing period ( from 21.6 mmHg to 29.5 mmHg in the patients with rest pain , P = 0.035 , from 15.2 mmHg to 21.1 mmHg , P = 0.035 in those wit
Result	TcPO2 changes were related to the presence of adequate paresthesias and warmth in the painful area during the trial period .
Result	The systolic ankle/brachial blood pressure index did not change under stimulation .
Result	In patients with failed conservative and surgical treatment for severe critical lower limb ischemia , the SCS increases the skin blood flow , is associated with a significant pain relief and could prove an excellent alternative therapy that improves the qua
Result	We also demonstrate that TcPO2 increase within a test period of 2 weeks , is a predictive index of SCS therapy success and should be considered in terms of cost effect before the final decision for permanent implantation .

Method	Duration of breast feeding was studied in 249 randomly chosen , healthy , term infants of Danish origin of which 80.7 % participated .
Result	Breast feeding was initiated by 99.5 % of the mothers .
Result	At 3 , 6 and 9 months , 71 % , 52 % and 33 % , respectively , were still breast feeding .
Result	Only 1 infant ( 0.5 % ) was exclusively breast fed beyond 7 months of age .
Result	In a Cox multiple regression analysis of factors influencing duration of breast feeding , we found a positive association with maternal education ( p < 0.001 ) and age ( p = 0.02 ) and a negative association with the amount of formula given at the maternity
Result	Six months after delivery , 79 % of the mothers with higher school education ( > or = 12 years ) were still breast feeding , compared to 29 % with a low school education ( < or = 9 years ) .
Result	There is still a need for an increased effort to support mothers in breast feeding , focusing particularly on younger mothers with short school education .
Result	Formula supplements during the first days of life , given to 73 % of the infants , were associated with a shorter duration of breast feeding and should be discouraged .

Background	Areas of current research in the nature and remediation of the long-term sequelae of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) are reviewed .
Background	Studies identifying features that predict outcome still greatly outnumber those of efficacy of rehabilitation .
Background	A growing interest is in acute biochemical change that may exacerbate poor outcome .

Background	The possibility of the formation under chronic experimental conditions of a reaction of a selective character to species-specific acoustic signals ( SAS ) of the agonistic type , presented to cats against the background of subthreshold electrical stimulation
Result	Reactions appropriate to the SAS presented appeared only in those animals in which threshold electrical stimulation evoked directed aggressive reactions .
Result	Partial bilateral ablation of the sensorimotor region of the cortex ( SMC ) did not influence the selective character of the reaction to the SAS , but led to a change by comparison with the preoperative period in the relationship of the motoric and acoustic

Background	Galanin expression markedly increases in the dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) after sciatic nerve axotomy and modulates pain behavior and regeneration of sensory neurons .
Method	Here , we describe transgenic mice expressing constructs with varying amounts of sequence upstream of the murine galanin gene marked by LacZ .
Result	The 20 kb region upstream of the galanin gene recapitulates the endogenous expression pattern of galanin in the embryonic and adult intact DRG and after axotomy .
Result	In contrast , 1.9 kb failed to drive LacZ expression in the intact DRG or after axotomy .
Result	However , the addition of an additional 2.7 kb of 5 ' flanking DNA ( 4.6 kb construct ) restored the expression in the embryonic DRG and in the adult after axotomy .
Result	Sequence analysis of this 2.7 kb region revealed unique 18 and 23 bp regions containing overlapping putative Ets - , Stat - , and Smad-binding sites , and adjacent putative Stat - and Smad-binding sites , respectively .
Result	Deletion of the 18 and 23 bp regions from the 4.6 kb construct abolished the upregulation of LacZ expression in the DRG after axotomy but did not affect expression in the embryonic or intact adult DRG .
Result	Also , a bioinformatic analysis of the upstream regions of a number of other axotomy-responsive genes demonstrated that the close proximity of putative Ets - , Stat - , and Smad-binding sites appears to be a common motif in injury-induced upregulation in gene

Background	Gas exchange during exercise in patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is characterised by an elevated physiological deadspace to tidal volume ratio .
Background	While this has been attributed to alveolar ventilation perfusion mismatch , there are other potential causes of the high proportion of wasted ventilation , including factors relating to the volume and the ventilation of the airway deadspace .
Method	CF ( n = 6 , F = 1 , FEV1 26-63 % pred ) and control ( n = 6 , F = 2 ) subjects completed steady-state exercise on a cycle ergometer .
Method	Gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath and the volume of the airway deadspace ( V ( Daw ) ) determined using the equal areas method .
Method	Exercise data were interpolated to a CO2 output of 0.7 l/min .
Result	V ( Daw ) was similar in the two groups both at rest and during exercise .
Result	However , the airway deadspace ventilation ( V ( Daw ) ) ( median ( inter-quartile range ) ) , patients , 6.8 ( 5.1-7 .1 ) l/min ; controls , 4.9 ( 3.5-5 .6 ) l/min , P < 0.05 ) was significantly greater in the CF group due to a greater respiratory frequency .
Result	These results indicate that in CF patients , abnormally increased V ( Daw ) is an important contributor to the total ( physiological ) deadspace ventilation .
Result	Exercise performance in CF might be enhanced by efforts directed at facilitating an increase in exercise tidal volume and therefore the adoption of a more efficient pattern of breathing .

Background	Treatment of human alpha-linolenic acid deficiency ( ALAD ) with ethyl linolenate is reported .
Method	The patient 's scaly dermatitis nearly disappeared after 5-d supplementation with 0.1 mL ethyl linolenate .
Result	Pretreatment content of various n-3 fatty acids in RBC was 0-15 % of healthy controls .
Result	After 14 d of supplementation , cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced by 70 % of pretreatment values , 22:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3 increased three - to fourfold while 18:3 n-3 and 20:5 n-3 remained low , indicating a rapid elongation and desaturation of 18:3 n-3 in
Result	Urinary excretion of PGI2-M was approximately 10 times higher than in healthy control subjects , while PGI3-M excretion was low .
Result	Linolenate supplementation increased PGI2-M excretion twofold , while PGI3-M remained near detection limit .
Result	Platelet capacity to synthesize TXA2 , and urinary excretion of TXB2 +3 - M were nearly unaffected by supplementation .
Result	The results confirm that the minimal daily requirement of alpha-linolenic acid is 0.2-0 .3 % of total energy .

Background	Lung transplantation is extremely stressful for patients and accompanying support persons .
Method	To improve delivery of care , we designed a cross-sectional study about unmet needs and perceived helpfulness of staff .
Method	The sample consisted of 30 adult lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis ( and 22 relatives ) and 20 age-matched recipients with other reasons for transplantation ( and 17 relatives ) .
Method	Mean survival since transplantation was 5 years .
Method	Data were collected via questionnaires ( numerical rating scales and fill-in-the-blank items ) .
Result	Most patients in both groups were satisfied with staff support ( nurse , doctor ) especially during the acute stage of illness .
Result	Relatives were less satisfied at all stages .
Result	Patients ' satisfaction with doctors ' support was higher after than before transplantation , but the opposite was true for relatives .
Result	Insufficient continuity of care was the most frequent critical comment from patients and support persons .
Result	Recommendations to improve delivery of care included providing access to psychosocial professionals and broadening the information provided before transplantation .
Result	Regular screening of customer satisfaction should become routine .
Result	Particular attention should be paid to support persons .

Background	Cervical cancer retains its character as a venereal disease associated with infections and multiple sexual partners , but poverty also is important .
Background	Precise incidence figures for cervical and endometrial cancer are almost nonexistent because in areas with precise case counts there is rarely accurate knowledge of hysterectomy prevalence .
Background	For endometrial cancer little recent attention has been paid to any risk factor except exogenous estrogen .
Background	It is now suggested that a low pregnancy rate is a cause , not a consequence , of ovarian pathology leading to cancer .
Background	Some progress has been made in separating the epidemiologies of various kinds of ovarian and uterine cancer .
Background	A few clues are available regarding the epidemiology of fallopian tube cancers and vaginal cancers other than those produced by maternal stilbestrol .
Background	Vulvar cancer becomes common only after the age of 75 and so has been neglected epidemiologically .

Background	Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) is a rare pathology ( about 1 case per million ) but it has a great importance for Public Health ; the Italian National CJD register has been established in the Istituto Superiore di Sanita ( ISS ) since 1993 , and epidemiologica
Background	This paper reports a mortality study carried out comparing and integrating data from the two available sources : the National CJD Register and the Italian Data Base on Mortality , processed by the ISS Statistics Unit , on the data collected by the Italian Ce
Result	The study allowed to estimate : the underreporting of CJD mortality to both sources , the misclassification of ISTAT data and the integrated mortality rates from CJD in Italy : 1.58 per million persons aged 25 or more , average rate during the period 1993-199

Background	Adherence to oral hygiene is an important aspect of the treatment of periodontal disease .
Background	Traditional educational interventions have been shown to be of little value in achieving long term behaviour change .
Method	The aim of this review was to determine the impact of interventions aimed to increase adherence to oral hygiene instructions in adult periodontal patients based on psychological models and theoretical frameworks .
Method	This review considered the following outcomes Observational measures of oral health related behaviour Self reported oral health related behaviours , beliefs and attitudes towards oral health related behaviour Clinical markers of periodontal disease .
Method	The Cochrane Oral Health Group 's Trials Register ( 2005 ) , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( The Cochrane Library 2004 , Issue 4 ) , MEDLINE ( from 1966 to December 2004 ) , EMBASE ( from 1980 to December 2004 ) , PSYCHINFO ( from 1966 to December 2004 ) , Ingenta ( from 1998 to December 2004 ) and CINAHL ( from 1966 to December 2004 ) .
Method	Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information .
Method	No language restriction was applied .
Method	Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of interventions based on psychological models compared with educational , attention or no active intervention controls to improve adherence to oral hygiene in adults with either gingivitis or periodon
Method	Titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review were independently screened by two review authors .
Method	Those that were clearly ineligible were rejected .
Method	For the remaining studies , the full paper was reviewed by two review authors and where necessary further information was sought from the author to verify eligibility .
Method	Included studies were assessed on their quality using standard criteria .
Result	The review identified four studies ( including 344 participants ) in which a psychological model or theory had been explicitly used as the basis for the design of the intervention .
Result	The overall quality of trials was low .
Result	Due to the hetereogeneity between studies , both in terms of outcome measures and psychological models adopted , a meta-analysis was not possible .
Result	The four studies adopted four different theoretical frameworks , though there was some overlap in that three of the studies incorporated elements of Operant and Classical Conditioning .
Result	Psychological interventions resulted in improved plaque scores in comparison to no intervention groups , and in one study in comparison to an attention control group .
Result	One study found decreased gingival bleeding in the active intervention group but no change in pocket depth or attachment loss after 4 months .
Result	Psychological interventions were associated with improved self reported brushing and flossing in both studies which assessed these behaviours .
Result	Only one study explored the impact of psychological interventions on beliefs and attitudes , the psychological intervention , in comparison to educational and no intervention controls , showed improved self efficacy beliefs in relation to flossing , but no ef
Result	There is tentative evidence from low quality studies that psychological approaches to behaviour management can improve oral hygiene related behaviours .
Result	However , the overall quality of the included trials was low .
Result	Furthermore , the design of the interventions was weak and limited , ignoring key aspects of the theories .
Result	Thus , there is a need for greater methodological rigour in the design of trials in this area .

Background	Numerous studies have demonstrated that lesions in the CNS can alter the density of sensory nerve processes in peripheral organs .
Method	In the present study , rat spinal cords were transected at the second lumbar segmental level and the density of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) - immunoreactive nerve fibers in the urinary bladder was examined .
Method	Additional rats had spinal cord transections followed by 12 days of treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist , MK-801 .
Result	In the bladders of control rats , CGRP-immunoreactive fibers were present as thick nerve trunks , perivascular plexi , and a fine meshwork of varicose nerve fibers .
Result	Twelve days following a spinal cord transection , the density of CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers was markedly reduced ; occasional fibers appeared primarily as nonvaricose fine fibers .
Result	In bladders from rats receiving a spinal cord transection and MK-801 treatment , CGRP-immunoreactive fibers were abundantly distributed throughout the detrusor muscle ; these fibers exhibited numerous varicosities as well as some enlarged terminal varicosit
Result	These data demonstrate that ( i ) an upper motor neuron-type lesion markedly decreases the density of CGRP-immunoreactive peripheral afferent nerve processes and ( ii ) following a spinal cord transection , MK-801 appears to enhance the density of CGRP immunos

Background	Critically injured patients are susceptible to the abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) , which requires decompressive laparotomy with delayed abdominal closure .
Background	Previous work by the University of Texas Houston group showed impaired gut function after resuscitation-associated gut edema .
Method	The purpose of this study was to determine if enteral nutrition was precluded by the intra-abdominal hypertension and bowel edema of the ACS .
Method	Patients developing postinjury ACS from January 1996 to August 2003 at our level-I trauma center were reviewed .
Method	Patient demographics , time to definitive abdominal closure , and institution and tolerance of enteral nutrition were evaluated .
Result	Thirty-seven patients developed postinjury ACS during the study period ; 26 men and 11 women with a mean age of 36 + / - 4 and injury severity score of 33 + / - 4 .
Result	Mean intra-abdominal pressure before decompression was 32 + / - 3 mm Hg , and concurrent mean peak airway pressure was 50 + / - 4 cm oxygen .
Result	Enteral feeding was never started in 12 patients ; 4 died within 48 hours of admission , 7 required vasoactive agents until their death , and 1 developed an enterocutaneous fistula requiring parenteral nutrition .
Result	Enteral feeding was initiated in the remaining 25 patients : 13 had feeds started within 24 hours of abdominal closure ; 5 were fed with open abdomens ; and 7 had a delay because of vasopressors ( n = 2 ) , multiple trips to the operating room ( n = 2 ) , paralyti
Result	Once advanced , enteral feeding was tolerated in 23 ( 92 % ) of the 25 patients with attainment of goal feeds in a mean of 3.1 + / - 1 days .
Result	Despite the bowel edema and intra-abdominal hypertension related to the ACS , early enteral feeding is feasible after definitive abdominal closure .

Background	The cognitive profile and outcome of Encephalitis Lethargica has not been systematically described in the literature .
Background	Treatment has typically focused upon medical management .
Method	The first case report of a patient with Encephalitis Lethargica who underwent a systematic programme of cognitive rehabilitation is presented .
Method	Initial neuropsychological assessment conducted during her acute presentation indicated generalized cognitive dysfunction , including memory and executive function impairments .
Method	An outpatient cognitive rehabilitation programme addressed the development of awareness and the remediation of memory and executive function impairments .
Result	Repeat assessment indicated significant improvement in cognitive function .
Method	The components of her rehabilitation programme are discussed .
Result	She has been able to successfully return to her pre-morbid level of work responsibility within 8 months of her admission .

Background	Intensive management of severe closed head injury is pursued in most neurosurgical units , as it no doubt reduces mortality .
Background	However , the fate of those salvaged from death is less clearly defined .
Background	The impact of aggressive management on the psychological recovery is even less clear .
Method	This retrospective study of children admitted to a regional paediatric neurosurgical service attempts to address these issues .
Method	Eighty-four children between the ages of 3 to 16 years with severe head injuries were studied and categorized according to conservative or intensive treatment groups .
Method	The availability of intensive management led to a greater number of such children referred .
Result	The mortality in those children sustaining more severe injury , i.e. Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) 3 or 4 , was halved ( 44 % ) with intensive management from 80 % in the conservative group .
Result	For those with less severe injury ( GCS 5-8 ) , it was unchanged at about 23 % .
Result	The reduced mortality is at the expense of increased morbidity .
Result	Psychological testing showed that the cognitive recovery was comparable .

Background	To document differences in color Doppler flow and gray-scale ultrasonographic ( US ) features between benign and malignant axillary lymph nodes in women with primary breast cancer .
Method	The longitudinal-transverse axis ratio and hilar status on color Doppler flow and gray-scale US images were prospectively studied for each of 145 axillary nodes in 135 women ( 74 palpable nodes in 69 women , 71 nonpalpable nodes in 66 women ) with primary br
Method	Intranodal flow distribution was described as peripheral , central , or central perhilar .
Method	Resistive and pulsatility indexes and peak systolic velocity were documented .
Method	For comparison of benign and malignant features , nodes were divided into three groups palpable and nonpalpable , palpable , and nonpalpable .
Result	Color flow was demonstrated equally well in benign and malignant axillary lymph nodes for all three groups .
Result	For all nodes , peripheral flow was significantly higher in malignant ( 118 of 153 nodes [ 77 % ] ) than benign ( 45 of 160 nodes [ 28 % ] ) nodes ( P < .001 ) ; central flow and central perhilar flow were significantly greater ( P < .002 and < .001 , respectively )
Result	Similar differences were not observed in nonpalpable nodes .
Result	The mean longitudinal-transverse axis ratio ( + / - SD ) was significantly lower in malignant ( 1.8 + / - 0.6 ) than benign ( 2.6 + / - 0.8 ) nodes .
Result	Logistic regression analysis showed peripheral , central , and central perhilar flow and the mean longitudinal-transverse axis ratio to be significant independent predictors of malignancy .
Result	Color Doppler flow and gray-scale US features applicable to the identification of disease in palpable axillary nodes in patients with breast cancer are not applicable to nonpalpable nodes .

Background	The calculation of protein structures from nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) data has been greatly facilitated by improvements in software for the automatic assignment of NOESY spectra .
Background	Nevertheless , for larger proteins , resonance overlap may lead to an overwhelming number of assignment options per peak .
Background	Although most software for automatic NOESY assignment can deal with a certain level of assignment ambiguity , structure calculations fail when this becomes too high .
Background	Reducing the number of assignment options per peak by reducing the chemical shift tolerances can lead to correct assignments being excluded , and thus also to incorrect structures .
Method	We have investigated , systematically , for three proteins of different size , the influence of the chemical shift tolerance limits ( Delta ) and of the number of simulated annealing ( SA ) cooling steps on the performance of the software ARIA .
Result	Large tolerance windows , and the correspondingly high levels of ambiguity , did not cause problems when appropriately slower cooling was used in our SA protocol .
Result	In cases where a high percentage of well-converged structures was not achieved , we demonstrate that it is more productive to calculate fewer structures whilst applying slow cooling , than to calculate many structures with fast cooling .
Result	In this way , high-quality structures were obtained even for proteins whose NMR spectra showed great degeneracy , and where there was much inconsistency in peak alignment between different samples .
Result	The method described herein opens the way to the automated structure determination of larger proteins from NMR data .

Background	Although antiretrovirals can prolong life , medication adherence also poses a constant challenge for HIV-infected individuals because the success of antiretroviral regimens demands nearly perfect adherence to medications .
Background	This paper describes the psychiatric and social barriers to adherence in a convenience sample of HIV-positive clients in methadone treatment in the Bronx , New York .
Background	The study sample was part of a national study of HIV treatment adherence and health care utilization among triply diagnosed populations , the HIV/AIDS Treatment Adherence Health Outcomes and Cost Study .
Method	The triply diagnosed study sample is defined here as HIV-infected individuals who screened into the study with at least one psychiatric diagnosis in addition to opioid dependence on agonist therapy ( methadone treatment ) and at least one substance use diag
Method	Interviewers utilized modified versions of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders ( SCID-I ) , the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders ( SCID-II ) , and the Addiction Severity Index ( ASI-Lite ) , among a battery of Cost Study instruments .
Result	Results showed that within this sample , borderline personality disorder was significantly associated with nonadherence to HIV medications .
Result	A related finding showed a significant relationship between serious social/family problems and nonadherence .
Result	These findings build on previous research on the impact of psychiatric illness on HIV medication adherence and suggest that psychiatric assessment and treatment options be linked to adherence interventions .

Background	Frequently , when the acute phase of a frail older person 's illness resolves , the patient is too weak to function independently and can not be discharged from hospital .
Background	Acute care staff often lack the ability and resources to deal adequately with these situations .
Background	A program of transitional ( or subacute ) care at Ontario 's Mississauga Hospital has been shown to fill this gap in the continuum of care by improving the functional level of frail elders and ensuring better bed utilization .

Background	Physical activity is recommended for secondary prevention of several diseases but it is not always clear how reliable the evidence is .
Method	We searched MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library for systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials published 1998-2004 .
Result	We identified 30 eligible systematic reviews and excluded 13 that contained trials covered in larger reviews or were older than other reviews on the same subject .
Result	Physical activity decreased all-cause mortality in patients with coronary heart disease , odds ratio 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.54 to 0.98 ) , increased maximum walking time in patients with intermittent claudication by 6.5 min ( 4.4 to 8.7 ) , and decreas
Result	There were positive effects also in heart failure , chronic obstructive lung disease , type 2 diabetes and fibromyalgia , but they need confirmation in high-quality trials .
Result	Exercise improved quality of life in several conditions and generally led to improved physical performance .
Result	An effect was not shown in stroke , asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , acute or chronic low back pain , chronic fatigue syndrome , depression , cystic fibrosis or HIV/AIDS .
Result	The occurrence of harms was generally not reported .
Result	Physical activity can have important , and even life-saving , effects as secondary prevention of disease , but more and better trials are needed to fully assess its benefits and harms , in particular trials that compare exercise with drugs .

Background	The prevalence of obesity and overweight is increasing world-wide .
Background	Obesity in children impacts on their health in both the short and longer term .
Background	Obesity prevention strategies are poorly understood .
Method	To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent obesity in childhood .
Method	Electronic databases were searched from 1985 to October 1999 .
Method	Data from RCTs and non-randomised trials with concurrent control group were included .
Method	studies with follow up of one year minimum were selected , A priori , this was subsequently amended to include studies with minimum follow up of three months .
Method	The possible susceptibility of post hoc questions to bias is addressed .
Method	Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality .
Method	Seven studies were included , three long-term and four short - term .
Result	The studies included were diverse in terms of study design and quality , target population , theoretical underpinning of intervention approach , and outcome measures .
Result	As such , it was not possible to combine study findings using statistical methods .
Result	The findings of the review suggest that currently there is limited quality data on the effectiveness of obesity prevention programs and as such no generalisable conclusions can be drawn .
Result	The need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions remains a priority .

Background	Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) denotes the presence of metastatic disease and is largely incurable using present-day therapies .
Background	Chemotherapy remains a therapeutic option in this patient population , and there are many pertinent issues surrounding its use in patients with stage IV NSCLC .
Method	Eleven questions were framed by the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines Committee , and these were addressed by a systematic search of the available literature .
Method	The issues addressed included the identification of prognostic factors in selecting patients for chemotherapy and a critical analysis of the survival benefit provided by chemotherapy .
Background	Given the development of several new chemotherapy agents over the past decade , the impact that these agents have made was addressed as well as the definition of a standard of care regarding chemotherapeutic regimens .
Background	Given the fact that chemotherapy does not represent a curative option , other issues addressed were the optimal duration of treatment as well as its impact on symptom relief and quality of life , the role of second-line therapy , and the outcomes expectation
Method	The question of what specialty delivered the chemotherapy also was addressed .
Method	Once the data were identified , a critical analysis was undertaken attempting to objectively portray the data in support of answers for each of the questions posed .
Result	We believe the data support the fact that properly selected patients benefit from chemotherapy with regard to survival and palliation in both first-line and second-line settings .
Result	It appears that in trials addressing the duration of first-line therapy , this survival and palliative benefit occurs early , and prolonged therapy is not indicated .
Result	Therapy in this setting is cost-effective , and there are several regimens that can be considered to be `` standard-of-care '' options .
Result	Physicians involved in the diagnosis of these patients should be aware of the potential benefits of chemotherapy , allowing them to give recommendations to patients that are based on data derived from clinical trials .
Result	In addition , this awareness will allow them to make referrals , when appropriate , to physicians who are trained in the administration of chemotherapy and the management of patients undergoing such therapy .

Background	To determine the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations and the functional and pain outcomes after a single intravenous infusion of erythropoietin at the start of a standard radiotherapy and steroid protocol .
Method	Ten paraparetic patients with malignant extradural spinal cord compression who were eligible for radiotherapy , lumbar puncture and intravenous epoetin alpha were enrolled .
Method	The patients received epoetin alpha 1500 IU/kg intravenously over 30 min followed by a standardised dexamethasone and radiotherapy protocol .
Method	A lumbar puncture and venipuncture were carried out 24-30 h after the epoetin alpha infusion .
Method	The patients were followed closely at defined intervals .
Result	Erythropoietin was detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid in all eight patients sampled ( median 92.5 mIU/ml , range 17.8-214 .0 mIU/ml ) .
Result	Before treatment , eight patients were non-ambulatory and two patients were ambulatory with assistance .
Result	After treatment , eight ( 80 % , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 44-97 % ) improved at least one functional class and recovered or maintained ambulation .
Result	Five of seven patients ( 71 % ; 95 % CI 29-96 % ) with objective sensory deficits and one of seven ( 14 % ; 95 % CI 0-58 % ) catheter-dependent patients recovered .
Result	Overall , 78 % ( 95 % CI 40-97 % ) had a pain response .
Result	After an intravenous infusion of epoetin alpha , radiotherapy and steroids , high concentrations of erythropoietin were detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid .
Result	Patients with malignant extradural spinal cord compression showed encouraging improvements in neurological function and pain .

Background	We investigated the relationship of neurologic , neuropsychological , and social interaction impairments to the work status of a large sample of penetrating head-injured patients wounded some 15 years earlier during combat in Vietnam .
Method	Extensive standardized testing of neurologic , neuropsychological , and social functioning was done at follow-up on each head-injured patient ( N = 520 ) , as well as on a sample of uninjured controls ( N = 85 ) .
Result	Fifty-six percent of the head-injured patients were working at follow-up compared with 82 % of the uninjured controls .
Result	Seven systematically defined impairments proved to be most correlated with work status .
Result	These were post-traumatic epilepsy , paresis , visual field loss , verbal memory loss , visual memory loss , psychological problems , and violent behavior .
Result	These disabilities had a cumulative and nearly equipotent effect upon the likelihood of work .
Result	We suggest that a simple summed score of the number of these seven disabilities can yield a residual `` disability score '' which may prove to be a practical tool for assessing the likelihood of return to work for patients in this population and per
Result	These findings may also help to focus rehabilitation efforts on those disabilities most likely to affect return to work .

Method	Data from serial follow-up evaluations of 103 patients with traumatic and atraumatic myelopathy were recorded to determine rates of significant bacteriuria associated with various types of bladder emptying in an outpatient population .
Method	Urine culture specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization .
Method	Rates of urinary tract infection in bladder-retrained patients , patients using intermittent self-catheterization , and patients with indwelling catheters were compared at sequential follow-up visits .
Result	Infection rates were similar ( 20 % to 30 % ) in persons with catheter-free voiding after successful bladder retraining and in those using sterile intermittent self-catheterization .
Result	In the latter group , however , there was a trend toward higher infection rates beyond 15 months after rehabilitation .
Result	As expected , persons with indwelling catheters had universally high infection rates .
Result	Generally lower infection rates were found in persons with incomplete myelopathies ( 18 % ) than in those with complete myelopathies ( 34 % ) .
Result	Tetraplegic persons had 2.5 times the infection rate of paraplegic persons in the bladder-retrained group .
Result	Infection rates tended to be lower in persons with lower motor neuron bladder dysfunction than in those with upper motor neuron or mixed bladder dysfunction .

Method	To examine the effects of altering the fatty acid ( FA ) composition of intravenous ( IV ) lipid emulsions on pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) and thromboxane production , we studied three groups of newborn piglets after three days of either sow 's milk ( mil
Result	At baseline , and during hypoxia at 20 min and 2 h , cardiac output ( Q ) was measured , PVR calculated and plasma levels of a prostacyclin metabolite ( 6-keto-PgF1alpha ) and thromboxane B2 ( TxB2 ) were measured .
Method	Fatty acid composition of the lung phospholipids was analyzed .
Result	There was an exaggerated increase in PVR and decrease in Q during prolonged hypoxia in the TPN-SBO group as compared with the other two groups .
Result	There was no difference in PVR and Q between the milk and TPN-FO groups .
Result	FA of lung phospholipids reflected the high dietary level of long chain n-3 FA in the TPN-FO group .
Result	However , no differences in plasma levels of 6-keto-PgF1alpha or TxB2 were found .
Result	Intravenous emulsions made from SBO reduced cardiac output and increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the hypoxic newborn piglet , whereas iv FO emulsions did not .
Result	When subjects with pulmonary hypertension are receiving TPN iv SBO may be detrimental ; iv FO may be beneficial , giving similar responses as in a milk-fed subject .

Background	Experimental models and clinical observations of acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) support the concepts of primary and secondary injury , in which the initial mechanical insult is succeeded by a series of deleterious events that promote progressive tissue dam
Background	Whereas the primary injury is fated by the circumstances of the trauma , the outcome of the secondary injury may be amenable to therapeutic modulation .
Method	This article reviews the pathogenetic determinants of these two phases of injury and summarizes the pharmacological manipulations that may restore neurological function after SCI .
Method	Experimental models of SCI and their inherent limitations in simulating human SCI are surveyed .
Method	The pathogenesis of primary and secondary injury , as well as the theoretical bases of neurological recovery , are examined in detail .
Method	The effects of glucocorticoids , lazeroids , gangliosides , opiate antagonists , calcium channel blockers , glutamate receptor antagonists , antioxidants , free radical scavengers , and other pharmacological agents in both animal models and human trials are summa
Method	Practical limitations to inducing neural regeneration are also addressed .
Result	The molecular events that mediate the pathogenesis of SCI are logical targets for pharmacological manipulation and include glutamate accumulation , aberrant calcium fluxes , free radical formation , lipid peroxidation , and generation of arachidonic acid meta
Result	Enhancement of neural regeneration and plasticity comprise other possible strategies .
Result	Pharmacological agents must be given within a narrow window of opportunity to be effective .
Result	Although many therapeutic agents show potential promise in animal models , only methylprednisolone has been shown in large , randomized , double-blinded human studies to enhance the functional recovery of neural elements after acute SCI .
Result	Future therapy is likely to involve various combinations of these agents .

Background	To determine the predictive value of the rate of change of serial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) values in patients with symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy but who have indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound findings , and to determine whethe
Method	A retrospective study was performed on consecutive emergency department patients from August 1 , 1991 , through August 1 , 1998 , presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding , a positive beta-hCG test result , and indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound fi
Method	Patients were eligible for the study if they had a second beta-hCG assay performed within 7 days of the initial visit and before either a diagnostic dilation and evacuation or laparoscopy .
Method	Patients were excluded if they were lost to follow-up .
Method	Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the rate of change of beta-hCG values over a 48-hour interval ( increase by > 66 % , increase by < 66 % , decrease by < 50 % , decrease by > 50 % ) .
Method	In addition , the 4 main groups were further subdivided depending on whether the endometrial cavity was empty at ultrasound examination .
Method	Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the rate of change of the beta-hCG value were compared using logistic regression .
Method	Logistic regression also was used to determine whether addition of the ultrasound result improved predicative accuracy .
Method	A P value of less than .05 was considered significant .
Method	Odds ratios ( ORs ) were determined for each subgroup .
Result	Three hundred thirty-one eligible patients were identified ; of these , 24 were excluded .
Result	Of the 307 enrolled patients , 33 ( 10.7 % ) had a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy .
Result	Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the beta-hCG rate of change were significant ( P < .0001 ) .
Result	Addition of the ultrasound result to this model further improved predicative accuracy ( P < .0001 ) .
Result	Overall , patients with increasing beta-hCG values were at increased risk compared with those with decreasing beta-hCG values , and patients with empty uteri at ultrasound were at increased risk compared with those with uteri that were not empty .
Result	Combining the beta-hCG rate of change with the ultrasound result identified 3 high-risk groups : patients with beta-hCG values that increased by less than 66 % and an empty uterus at ultrasound ( OR 24.8 ) ; patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by less
Result	Patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by more than 50 % were found to be at low risk for ectopic pregnancy irrespective of the specific endometrial findings at ultrasound .
Result	The rate of change of serial beta-hCG values , in patients with an indeterminate pelvic ultrasound examination , is predictive of ectopic pregnancy .
Result	Addition of whether the endometrial cavity is empty at ultrasound leads to a further improvement in predictive accuracy .

Background	The role of novel nutrients that appear to have pharmacological effects on the immune system has been studied over the past 20 years .
Background	This area of research has been termed immunonutrition .
Background	This paper provides an overview of particular novel nutrients -- argtnine , glutamine , omega-3 fatty acids , and nucleotides -- and examines some of the evidence for the effects that they may have on immune function .
Background	The benefits to particular patient groups are also considered ( Box 1 ) .

Background	To compare the presence in levels of antiovarian antibodies ( AOAb ) in the pre - and postovulatory stage from serum of infertile patients undergoing intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) or in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) with outcome of the procedures .
Method	Serum from 36 women undergoing IUI , 36 women undergoing IVF and 25 fertile , healthy controls were assayed for the presence of AOAb by a commercially available ELISA kit .
Result	AOAb was positive in 59.7 % of infertile women , while none of the fertile controls were positive for AOAb .
Result	The levels of these antibodies increased as the patient age and the number of treatment attempts increased .
Result	Though the presence of AOAb did not affect oocyte recovery rate , it resulted in decreased fertilization rate , cleavage rate , and pregnancy rate in infertile women .
Result	Our studies suggest that AOAb may be a cause of infertility and presence of these antibodies could have adverse effects on the outcome of assisted reproductive techniques .

Background	To systematically review studies that examined the effectiveness of wrist guards in preventing wrist injuries among snowboarders .
Method	PubMED was searched for the year 2005 to capture any recently published studies not yet indexed in MEDLINE .
Method	The reference lists of included studies and conference proceedings were also searched .
Method	Studies were included if the number of wrist injuries between wrist guarded and unguarded snowboarders could be ascertained .
Method	Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , cohort studies , and case-control studies were included .
Method	Six studies were included .
Method	Information regarding study design , patient characteristics , wrist guard characteristics , data source ( for cohort and case-control studies ) , and results ( type and severity of injury , compliance , and adverse events ) were extracted .
Method	Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer .
Result	Data from RCTs and cohort studies were expressed as relative risks with odds ratios presented for case-control studies .
Result	The risk of wrist injury ( RR : 0.23 ; 95 % CI : 0.13 , 0.41 ) , wrist fracture ( RR : 0.29 ; 95 % CI : 0.10 , 0.87 ) , and wrist sprain ( RR : 0.17 ; 95 % CI : 0.07 , 0.41 ) was significantly reduced with the use of wrist guards .
Result	Among the case-control studies , wrist guards significantly lowered the odds of sustaining a wrist injury ( OR : 0.46 ; 95 % CI : 0.35 , 0.62 ) .
Result	In an RCT , the risk ratio suggested wrist guards protect the shoulder ( RR : 0.22 ; 95 % CI : 0.01 , 4.60 ) .
Result	Nonexperimental data suggested the possibility that wrist guards may increase the risk of finger and elbow-shoulder injuries .
Result	Wrist guards reduce the risk of wrist injuries among snowboarders .
Result	For every 50 snowboarders who were a wrist guard , one wrist injury will be averted .
Result	Future research should focus on determining the optimal type of wrist guard and if they increase the risk of other upper extremity injuries .

Background	In cervical spondylotic myelopathy , extended anterior spinal cord decompression necessitates subsequent stable vertebral reconstruction .
Background	Reconstruction with an iliac crest graft and screw-plate fixation gives satisfactory clinical and radiological results , but they are often compromised by morbidity involving the bone harvest .
Method	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution to cervical reconstruction of a biocompatible , radiolucent cage combined with screw-plate fixation , making use of bone harvested in situ .
Method	This prospective study was performed between July 2000 and March 2001 in eight women and nine men ( mean age , 55 years ) operated for cervical spondylotic myelopathy .
Method	Situated between levels C3 and C6 , the cage was inserted after one corporectomy in ten patients , two corporectomies in five patients , and three corporectomies in two patients .
Method	The cage consisted of a polyester mesh impregnated with poly-L-lactic acid ( PLLA ) conferring temporary rigidity to the cage during bony fusion .
Method	Clinical and radiological follow-up ( plain films , computed tomographic reconstruction in three cases ) was performed at 2 months , 6 months , 12 months , 24 months and 36 months , postoperatively , with a mean follow-up of 30 months .
Method	Functional results were evaluated according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association 's scoring system .
Method	An independent surgeon assessed the radiological evidence of anterior cervical fusion using the grades proposed by Bridwell [ 6 ] .
Result	Every patient experienced neurological recovery .
Result	At last follow-up , radiological findings were consistent with grade I ( complete fusion ) in five cases , grade II ( probable fusion ) in ten cases , grade III ( radiolucent halo in favor of non fusion ) in one case , and grade IV ( graft lysis ) in one case with pe
Method	In three cases there was screw breakage ( two grade II , one grade IV ) .
Method	None of these cases required surgical revision at latest follow-up .
Result	In extensive spinal cord decompression through an anterior approach , cervical reconstruction using the present type of cage can achieve clinical results comparable to conventional techniques .
Result	The rigidity of the cage meets biomechanical imperatives .
Result	Its radiolucency permits one to monitor the course of consolidation , contrary to metal cages .
Result	The cases of probable non-fusion and screw breakage were not accompanied by signs of instability on the flexion extension films .
Result	This cage meets the biologic and biomechanical imperatives of cervical reconstruction .
Result	It obviates complications involving bone harvest .

Result	When male weanling rats were fed diets containing either 5 % corn oil or a diet in which half of the corn oil was replaced by fish oil , the 20:5 ( n - 3 ) in liver choline and ethanolamine phosphoglycerides , not only partially replaced arachidonate but also p
Result	The 22:5 ( n - 3 ) / 22:6 ( n - 3 ) ratio in the liver phospholipids of corn oil fed rats was similar to that found when the esterified levels of these two acids were increased 5-fold by feeding fish oil .
Result	Moreover , the pairing of both 22:5 ( n - 3 ) and 22:6 ( n - 3 ) with palmitic and stearic acids , on a molar ratio basis , was relatively independent of the total amount of esterified 22:5 ( n - 3 ) and 22:6 ( n - 3 ) .
Result	When ( 3-14C ) - labeled 22:4 ( n - 6 ) was injected into rats raised on a chow diet or incubated with hepatocytes from these animals , its primary metabolic fate was retroconversion to arachidonate followed by esterification .
Result	Conversely , [ 3-14C ] 22:5 ( n - 3 ) was a poorer substrate for retroconversion with a larger amount being esterified directly into phospholipids and , in addition , this acid served as a precursor for 22:6 ( n - 3 ) .
Result	The enhanced metabolism of both [ 3-14C ] 22:4 ( n - 6 ) to 22:5 ( n - 6 ) and of [ 3-14C ] 22:5 ( n - 3 ) to 22:6 ( n - 3 ) in animals raised on a diet devoid of fat or in their hepatocytes may possibly be due to elevated 6-desaturase activity and/or the level of this enz
Result	This hypothesis is based on studies showing that the synthesis of 22:6 ( n - 3 ) proceeds via a pathway independent of a 4-desaturase but requires the use of a 6-desaturase at two steps ( Voss , A. , Reinhart , M. , Sankarappa , S. and Sprecher , H. ( 1991 ) J. Biol .

Method	In this paper , we present 17 cases with injury of the lower cervical spine associated with widening of the spinal canal .
Background	This was due to bilateral fracture of the pedicles of the neural arch , where the body of the injured vertebra is displaced anteriorly , while the posterior elements of the vertebra remain in situ .
Method	Eleven patients were male and six female , between 32 and 53 years of age .
Background	Ten of them were involved in a road traffic accident , while seven had a fall on the head .
Background	We distinguished two types of injury : Type I with anterior displacement of the injured vertebra ( 12 cases ) and Type II with impaction of the injured vertebral body on the vertebra below ( five cases ) .
Background	Thirteen patients were without neurological complications , two had root lesions , while two had tetraplegia from a point higher than the injury level .
Background	This was due to an extensive anterior displacement of the injured vertebra and of the whole spine above , associated with dislocation of the vertebra above the injury and damage to the spinal cord .
Result	The cases with anterior displacement of the injured vertebra are unstable and need spinal fusion after prior reduction , while the rest can be treated non-operatively with head traction followed by bracing until stable intervertebral union is achieved .

Background	Postoperative rehabilitation for patients who have sustained a laceration to their flexor tendon apparatus is an important factor in maximizing functional outcome .
Background	Quality rehabilitation is characterized by the development of a tailored exercise regimen .
Background	There is currently no model available to tailor an exercise regimen for a person with an atypical physiologic response pattern .
Background	If rehabilitation protocols were classified according to the criteria of forces applied across a tendon juncture and/or excursion , and a clinical method were available to assist in the identification of optimal tendon loading and/or excursion application ,
Method	The author conducted a literature review and case study .
Method	A model for systematic application of progressive loading exercises to the intrasynovial flexor tendon injury and repair is conceptually developed .
Method	The model consists of a pyramidal series of eight specific rehabilitation exercises in the following sequence : passive protected extension , place and hold , active composite fist , hook and straight fist , isolated joint motion , resistive composite fist , res
Method	Concepts are developed to implement a three-point clinical adhesion-grading system .
Method	Clinical application of the system is highlighted .
Result	An excellent outcome was considered 112 % total active motion .
Result	A model for systematic application of progressive loading exercises has been conceptually developed in concert with a method for determination of optimal tendon loading .
Result	Further substantiation is necessary to validate the proposed theory .

Background	The investigation of rodent cocaine self-administration ( SA ) under conditions that promote escalating patterns of intake may provide insight into the loss of control over drug use that is central to human addiction .
Method	This study examines the effects of daily long-access ( LgA ) SA of high or low cocaine doses on drug intake , extinction , reinstatement , and brain mRNA levels .
Method	Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine during multiple-dose sessions .
Method	Short-access ( ShA ) rats were tested daily for multi-dose SA then remained in the chambers for 7 h with no cocaine available .
Method	LgA rats had access to low ( 0.5 mg/kg per infusion ; LgA-LD ) or high ( 2.0 mg/kg per infusion ; LgA-HD ) cocaine doses for 7 h after multi-dose SA .
Method	After 14 days , responding was extinguished , cocaine-induced reinstatement was determined , and preproenkephalin ( ppENK ) , preprodynorphin ( ppDYN ) , corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) and dopamine D ( 2 ) receptor ( D ( 2 ) R ) mRNA levels were measured in various brain regions using a quantitative solution hybridization RNase protection assay .
Result	Whereas SA was not altered in ShA rats and only increased during the `` loading phase '' in LgA-LD rats , a general escalation of intake was found in LgA-HD rats .
Result	LgA , particularly LgA-HD , rats were more susceptible to reinstatement than ShA rats .
Result	Caudate-putamen ppENK and nucleus accumbens D ( 2 ) R mRNA levels were elevated in LgA-HD rats .
Result	Overall , D ( 2 ) R mRNA levels were positively correlated with reinstatement .
Result	The escalation of cocaine SA under LgA conditions is dose-dependent and is associated with heightened susceptibility to drug-induced relapse .
Result	The characterization of neurobiological alterations that accompany escalated SA should facilitate the identification of mechanisms underlying the onset of human addiction .

Background	Acute unilateral L5 pedicle fracture associated with a pre-existing contralateral spondylolysis is a rare lesion .
Method	We report a case in a non-competitive 12-year-old boy .
Method	We present the clinical , radiological and specific management of this rare condition .
Method	The clinical and radiological draft of this patient was reviewed .
Method	The follow-up was 30 months after fracture healing .
Method	Some cases reported in the literature were analyzed and our clinical findings and therapeutic strategy was compared and discussed .
Result	Non-operative treatment was done including full-time bracing in a modified Boston brace incorporating one thigh for 3 months .
Result	Plain radiographs and computed tomographic ( CT ) - scan performed at 3 and 6 months showed progressive healing of the pedicle fracture and no modification of the contralateral isthmic spondylolytic lesion .
Result	At final follow-up , the patient was asymptomatic and resumed all his activities .
Result	In skeletally immature patients , we think that conservative treatment should be considered as a treatment option for this unusual injury .

Background	Three meta-analyses have recently been reported on the relationship between choice of resuscitation fluid and risk of mortality in critically ill patients .
Result	The relative risk of death ( 1.16-1 .19 ) in two of the meta-analyses was slightly higher in colloid than crystalloid recipients ; however , this observation was not statistically significant .
Result	In the third meta-analysis , 6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 3-9 % ) pooled excess mortality was documented in patients receiving albumin for hypovolaemia , burns or hypoalbuminaemia .
Result	The mortality difference in hypovolaemia patients ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0-8 % ) was not statistically significant .
Result	A variety of serious limitations apply to the three meta-analyses , suggesting that their findings be interpreted cautiously .
Result	More than one-half of the randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) included in the meta-analyses were reported prior to 1990 and hence do not reflect current practice .
Result	Each meta-analysis included only a subset of relevant RCTs , and therefore the scope of inferences to be drawn from the meta-analytic results is limited .
Method	The meta-analyses combined RCTs that were notably heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics , type of illness , administered fluids and physiologic endpoints .
Method	Differences in illness severity , concomitant therapies and fluid management approaches were not taken into account .
Method	Very few of the RCTs were blinded .
Result	The meta-analyses do not support the conclusion that choice of resuscitation fluid is a major determinant of mortality in critically ill patients , nor do they support changes to current fluid management practice .
Result	Changes such as exclusive reliance on crystalloids would necessitate a reassessment of the goals and methods of fluid therapy .
Result	Since the effect on mortality may be minimal or non-existent , choice of resuscitation fluid should rest on whether the particular fluid permits the intensive care unit to provide better patient care .

Background	We outline a transactional model of parent-child interactions which proposes that characteristics of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) appear early in a child 's life and present challenges to the parent 's ability to maintain consistent and r
Background	In turn , the presence of harsh or inconsistent parenting is hypothesized to contribute to the development of child oppositional behaviour and conduct problems .
Method	We briefly discuss existing cross-sectional evidence in support of this model and then highlight five longitudinal studies that provide stronger support , showing that difficulties in parenting predict the development of oppositional and conduct problems i
Result	We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of this model and evidence , emphasizing the need for early interventions in ADHD focused on parenting .

Background	Spastic equinovarus deformity of the ankle in adults with acquired brain injury can severely limit the achievement of rehabilitation goals .
Method	This study examined changes in triceps surae muscle extensibility , passive resistive torque and soleus stretch reflex responses in 10 adult brain injured subjects undergoing serial casting to correct ankle equinovarus deformity .
Method	Goniometric measurement of maximal passive dorsiflexion was used to evaluate extensibility of the triceps surae muscles .
Method	Computer controlled ankle dynamometry and surface electromyography were used to identify passive resistive torque and soleus stretch reflex onset angle in response to stretches at two velocities .
Method	The mean casting period was 5 weeks .
Result	Casting was discontinued in one subject due to failure to achieve measurable gain in ankle range over three consecutive cast changes .
Result	Median improvements in maximal ankle dorsiflexion , with the knee flexed or extended , of 30 degrees and 15 degrees , respectively , were achieved in the remaining nine subjects ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Result	The median passive ankle range in response to a displacing torque of 10 Nm increased 4.3 degrees over the intervention period ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Result	Consistent soleus reflex activity in response to passive stretches at 25 degrees x s ( -1 ) was elicited in only four subjects .
Result	A trend for the stretch reflex onset to move further into the available range was demonstrated in these subjects .
Result	In the present study , serial casting contributed to significant change in triceps surae extensibility and passive resistive torque , corresponding with improved maximal passive ankle dorsiflexion range and an increase in the angle achieved with a displacin
Result	Increased stretch reflex threshold was observed in some subjects .
Result	The use of pre-determined outcome criteria and careful measurement of responses to this intervention were important to prevent premature discontinuation of casting when gains were slower than expected .

Background	Large outbreaks of Legionella pneumonia are rare , but when they occur provide an opportunity to assess predictors of mortality and efficacy of drug therapy .
Background	Although erythromycin has been the treatment of choice for many years , newer antimicrobials with increased activity against Legionella are available .
Background	A large outbreak of legionnaires ' disease associated with the Melbourne Aquarium occurred in April 2000 .
Method	To describe the patterns and impact of Legionella therapy , and predictors of outcome in a large group of hospitalized patients with legionnaires ' disease .
Method	A 6-month retrospective audit of hospitalized patients with proven legionnaires ' disease around the time of the Melbourne Aquarium outbreak was conducted .
Method	Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 8.0 ( SAS Institute Inc. , NC , USA ) .
Method	Data were obtained on 104 patients ( 71 aquarium related , 33 not related ) .
Result	There were six deaths ( mortality rate 5.8 % ) , three of which were attributable directly to progressive legionnaires ' disease .
Result	The major predictors of death were pre-existing cardiac failure ( P = 0.0035 ) and renal disease ( P = 0.026 ) .
Result	Erythro-mycin is still the most commonly used antibiotic ( 80 % received i.v. erythromycin ) with clinicians prescribing more than one active Legionella drug in the majority of cases ( 76 % ) .
Result	Choice of initial antibiotic therapy did not statistically affect outcome as measured by death , length of hospital stay or time to defervescence , although there was a trend towards improved survival with i.v. erythromycin ( P = 0.063 ) .
Result	Intravenous erythromycin was associated with a 19 % rate of phlebitis , whereas side-effects from other antibiotics were uncommon .
Result	The most commonly used Legionella therapy in Australia remains erythromycin .
Result	This continues to be an effective agent , however , side-effects are common .

Background	To establish reliability of quantitative measures of elbow joint spastic hypertonia in post-stroke hemiparesis .
Method	Nine subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis ( mn duration : 42 months ) were tested on three separate days .
Method	Biceps brachii and brachioradialis EMG were recorded during passive ramp-and-hold extensions applied at seven speeds between 30 and 210 degrees / s.
Method	EMG burst duration , onset position threshold , and burst intensity were used to evaluate reflex activity .
Method	Torque at 40 degrees of elbow flexion was used as a mechanical indicator of spastic hypertonia .
Result	Across speeds ICCs were consistent , means ranged between 0.63 and 0.85 .
Result	Thus , relative reliability was fair to excellent for all parameters .
Result	Absolute reliability , determined using standard error of measurement expressed as a percentage of the mean score ( % SEM ) , improved at higher speeds ( > or = 120 degrees/s ) .
Result	These results establish reliability of reflex and mechanical measures of elbow spastic hypertonia post-stroke .
Result	The data demonstrate greater reflex detection at high speeds , indicating greater potential to document meaningful changes in these distinct aspects of spastic hypertonia following intervention .
Result	Based on findings of this study , reliability was demonstrated using four parameters of reflex EMG and torque indicating measurement consistency across sessions .
Result	These observations motivate determination of requisite effect sizes for clinical trials that evaluate treatment outcome .

Method	We report results from a multicenter , placebo-controlled , randomized , double-blind comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine and fluoxetine in outpatients with major depression .
Method	Across five U.S. sites , 128 outpatients ( mean age : 41.3 + / - 12.6 ; 63 men and 65 women ) with moderate to moderately severe major depression without a history of mania or hypomania were recruited between 1993 and 1994 .
Method	All 128 patients completed a 1-week placebo washout period , and were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with paroxetine up to 50 mg/day ( n = 55 ) , fluoxetine up to 80 mg/day ( n = 54 ) , or placebo ( n = 19 ) .
Method	Subjects were evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks , then at weeks 6 , 9 , and 12 with the 21-item HAMD and the Covi Anxiety Scale .
Result	There were no significant differences among the three treatment groups in baseline and endpoint depression and anxiety severity , as well as in the degree of depression and anxiety improvement .
Result	There were no statistically significant differences in rates or mean numbers of adverse events between paroxetine-treated patients and fluoxetine-treated patients .
Result	In summary , our results , although limited by the lack of a significant difference from placebo in treatment outcome , suggest that the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine have comparable antidepressant and antianxiety efficacies among depressed outpatients , as

Background	Stress ( insufficient ) sacral bone fracture is a seriously painful disease with discussed and disunited therapy .
Background	Older women sufferig from osteoporosis create the main group in which this fracture occurs .
Background	Clinically , serious pain in sacral area is the most common symptome .
Background	This pain may last for a long time when treated conservatively and it can lead to pacient 's immobilization with related comorbidity .
Background	In 2 % of patients , neurological complications can be observed .
Method	Authors present summary of published studies and demonstrate an own case treated using percutaneous sacroplasty .

Background	This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical uses of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) for functional and therapeutic applications in subjects with spinal cord injury or stroke .
Method	Functional applications refer to the use of NMES to activate paralyzed muscles in precise sequence and magnitude to directly accomplish functional tasks .
Result	In therapeutic applications , NMES may lead to a specific effect that enhances function , but does not directly provide function .
Method	The specific neuroprosthetic or `` functional '' applications reviewed in this article include upper - and lower-limb motor movement for self-care tasks and mobility , respectively , bladder function , and respiratory control .
Result	Specific therapeutic applications include motor relearning , reduction of hemiplegic shoulder pain , muscle strengthening , prevention of muscle atrophy , prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis , improvement of tissue oxygenation and peripheral hemodynamic func
Result	Perspectives on future developments and clinical applications of NMES are presented .

Background	The main objective was to assess how group premiums can help poor people in the informal economy prepay for health care services .
Method	A comparative approach was adopted to study four groups of informal economy operators ( cobblers , welders , carpenters , small scale market retailers ) focusing on a method of prepayment which could help them access health care services .
Method	Two groups with a total of 714 operators were organized to prepay for health care services through a group premium , while the other two groups with a total of 702 operators were not organized to prepay through this approach .
Method	They prepaid through individual premium , each operator paying from his or her sources .
Method	Data on the four groups which lived in the same city was collected through a questionnaire and focus group discussions .
Method	Data collected was focused on health problems , health seeking behaviour and payment for health care services .
Method	Training of all the groups on prepaid health care financing based on individual based premium payment and group based premium payment was done .
Method	Groups were then free to choose which method to use in prepaying for health care .
Method	Prepayment through the two methods was then observed over a period of three years .
Method	Trends of membership attrition and retention were documented for both approaches .
Result	Data collected showed that the four groups were similar in many respects .
Result	These similarities included levels of education , housing , and social services such as water supplies , health problems , family size and health seeking behaviour .
Result	At the end of a period of three years 76 % of the members from the two groups who chose group premium payment were still members of the prepayment health scheme and were receiving health care .
Result	For the two groups which opted for individual premium payment only 15 % of their members were still receiving health care services at the end of three years .
Result	Group premium is a useful tool in improving accessibility to health care services in the poorer segments of the population especially the informal economy operators

Background	Recurrent depression poses a problem for up to 80 % of patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) during their lifetime .
Background	Therefore , the optimal treatment goal established by the American Psychiatric Association and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is remission and virtual elimination of symptoms .
Background	Patients who have a high risk of recurrence often require maintenance therapy and long-term treatment .
Background	As a result , identification of antidepressants that are effective in maintaining remission in patients over the long-term and have acceptable tolerability profiles is important .
Background	The efficacy of antidepressants in conferring full remission and long-term recovery is an important priority for clinicians .
Method	Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) have been examined for use in long-term treatment of MDD .
Method	Recently , 2 long-term ( 6 to 12 months ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies have shown that venlafaxine is effective in preventing relapse and recurrence .
Result	While long-term , head-to-head studies comparing SNRIs with SSRIs are rare , a recent open-label study compared venlafaxine to 4 SSRIs ( fluoxetine , paroxetine , sertraline , or citalopram ) in outpatients with MDD .
Result	The results show that the SNRI venlafaxine is comparable to the SSRIs in terms of remission rates , and venlafaxine may bring patients to remission earlier than SSRIs .
Result	Long-term treatment at maximally tolerated doses is also associated with similar incidence of common adverse events between venlafaxine and placebo and tolerability comparable to SSRIs .
Result	Thus , there is increasing evidence that venlafaxine and SSRIs are effective and well tolerated in long-term therapy .
Result	While it is unclear from the data if continued treatment with SNRIs confers advantages over SSRIs due to an early onset of remission , further studies will provide valuable insights into the efficacy of SNRIs and SSRIs in maintenance therapy .

Method	The radiographic and clinical results of two different anterior structural grafts were compared in 38 patients who had combined anterior-posterior revision surgery for failed lumbar fusion .
Background	Failed lumbar fusion surgery , such as pseudarthrosis or flatback deformity , may result in disabling pain .
Background	The optimum revision technique has yet to be defined .
Background	The authors of the current study sought to determine which of two different types of anterior graft yields the best results .
Background	Posterior procedures for revision of a failed lumbar fusion have not yielded reliably successful results .
Background	A combined anterior-posterior approach may be effective in restoring sagittal balance and enhancing fusion rates .
Background	Recent studies have shown femoral ring allografts to be effective in lumbar fusion revision , but no studies have compared these with other types of structural grafts .
Method	Thirty-eight patients with pseudarthrosis were treated with combined anterior-posterior lumbar spine fusion using either femoral ring allografts ( 26 patients ) or tricortical iliac autografts ( 12 patients ) .
Method	Radiographic follow-up examination and retrospective patient self-assessment questionnaires were used to evaluate outcomes .
Method	Results were assessed by independent reviewers after a mean follow-up period of 35 months .
Result	Radiographic follow-up examination revealed acceptably low pseudarthrosis rates for structural autografts ( 0 % ) and allografts ( 6 % ) .
Result	The questionnaires revealed significant improvement in pain for both groups .
Result	Allograft patients showed greater improvement in function , less pain medication usage , and higher overall success rates ( 83 % ) than autograft patients ( 64 % ) .
Result	Femoral ring allografts are as effective , clinically and radiographically , as tricortical iliac autografts when used as an anterior structural element in revision lumbar spine fusion in patients who have undergone multiple surgical procedures for pseudart
Result	The slightly greater improvement for the allograft group needs to be confirmed in a larger study .

Background	To determine the effect of iNO , compared with inhaled placebo , on outcome in AHRF in children and/or adults .
Method	Randomised controlled trials ( RCT 's ) were identified from electronic databases ; MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library , and CINAHL , as well as from bibliographies of retrieved articles .
Method	Relevant journals and conference proceedings were hand searched and authors published in this field were contacted for knowledge of unpublished ongoing trials .
Method	RCT 's comparing iNO with maximal conventional therapy and inhaled placebo , for AHRF in either children or adults .
Method	Data were extracted and the analyses performed independently by two reviewers .
Method	All 5 authors were contacted for missing data .
Method	Qualitative assessment of each trial was made according to methodology described by Schulz ( Schulz 1995 ) , and analyses according to statistical methods in Review Manager MetaView 3.1 .
Method	The fixed effect model was applied .
Method	Where possible , sub-group analyses were performed to assess the impact of iNO in varied doses .
Result	Five RCT 's were evaluated , assessing 535 patients with AHRF .
Result	Inhaled nitric oxide made no impact on mortality in trials without cross-over ( RR 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.66 , 1.44 ) , or with cross-over of treatment failures to open-label iNO ( RR 1.22 , 95 % CI 0.65 , 2.29 ) .
Result	Published evidence from one study demonstrated that iNO resulted in a transient improvement in oxygenation in the first 24 hours of treatment : the oxygenation index ( OI ) showed a mean difference of -3 [ 95 % CI -5.354 , -0.646 ] , and PaO2/FiO2 ratio , a mean d
Result	Limited data demonstrated no difference in ventilator-free days between treatment and placebo groups , and no specific dose of iNO was significantly advantageous over another .
Result	Other clinical indicators of effectiveness , such as duration of hospital and intensive care stay , were inconsistently reported .
Result	There were no complications reported to be directly attributable to this treatment .
Result	From the data provided to date , iNO had no effect on mortality and only transiently improved oxygenation in AHRF in children and/or adults .
Method	There was a lack of data to assess other end points .
Result	The long term adverse effects of this drug are not known , as no long term follow-up of trial participants has been reported .
Result	If further trials comparing iNO with an inhaled placebo are to proceed , they should be stratified for primary disease and must specifically evaluate clinically relevant outcomes , before any benefit of iNO in AHRF can be excluded .

Method	The laparoscopic findings , treatment , and follow-up of 25 patients who failed artificial insemination donor ( AID ) were retrospectively evaluated .
Result	A high incidence ( 72 % ) of abnormal pelvic findings was encountered .
Result	Endometriosis was found in 60 % and pelvic adhesions in 12 % of the patients .
Result	The incidence of these two entities was not significantly different from their incidence in patients with unexplained infertility in the same institution ( 44 % for endometriosis and 36 % for adhesions ) .
Result	After surgical or medical treatment , a pregnancy rate of 22.2 % ( 16.6 % for endometriosis and 66.6 % for pelvic adhesions ) was achieved in patients with positive pelvic findings ; in the group with negative pelvic findings , a pregnancy rate of 20 % was achieve
Result	The value of diagnostic laparoscopy in AID failures is discussed in the light of the findings presented and the relatively low rate of post-treatment pregnancy.americasartificial inseminationdeveloped countriesendoscopyexaminations and diagnosesgenital ef

Background	Neuroendocrine tumours of the colon and rectum are rare but distinct with regard to clinical symptoms , diagnostic and therapeutic management and prognosis compared to other neuroendocrine tumours of the gut as well as ordinary colorectal cancer .
Background	Therapeutic algorithms are proposed depending mainly on analogous TNM categories and grading considering conventional and experimental surgical and non-surgical therapy .
Background	Colonic neuroendocrine tumours are often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and are therefore not properly treated with adjuvant and additive chemotherapy .
Background	As most rectal neuroendocrine tumours are benign because of submucosal extension only , the size and infiltration depth correlates with lymph-node and distant metastases and therefore with the prognosis .
Background	It is unknown whether endoscopic ultrasound can improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to size-related conclusions , and therefore whether it can change therapeutic strategies and improve survival by modern rectal surgery .

Background	There is significant controversy surrounding attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Background	While the existence of this disorder is generally accepted , debate continues in relation to aspects of assessment , as well as the effectiveness and choice of treatment options and their continuation into adult life .
Background	Management is further complicated as people with ADHD often have chaotic lives which impedes medication compliance and motivation to continue treatment vacillates .
Background	Concern also exists over the misuse of amphetamine-like medications by some patients .
Method	This case study does not provide comprehensive information on current diagnosis and ADHD treatment guidelines , but explores the issues and management role of general practitioners treating patients with ADHD .
Result	The diagnosis of ADHD is common , and many patients are managed using a range of social and behavioural interventions that are commonly combined with pharmacotherapies ( provided in the main by psychiatrists and paediatricians ) .
Result	However , while specialists may appropriately choose not to treat where a diagnosis is unclear , or discontinue treatment for reasons such as doubtful response to treatment , possible medication misuse , concurrent illicit drug use or poor motivation , GPs fre
Result	When the specialist formulation suggests there is little to gain from further treatment , the GP is likely to be the sole health professional remaining engaged in support and ongoing management .

Background	Prospective evaluation of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures concerning pain reduction , demand of analgesics and quality of life .
Method	In 26 consecutive patients , 50 vertebral fractures were treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty under fluoroscopic ( n = 44 ) or combined fluoroscopic/CT guidance ( n = 6 ) .
Method	Prospective follow-up was performed after 6 ( for 50 vertebral fractures ) and 12 months ( for 27 vertebral fractures ) .
Method	Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and numeric rating scale ( NRS ) was applied for the assessment of pain .
Method	Subjective quality of life and analgesics demand was documented semi-quantitatively .
Result	Mean interval from the beginning of pain symptoms to therapy was 8.5 weeks .
Result	Vertebroplasty was technically successful in all evaluated patients .
Result	Pain severity decreased from 10 ( defined at baseline as initial pain score ) to 2.8 after 6 months and 2.7 after 12 months .
Result	Subjective quality of life was reported as very well , well or improved in 92 % ( n = 26 after 6 months ) or 100 % ( n = 13 after 12 months ) .
Result	No need for additional analgesic therapy was observed in 69.3 % ( n = 26 ) after 6 months and 61.5 % ( n = 13 ) after 12 months .
Result	Eight newly developed vertebral fractures were observed during follow-up , with 5 fractures directly adjacent to previously treated vertebrae .
Result	Leakage of polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) into the intervertebral space or spinal canal was observed in 22 % and 20 % respectively ( n = 50 vertebrae ) .
Result	No neurologic deterioration or complications requiring surgery were observed .
Result	Vertebroplasty is a successful therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures .
Result	Persistent improvement of clinical symptoms was shown at follow-up after 6 and 12 months .

Background	This is the editorial note on a report dealing with birth planning in China .
Background	The report is a compilation of trip report excerpts and journal notes written by visitors to China in the 1977-79 period .
Background	For those in the population field , China is extremely interesting because it has managed to reduce its population growth rate significantly in recent years .
Result	The following aspects seem to account for this success on the population front : 1 ) use of paramedics and barefoot doctors to provide family planning service to all communities ; 2 ) availability of a wide range of contraceptive methods , including abortion a

Background	The importance of maternal dietary fatty acids on arachidonic acid [ AA ; 20:4 ( n-6 ) ] and docosahexaenoic acid [ DHA ; 22:6 ( n-3 ) ] in fetal brain nerve growth cone membranes and monoaminergic neurotransmitters was investigated .
Method	Rats were fed purified diets containing 20 g/100 g safflower oil with 74.3 % 18:2 ( n-6 ) , 0.2 % 18:3 ( n-3 ) , soybean oil with 55.4 % 18:2 ( n-6 ) , 7.7 % 18:3 ( n-3 ) or high fish oil with 24.6 % 22:6 ( n-3 ) through gestation .
Method	Tissue for rats within a litter were pooled at birth , brain growth cone membranes prepared and phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) and phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) fatty acids quantified by gas-liquid chromatography .
Method	Dopamine , serotonin , and the metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid , and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid were quantified by HPLC .
Result	Growth cone membranes from offspring of rats fed safflower oil had significantly lower , and offspring of rats fed high 22:6 ( n-3 ) fish oil had significantly higher 22:6 ( n-3 ) in PE , PS and PI than the soybean oil group .
Result	The growth cone membrane PC , PE and PS 20:4 ( n-6 ) was significantly lower in the fish oil than in the soybean or safflower oil groups .
Result	Serotonin concentration was significantly higher in brain of offspring in the safflower oil compared with the soybean oil group .
Result	The newborn brain dopamine was inversely related to PE DHA and PS DHA ( P < 0.001 ) , but positively related to PC AA ( P < 0.05 ) .
Result	These studies show that maternal dietary fatty acids may alter fetal brain growth cone ( n-6 ) and ( n-3 ) fatty acids , and neurotransmitters involved in neurite extension , target finding and synaptogenesis .
Result	The functional importance , however , is not known at this time .

Background	Adult mammal sensory axons avulsed through spinal dorsal root traction injuries , especially of the brachial plexus or cauda equina , can not normally regenerate through axonal outgrowth from the DRG into the spinal cord , thus causing clinical conditions tha
Method	To evaluate the sensory recovery of the forelimb after transection of their left cervical dorsal and ventral roots ( C6-C8 ) at their spinal cord junctions , 22 SD rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups : transection only ( control 1 ) ; transection followed by
Method	The following tests were reperformed after retransecting the repaired nerve roots to discount collateral innervation from adjacent nerve roots : motor function ( grasping power ) , mechanical sensitivity to pain and touch ( foot-withdrawal response to mechanic
Result	After transection and repair , the experimental group rats showed recovery in both motor ( grasping power ) and sensory ( touch , pain , and temperature sensation ) nerve functions .
Result	Neuronal regeneration was confirmed by the reappearance of cortical SEP and by its disappearance after retransection of the repaired cervical nerve roots .
Result	Using our strategy for repairing transected cervical nerve roots , motor and sensory recovery was achieved in adult rats .
Result	The success of our study highlights possible treatment options for humans with avulsion injuries of the dorsal roots from the spinal cord .

Background	A positive deviance ( PD ) inquiry identifies uncommon , model practices that a follow-on program can spread .
Background	PD has been used to rehabilitate malnourished children , but not for improving newborn health .
Background	Save the Children Federation/US ( SC ) conducted newborn PD cycles in communities ( total population about 5,000 each ) in two project areas in Haripur District , Pakistan among Afghan refugees and among local Pakistanis .
Background	Each PD cycle included planning , community orientation , situation analysis , PD inquiries , and community feedback with action planning .
Method	PD inquiries were in-depth interviews to identify uncommon behaviors among surviving asphyxiated newborns , thriving low birthweight babies , surviving newborns who had danger signs , and normal newborns .
Result	The Afghan caregivers showed better use of services and some household practices than their Pakistani counterparts , consistent with duration of SC presence ( 15 years vs. 18 months , respectively ) .
Result	The practices of both groups for clean delivery , thermal control , immediate and exclusive breastfeeding , and fathers ' involvement were weak .
Result	But PD individuals , families , and/or birth attendants modeled good maternal care and immediate , routine and special newborn care .
Result	Communities enthusiastically committed to change behavior and form neighborhood support groups for better newborn care , including a demand for hygienic delivery .
Result	The PD approach for the newborn is more complex than for child nutrition .

Background	It was questioned whether this pattern of cervical musculoskeletal impairment could discriminate a cervicogenic headache as one type of headache in more complex situations when persons report two or more headaches .
Method	Subjects with two or more concurrent frequent intermittent headache types ( n = 108 ) and 57 non-headache control subjects were assessed using a set of physical measures for the cervical musculoskeletal system .
Method	Discriminant and cluster analyses revealed that 36 subjects had the pattern of musculoskeletal impairment consistent with cervicogenic headache .
Result	Isolated features of physical impairment , e.g. range of movement ( cervical extension ) , were not helpful in differentiating cervicogenic headache .
Result	There were no differences in measures of cervical musculoskeletal impairment undertaken in this study between control subjects and those classified with non-cervicogenic headaches .

Background	Telemedicine can be defined as the electronic transfer of medical information to remote sites in order to support patient care and medical education ( Norton et al , 1997 ) .
Background	The concept of telemedicine has been around for more than 20 years ; however , with the advantages of affordable technology it is set to play a major role in the future of health care .
Background	The use of telemedicine within the field of dermatological practice is well documented in the literature but the use of this referral system by clinical nurse specialists in tissue viability appears to be in its infancy .
Background	This article seeks to dispel the myths around the use of technology to enhance clinical practice and uses the authors ' personal experience to describe its effectiveness for referring patients with complex tissue viability needs .
