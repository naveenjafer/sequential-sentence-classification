Background	Postmenopausal bleeding ( PMB ) accounts for about 5 % of all office gynaecology visits .
Background	The causes of PMB are varied .
Background	Many women with endometrial cancer present with this symptom .
Background	Although many investigations are described , the most appropriate approach is often unclear .
Background	In a patient with no obvious local cause , the emphasis should be on uterine and adnexal evaluation .
Background	Based on a literature review , the evidence favours a conservative approach if the endometrial thickness ( ET ) is < 4mm , unless there are risk factors .
Result	All patients with ET 4 mm should have outpatient endometrial sampling .
Result	If this is unsuccessful , then outpatient hysteroscopy with directed biopsy or inpatient hysteroscopy is favoured .
Result	The role of ancillary investigations are described .

Background	Orexin-A has been reported to produce an analgesic effect in the hot plate test and in the inflammatory pain models .
Method	In the present study , the authors examined the effect of orexin-A on the mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation ( a model of neuropathic pain ) in the rat .
Method	Partial sciatic nerve ligation is created by tight ligation of one-third or one-half of the right sciatic nerve .
Method	Orexin-A was administered intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly 7 days after a partial sciatic nerve injury .
Method	Either intrathecal or intracerebroventricular injection of orexin-A attenuated the level of mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation .
Result	These data suggest that either intrathecal or intracerebroventricular injection of orexin-A is a new therapeutic approach to treating mechanical allodynia caused by nerve injury .

Background	The main objective of this study was to compare a `` traditional '' test of memory , the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised ( WMS-R ; Wechsler , 1987 ) with a behavioral evaluation test , the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test ( RBMT ; Wilson , Cockburn , & Bad
Method	Eighty volunteers participated in the study and were divided into four groups : 20 older adults with memory problems , 20 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy , 20 patients with Alzheimer ' s disease , and 20 controls .
Method	A Spanish translation and adaptation of the WMS-R and a Spanish version of the RBMT were used .
Result	The results indicated that the RBMT was as robust as the WMS-R in differential discrimination of patients .

Background	This is a review of the impact of spinal cord injury on female sexuality , which has received far less attention than male sexuality , and on menstruation , contraception and pregnancy , which have been reported more extensively .
Result	The few reports of sexuality in women after spinal cord injury suggests a wide range of adaptability , from 40 % to 88 % of the subjects achieving satisfactory sexual activity .
Result	Some women were able to adapt a positive body image and find new ways of stimulation to orgasm , despite altered body shape , bladder and bowel incontinence , spasticity , and lack of sensation often resulting from spinal injury .
Result	The pill , vaginal methods , and IUDs are not recommended , but condoms and possibly Norplant , are appropriate for these women .
Result	Menstruation , often ceasing for several months after injury , usually resumes .
Result	One study reported lack of menstrual pain , others did not .
Result	Many spinal injuries women have achieved 1 or more pregnancies .
Result	A few cases have been described of successful pregnancy when the injury occurred during gestation , as has 1 intrauterine death that was successfully delivered by induction .
Result	Premature cervical dilatation and labor and small-for-dates infants are more common than usual , but spontaneous abortion are not .
Result	Some of the typical problems in pregnancy are urinary tract infections , decubiti , anemia , pedal edema , weight transfer problems , thrombophlebitis , TIA episodes , and nausea .
Result	A more serious problem is management of labor , especially if the woman can not perceive labor pains , or can not bear down .
Result	Frequent check-ups and early hospitalization are recommended .
Result	A potentially fatal risk in those injured at T6 or above , is autonomic dysreflexia , stimulated by induction , labor , delivery , or even breast feeding .
Result	Autonomic dysreflexia can be treated with epidural anesthesia with lidocaine .
Result	Induction is contraindicated .
Result	Lactation may cease after 3 months or so because of lack of nipple stimulation .

Background	We developed a patient centred approach to chronic disease self management by providing information designed to promote patient choice .
Background	We then conducted a randomised controlled trial of the approach in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) to assess whether it could alter clinical outcome and affect health service use .
Method	A multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial .
Method	The trial was conducted in the outpatient departments of 19 hospitals with randomisation by treatment centre , 10 control sites , and nine intervention sites .
Method	For patients at intervention sites , an individual self management plan was negotiated and written information provided .
Method	A total of 700 patients with established inflammatory bowel disease were recruited .
Method	Main outcome measures recorded at one year were quality of life , health service resource use , and patient satisfaction .
Method	Secondary outcomes included measures of enablement-confidence to cope with the condition .
Result	One year following the intervention , self managing patients had made fewer hospital visits ( difference -1.04 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -1.43 to -0.65 ) ; p < 0.001 ) without increase in the number of primary care visits , and quality of life was maintain
Result	The two groups were similar with respect to satisfaction with consultations .
Result	Immediately after the initial consultation , those who had undergone self management training reported greater confidence in being able to cope with their condition ( difference 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.12-1 .68 ) ; p < 0.03 ) .
Result	Adoption of this approach for the management of chronic disease such as IBD in the NHS and other managed health care organisations would considerably reduce health provision costs and benefit disease control .

Method	Fifty four cases of acute large bowel obstruction were observed in an overall groups of 266 patients with colonic carcinoma .
Background	Pre-operative elements which seems to contra-indicate a primary radical surgery and advantages of the same procedure are considered .
Result	In the experience of the Authors , primary and delayed staged resection of the cancer seems to give the same survival rate at short and long term .
Result	Choice of surgery of obstructive large bowel carcinoma should be based pratically on general patient 's conditions .

Background	The commissioning of healthcare services is increasingly linked to the availability of rigorous evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness .
Background	In the current climate , ` rigorous evidence ' is synonymous with the randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) .
Background	Consequently , health technologies are often funded in preference to service developments due to an imbalance in the availability of strong evidence to support service developments .
Background	Simultaneously , there is an increasing policy emphasis on patient choice and individualized care in the NHS .
Background	In this paper Bill Watson , Susan Procter and Wendy Cochrane discuss the implications of using experimental methods in service development research , with reference to an ongoing RCT evaluating the component parts of pulmonary rehabilitation in people with

Method	The goal of this study was to examine whether higher consumption of total linolenic acid was associated with rate-adjusted QT and JT intervals ( QTrr and JTrr , respectively ) .
Background	Higher intake of fish omega-3 fatty acids and plant omega-3 such as alpha-linolenic acid is associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction .
Background	While long-chain omega-3 can inhibit ventricular arrhythmia , it is not known whether alpha-linolenic acid influences ventricular repolarization .
Method	We studied 3,642 subjects from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Family Heart study who were free of myocardial infarction , left ventricular hypertrophy , pacemaker , and with QRS < 120 ms.
Method	We used the 95th percentile of the gender-specific distribution of QTrr and JTrr to define abnormally prolonged repolarization .
Method	Within each gender , we created age - and energy-adjusted tertiles of linolenic acid and used regression models for analyses .
Result	Mean age was 50 years , and average intake of total linolenic acid was 0.74 g/day .
Result	There was an inverse association between consumption of linolenic acid and QTrr and JTrr ( p for trend 0.001 and 0.0005 , respectively ) .
Result	From the lowest ( reference ) to the highest gender - , age - , and energy-adjusted tertile of linolenic acid , multivariable adjusted odds ratios for prolonged QTrr were 1.0 , 0.74 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.57 to 0.96 ) , and 0.59 ( 95 % CI 0.44 to 0.77 ) , resp
Result	Corresponding values for JTrr were 1.0 , 0.73 ( 95 % CI 0.52 to 1.03 ) , and 0.59 ( 95 % CI 0.40 to 0.87 ) , respectively ( p for trend 0.009 ) .
Result	Exclusion of subjects taking drugs known to influence QT did not influence this association .
Result	Higher intake of dietary linolenic acid might be associated with a reduced risk of abnormally prolonged repolarization in men and women .

Background	Congenital muscular torticollis is due to fibrosis of one or both the heads of sternocleidomastoid muscle .
Background	This may also involve the platysma , scalene muscles , and the carotid sheath and may be associated with cervical scoliosis .
Background	Conventional surgical procedures leave visible scars .
Method	Ramirez , who used the posterior part of the traditional face-lift incision , made perhaps the first attempt at concealing scars .
Method	Burstein et al. reported a large series of subcutaneous endoscopic release of torticollis through a hairline approach .
Method	Sasaki described an endoscopic two-incision , posterior auricular fold and hairline approach .
Method	A technique of transaxillary subcutaneous endoscopy for the release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in congenital muscular torticollis is described here .
Method	This procedure provides direct access to the fibrous bands , enables release without risk of damage to the spinal accessory nerve , external jugular vein , or greater auricular nerve , and leaves no visible neck scars .
Result	Two cases of congenital muscular torticollis presenting in adulthood were managed successfully by this technique .
Result	The fibrotic part of sternocleidomastoid muscle was released and the normal range of head motion was restored .
Result	There were no surgical complications encountered and the patients achieved complete pain free range of movement in six weeks .
Result	This technique provides direct and quick access , perpendicular to the line of the fibrotic bands , avoids injury to neurovascular structures and does not leave visible neck scars .

Method	1 .
Result	Field electrical stimulation elicited an increase of the tritium efflux over the basal level from cat cerebral arteries previously incubated with ( + / - ) [ 3H ] noradrenaline ( [ 3H ] NA ) .
Method	2 .
Result	This efflux was : ( a ) reduced by clonidine , NA or B-HT 920 ; ( b ) unaffected by methoxamine , prazosin and yohimbine ( 10 ( -6 ) M ) ; ( c ) reduced by yohimbine ( 5 x 10 ( -6 ) M ) , and ( d ) increased by phentolamine .
Method	3 .
Result	The effect of clonidine was blocked by yohimbine .
Method	4 .
Result	The daily treatment with the neuronal uptake blockers desipramine ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) or cocaine ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) [ during 12 days ] , antagonized the inhibitory action of clonidine totally or partially , respectively .
Method	5 .
Result	These results suggest : ( 1 ) the existence of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in these arteries , which modulate the NA release , and ( 2 ) that chronic treatment with desipramine or cocaine induces a subsensitivity of these alpha 2-receptors , which facilitat

Background	Chronic progressive disorders of the central nervous system ( CNS ) impose diagnostic problems , particularly in younger patients .
Background	The demonstration of antibodies against measles virus ( MV ) in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) plays a major role in the laboratory diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) as well as multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Method	Because intrathecally synthesized antibodies against MV can be found in both diseases , it is necessary to establish easy and reliable methods to improve the differential diagnosis .
Method	Seventy-one paired serum/CSF samples obtained from patients with the diagnosis of SSPE ( n = 23 ) , MS ( n = 14 ) , or acute postinfectious measles encephalitis ( APME , n = 8 ) have been examined .
Method	The reactivity of intrathecally synthesized immunoglobulin to individual recombinant MV structural proteins was assessed using Western blot analysis , ELISA as well as isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) .
Result	All CSF samples obtained from patients suffering from SSPE showed a strong antibody response to MV-nucleocapsid ( N ) and phosphoprotein ( P ) .
Result	Sera from 15 of the 23 SSPE patients were reactive to MV-fusion protein ( F ) .
Result	Faint reactivity was obtained against MV-matrix ( M ) or hemagglutinin protein ( H ) in the minority of samples ( 40 and 20 % , respectively ) .
Result	CSF samples of MS patients only revealed a clear response to N , and in two cases to F.
Result	The other proteins were not recognized in the CSF samples of MS patients .
Result	In contrast to SSPE , the IEF of CSF from MS patients revealed only few MV-specific oligoclonal bands .
Result	In the CSF samples from APME patients , intrathecal MV antibodies were not detected .
Result	This study shows that discrimination between SSPE and MS can be achieved in doubtful cases by IEF using MV-N , P and F proteins .

Background	In about 20 % of MS patients an increased CSF/serum albumin quotient ( QAlb ) has been observed .
Background	The reason for this blood-CSF barrier dysfunction is yet unclear .
Method	QAlb values from 48 MS patients in relapse were correlated with parameters of active CNS lesions as measured by gadolinium-DTPA MRIs .
Method	QAlb values from 20 MS patients without relapse served as controls .
Result	Mean QAlb values ( x 10 ( 3 ) of a group with spinal cord lesions ( 7.6 + / - 3.6 ; n = 16 ) differed significantly from those of a control group ( 4.6 + / - 1.5 ; n = 20 ; p < 0.005 ) as well as from those of a group with supratentorial lesions ( 5.0 + / - 1.8 ; n = 18 ;
Result	QAlb values of patients with a spinal lesion tended to decrease with increasing time intervals between onset of relapse and lumbar puncture .
Result	The data is in consent with the present knowledge on flow dynamics of both extracellular fluid and CSF .
Result	As a clinical consequence , increased QAlb values in MS patients may hint at an active spinal or , less likely , infratentorial lesion .

Background	Obesity is now one of our major public health problems .
Background	Effective and acceptable treatment options are needed .
Background	The Lap-Band system is placed laparoscopically and allows adjustment of the level of gastric restriction .
Method	A prospective study of 709 severely obese patients was conducted over a 6-year period at a university-based multidisciplinary referral center .
Method	After extensive preoperative evaluation , patients with a body mass index > 35 were treated by Lap-Band placement .
Method	Close follow-up with progressive adjustment of gastric restriction continued permanently .
Method	Medical co-morbidities were monitored as part of comprehensive prospective data collection .
Result	There have been no deaths perioperatively or during follow-up .
Result	Significant perioperative adverse events occurred in 1.2 % only .
Result	Reoperation has been needed for prolapse ( slippage ) in 12.5 % , erosion of the band into the stomach in 2.8 % and for tubing breaks in 3.6 % .
Result	A steady progression of weight loss has occurred through the duration of the study with 52 + / - 19 % EWL at 24 months ( n = 333 ) , 53 + / - 22 % EWL at 36 months ( n = 264 ) , 52 + / - 24 % EWL at 48 months ( n = 108 ) , 54 + / - 24 % EWL at 60 months ( n = 30 ) , and 57 + / - 1
Result	Major improvements have occurred in diabetes , asthma , gastroesophageal reflux , dyslipidemia , sleep apnea and depression .
Result	Quality of life as measured by Rand SF-36 shows highly significant improvement .
Result	Placement of the Lap-Band system provides safe and effective control of severe obesity .
Result	The effect on weight loss is durable and is associated with major improvement in health and quality of life .
Result	It has the potential to provide a broadly acceptable option for this common and serious disease .

Background	The rare liquor leakage syndrome with cranial nerve lesion , which preferably affects the eye-muscle nerves , can be caused either by further leakage of liquor cerebrospinalis through the dura hole made by the lumbar puncture - or after a surgical operation
Background	This does not occur after a suboccipital puncture .
Method	A report is given on three cases with different eye-muscle paresis after a simple diagnostic lumbar puncture , after a lumbosacral myelography and after a resection of the sacral nerve roots including the filum terminale and caudal dural sac .
Result	The prognosis of the eye-muscle paresis is good .
Result	Restitutio ad integrum resulted .
Method	A fourth case with temporary loss of sight of one eye is reported after a lumbar air encephalography , but the eye nerves were damaged before as a result of previous tuberculous basal meningitis .
Result	Only partial recovery of the visual power occurred .

Method	The analgesic effect of intrathecal injection of epibatidine , clonidine and neostigmine , compounds that elevate ACh , was examined in the formalin test , a model of post-injury central sensitization in the rat .
Method	The compounds were injected alone and in combination .
Result	Intrathecal injection of epibatidine alone did not alter pain behaviors , compared to vehicle-treated rats .
Result	Intrathecal injection of clonidine dose-dependently reduced tonic pain behaviors ( ED ( 50 ) + / -95 % confidence limits = 6.7 + / -4.8 microg ) .
Result	The combination of clonidine and epibatidine ( C : E ) , in the ratio of 26:1 , dose-dependently reduced tonic pain behaviors ; and the ED ( 50 ) of C : E was 1.1 + / -0.98 microg a significant 6-fold leftward shift of the dose response curve , compared with clonidine al
Result	The antinociceptive effect of C : E ( 26:1 ) was attenuated by pre-treatment with the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine .
Result	Neostigmine dose-dependently reduced tonic pain behaviors ( ED ( 50 ) = 1.5 + / -1.3 microg ) .
Result	The combination of neostigmine and epibatidine , in a ratio of 8:1 , significantly shifted the dose response curve 4-fold to the left ( ED ( 50 ) = 0.4 + / -0.3 microg ) .
Result	The effect is mediated in part by the activation of the nAChR and possibly by the enhanced release of ACh .
Result	These data demonstrate significant enhancement of the antinociceptive effects of spinally delivered analgesics by a nAChR agonist , suggesting that this class of compounds may have utility as adjuvants when combined with conventional therapeutics .

Background	Serotonin basic neuroscience discoveries are evolving at a very fast pace and are leading to innovations in clinical psychiatry and in drug development .
Background	Numerous novel pharmacological tools , each selective for a given serotonin receptor subtype , are being applied to several psychiatric disorders .
Background	The strategy employed is theory driven and hypothesis oriented , aiming for new drug development that selectively targets receptors that are rational sites for therapeutic actions .
Background	Thus , serotonin uptake inhibitors are targeting not only depression , but also obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
Background	Serotonin1A agonists are targeting not only depression and anxiety , but also mixed anxiety depression .
Background	These and other agents selective for additional receptors are being tested in impulse control disorders ; eating disorders ; addictive disorders ; and aggressive , violent , self-destructive , and suicidal behaviors .
Background	Serotonin research is an excellent example of how basic science discoveries in the 1990 's `` Decade of the Brain '' are resulting in important advances in therapeutics for psychiatry .

Background	182 ( 1994 ) 290 ] .
Background	However , only a small percentage of these individuals access effective treatment .
Background	The undertreatment of anxiety and depression is a major public health issue and is associated with significant personal , social , and economic burden .
Background	This article describes the existing discrepancy between prevalence of anxiety and depression and access to effective treatment for adults and children , the contributors to this discrepancy , and suggests various means through which access to effective trea
Background	We begin with a brief overview of the prevalence and associated personal , societal , and systemic burdens of anxiety and depression .
Background	This is followed by a review of current rates of access to treatment and possible individual , provider , and systemic barriers to accessing treatment .
Background	Recommendations for bridging the gap between the high rates of these disorders and limited accessibility of effective care are then presented .

Background	Disabling tremor or ataxia is common in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and up to 80 % of patients experience tremor or ataxia at some point during their disease .
Background	A variety of treatments are available , ranging from pharmacotherapy or stereotactic neurosurgery to neurorehabilitation .
Method	To assess the efficacy and tolerability of both pharmacological and non-pharmacologic treatments of ataxia in patients with MS.
Method	The following electronic resources were searched
Method	Cochrane MS Group trials register ( June 2006 ) , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( Issue 2 , 2006 ) , National Health Service National Research Register ( NRR ) including the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Directory ( Issue 2 , 2006 ) , MEDLINE ( January 1996 to June 2006 ) , and EMBASE ( Jan 1988 to June 2006 ) .
Method	Manual searches of bibliographies of relevant articles , pertinent medical and neurology journals and abstract books of major neurology and MS conferences ( 2001-2006 ) were also performed .
Method	Direct communication with experts and drug companies was sought .
Method	Blinded , randomised trials which were either placebo-controlled or which compared two or more treatments were included .
Method	Trials testing pharmacological agents must have had both participant and assessor blinding .
Method	Trials testing surgical interventions or effects of physiotherapy , where participants could not have been blinded to the treatment , must have had independent assessors who were blinded to the treatment .
Method	Cross-over trials were included .
Method	Three independent reviewers extracted data and the findings of the trials were summarised .
Method	A meta-analysis was not performed due to the inadequacy of outcome measures and methodological problems with the studies reviewed .
Result	Ten randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria .
Result	Six placebo-controlled studies ( pharmacotherapy ) and four comparative studies ( one stereotactic neurosurgery and three neurorehabilitation ) were reviewed .
Result	No standardised outcome measures were used across the studies .
Result	In general , pharmacotherapies were unrewarding and data on neurosurgery or rehabilitation is insufficient to lead to a change in practice .
Result	The absolute and comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapies to treat ataxia in MS are poorly documented and no recommendations can be made to guide prescribing .
Result	Although studies on neurosurgery and neurorehabilitation showed promising results , the absolute indications for treating with those methods can not be developed .
Result	Standardised , well validated measures of ataxia and tremor need to be developed and employed in larger randomised controlled trials with careful blinding .

Background	Although the need for effective ovarian cancer screening is apparent , a highly sensitive and specific screening methodology has yet to be elucidated .
Background	42-44 Given that there are more than 43 million women in the United States older than 45 years of age and that the average cost of a pelvic sonogram is $ 275 ( and $ 45 for CA125 screening ) , the screening of this population is estimated to increase health
Background	45 The additional cost of BRCA1 screening varies according to the level of diagnostic effort required to establish BRCA1 gene mutations in a particular family and ranges from $ 295 to $ 1,200 per sample .
Background	Assuming an average cost of $ 600 per sample , initial screening of these same women would likely increased costs in excess of $ 25 billion .
Background	Current knowledge and technology in ovarian cancer screening has not yet proved beneficial for the general population or for women with fewer than two affected family members .
Background	For women with two or more affected family members , there is a 3 % chance of that patient being a proband in a hereditary cancer syndrome family .
Background	11,46 In this group , who may be at increased risk for developing a malignancy , heightened surveillance is warranted , although there are still no data to confirm that screening even these high-risk women will reduce mortality .
Background	Nevertheless , annual bimanual examination , serum CA125 , and transvaginal sonography are recommended among this particular subgroup of women at risk , and are likely to be recommended for young , asymptomatic , at-risk women who screen positive for the 185del
Background	It is only through prospective , randomized trials that reliable data regarding the risk/benefit ratio of ovarian cancer screening among various populations at risk will be determined .
Background	The results of the prospective/randomized PLCO trial and the mature data from ongoing prospective , nonrandomized screening trials for women with a family history of cancer may provide this information and are eagerly awaited .

Background	To examine the utility of quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) to characterize sensory dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .
Method	METHOD :
Method	Three QST trials were administered to six lower leg dermatomes , on two different days , to estimate the reliability of measurement .
Method	Regional Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Center in Ontario , Canada .
Method	Twenty-one SCI patients with incomplete neurologic deficits and 14 able-bodied controls of similar age .
Result	ANOVA revealed significantly ( p < .05 ) reduced perceptual threshold values ( hypoesthesia ) for warm , cold , and vibratory sensation in the SCI group .
Result	There were no differences between group mean values for cold pain because of the inclusion of patients with hypoalgesia and hyperalgesia .
Result	Intraclass correlation coefficient estimates of reliability revealed large between-subject variability in the SCI patients associated with relatively small trial-to-trial variability within each day of testing , and appreciable between-day variances .
Result	With QST in SCI there is a need for repeated measurements across days to establish stable baseline measures or outcomes following intervention .
Result	QST is a useful adjunct to clinical examination for assessment of preserved sensation .

Method	The effect of oral treatment with acyclovir ( ACV ) on sensory axonal neuropathy , segmental motor paresis and postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) was studied in 105 patients with herpes zoster .
Method	Forty-seven patients were treated with ACV at a dose of 4 g/day in 5 doses for at least a week ; the others did not undergo any kind of treatment .
Method	Electrodiagnostic examination of the nerves and muscles corresponding to the dermatomeric lesions was performed , including sensory and motor nerve conduction studies , blink reflex and electromyography ( EMG ) .
Result	The patients treated with ACV showed a significant reduction in the number of cases in which there was electrophysiological evidence of axonal damage in afferent fibres of nerves arising from roots corresponding to affected dermatomes .
Result	The treated group also showed a smaller incidence of segmental motor neuritis , clinically evident or only detectable by EMG as denervation .
Result	However , there was no significant difference between groups as far as the incidence of PHN was concerned .
Result	Oral treatment with ACV therefore reduces peripheral sensory axonopathy due to ganglion damage and prevents the possibility of spread to anterior roots and spinal motoneurones .
Result	In this way it reduces the incidence of segmental motor neuritis , but does not reduce the incidence of PHN .

Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence supporting the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) and severe respiratory failure .
Method	Medline , Embase , ISI Current Contents and Biosis databases were searched using a defined strategy .
Method	Case reports and opinion articles were excluded .
Method	We performed : 1 ) a systematic review of non randomised studies comparing mortality when ECMO was not available with a period when ECMO was available .
Method	Mortality was classified as `` early '' ( before hospital discharge ) and `` late '' ( after discharge ) .
Method	Patients were classified as `` ECMO '' and `` non-ECMO '' candidates according to criteria reported by the authors ; 2 ) a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing ECMO and conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV ) .
Method	Differences in mortality are reported as relative risk ( RR ) and 95 % confidence intervals .
Result	A ) SYSTEMATIC REVIEW : 658 studies and 21 ( 2043 patients ) fulfilled the entry criteria .
Result	Both early ( RR 0.60 [ 0.51-0 .70 ] ; p < 0.001 ) and late mortality ( RR 0.63 [ 0.53-0 .73 ] ; p < 0.001 ) were significantly lower when ECMO was available than when ECMO was unavailable .
Result	This difference in mortality was observed in `` ECMO candidates '' ( RR 0.46 [ 0.32-0 .68 ] ; p < 0.001 ) but not in `` non-ECMO candidates '' ( RR 0.80 [ 0.58-1 .10 ] ; p = 0.17 ) .
Result	B ) META-ANALYSIS : 3 trials comparing ECMO and conventional ventilation were identified which included 39 infants with CDH .
Result	The early mortality was significantly lower with ECMO compared to CMV ( RR 0.73 [ 95 % CI 0.55-0 .99 ] ; p < 0.04 ) , however , late mortality was similar in the two groups ( RR 0.83 [ 0.66-1 .05 ] ; p = 0.12 ) .
Result	Non randomised studies suggest a reduction in mortality with ECMO .
Result	However , differences in the indications for ECMO and improvements in other treatment modalities may contribute to this reduction .
Result	The meta-analysis of RCTs indicates a reduction in early mortality with ECMO but no long-term benefit .
Result	A large RCT in infants with CDH and severe respiratory failure is warranted .

Method	In a randomized prospective clinical trial in 128 patients undergoing radical surgical resection of primary colorectal cancer , 63 patients received intravenous fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) in two courses , four and eight weeks after surgery ; 65 controls received no
Result	The duration of follow-up exceeded five years in all cases , and 28 patients have died in each group .
Result	Recurrent disease was present in 26 5-FU patients ( 41.2 percent ) and in 22 controls ( 33.9 percent ) .
Result	There is no evidence that short-term 5-FU therapy was of significant value in the chemoprophylaxis of colorectal cancer .

Background	In this study , we examined the psychometric quality of the recently revised DSM-IV Personality Disorders ( PD ) .
Method	A nationally drawn sample of mental health professionals rated 280 patients known to them , using a symptom checklist containing all the DSM-IV PD criteria .
Result	From this symptom level data we determined internal consistency , convergent validity , and discriminant validity for each DSM-IV PD criteria .
Result	Overall , the findings were encouraging .
Result	The internal consistency -- a measure of reliability -- of the PD criteria sets appears to be substantially improved .
Result	The median coefficient alpha for the DSM-IV PDs was .73 .
Result	Convergent validity was generally adequate for the DSM-IV PD criteria sets .
Result	However , discriminant validity , a measure of the specificity of a criterion 's relationship to its parent scale , continues to be a problem of the PDs .
Result	The findings suggest that the DSM-IV PDs may have better reliability than did their DSM-III-R predecessors .
Result	However , the weak discriminant validity found for the DSM-IV PD criteria sets indicates that the Axis II system will continue to show high levels of comorbidity .
Result	The usefulness of psychometric procedures in the development and refinement of the DSM PDs is also highlighted .

Background	Chemoresistance may involve the anti-apoptotic transcriptional regulator , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Method	The purpose of this study was to determine whether chemotherapy induces NF-kappa B activation in a human colon cancer cell line ( SW48 ) and whether NF-kappa B is constitutively activated in colorectal cancer .
Method	SW48 cells were incubated with gemcitabine hydrochloride ( Gemzar ) in the presence and absence of the 26s proteasome inhibitor , MG132 , and NF-kappa B binding ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) , DNA synthesis ( tritiated thymidine uptake ) , cell viability
Method	NF-kappa B binding ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) was also assayed in 10 colorectal cancer tumors .
Result	SW48 cells demonstrated constitutive NF-kappa B binding that was enhanced by gemcitabine hydrochloride in a dose-dependent manner .
Result	MG132 inhibited NF-kappa B binding and enhanced gemcitabine hydrochloride 's inhibition of DNA synthesis ( gemcitabine hydrochloride = 73 % + / - 1.4 % vs gemcitabine hydrochloride + MG132 = 6 % + / - 0.4 % , P < .05 ) , cell killing ( gemcitabine hydrochloride = 87 %
Result	NF-kappa B binding was increased in 8 of 10 colorectal cancer tumors compared with adjacent normal mucosa .
Result	Gemcitabine hydrochloride enhances NF-kappa B binding in a colorectal cancer cell line , whereas inhibition of NF-kappa B enhances gemcitabine hydrochloride 's antitumor activity .
Result	NF-kappa B is also activated in human colorectal cancer .
Result	NF-kappa B may identify chemoresistant tumors , whereas inhibition of NF-kappa B may be a novel , biologically based therapy .

Background	Tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as imipramine and desipramine have long been known to produce cardiovascular side effects including sinus tachycardia , prolongation of the P-R , QRS , and Q-T intervals , and decreased T-wave amplitude .
Background	Life-threatening ventricular ectopic activity has occurred after tricyclic drug overdose .
Background	Recently , maprotiline ( Ludiomil ) , a tetracyclic anthracene-derivative antidepressant , has become available for the treatment of affective disorders .
Background	It appears as effective as the tricyclic drugs in relieving unipolar depression .
Background	Although several studies have reported a low incidence of cardiovascular side effects , others show little difference between the tetracyclic and tricyclic drugs .
Result	This report describes a patient in whom maprotiline treatment caused Q-T prolongation and life-threatening torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) .

Background	Injury to the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) initiates a response controlled by multiple extracellular mediators , many of which contribute to the development of neuropathic pain .
Background	Schwann cells in an injured nerve demonstrate increased expression of LDL receptor-related protein-1 ( LRP1 ) , an endocytic receptor for diverse ligands and a cell survival factor .
Method	Here we report that a fragment of LRP1 , in which a soluble or shed form of LRP1 with an intact alpha-chain ( sLRP-alpha ) , was shed by Schwann cells in vitro and in the PNS after injury .
Result	Injection of purified sLRP-alpha into mouse sciatic nerves prior to chronic constriction injury ( CCI ) inhibited p38 MAPK activation ( P-p38 ) and decreased expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta locally .
Result	sLRP-alpha also inhibited CCI-induced spontaneous neuropathic pain and decreased inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal dorsal horn , where neuropathic pain processing occurs .
Result	In cultures of Schwann cells , astrocytes , and microglia , sLRP-alpha inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of p38 MAPK and ERK/MAPK .
Result	The activity of sLRP-alpha did not involve TNF-alpha binding , but rather glial cell preconditioning , so that the subsequent response to TNF-alpha was inhibited .
Result	Our results show that sLRP-alpha is biologically active and may attenuate neuropathic pain .
Result	In the PNS , the function of LRP1 may reflect the integrated activities of the membrane-anchored and shed forms of LRP1 .

Background	Aseptic techniques used together with chlorhexidine reduced the infection rate and prevented cross-infection in patients undergoing urinary-tract catheterisation .
Background	Infection of the bladder appears to have arisen by contamination of the catheter-meatal junction , at which site antiseptic prophylaxis in the presence of bathing was ineffective .
Result	Patients having short-term catheterisation should not be placed in baths , since wetting the perineum will contaminate the urethral meatus with mixed enterobacteria , predisposing the female patient in particular to infection .

Background	A 68-year-old woman with a fragility fracture of the fourth lumbar vertebra was treated with a first vertebroplasty using methylmetacrylate with an initial good pain relief .
Result	Early painful recurrent vertebral fractures led to iterative vertebroplasties .
Result	Furthermore prophylactic treatment with methylmetacrylate of a non-fractured vertebra located between two previously injected ones did not prevent its collapse .
Result	This case report underlines the lack of a clear evaluation benefit/risk ratio of these procedures in patients with non-malignant bone fragility .

Background	Motor complications are a common cause of treatment failure in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
Method	Although the underlying mechanisms remain obscure , research with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 ,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) - treated primates may facilitate their investigation .
Method	Repeated administration of L-dopa to MPTP-treated primates results in a loss of drug efficacy ( `` wearing off '' ) and periods of immobility ( `` on-off '' ) .
Result	Immediately after each dose of L-dopa , animals show an initial worsening of motor performance ( `` beginning-of-dose deterioration '' ) and , at the end of action of each dose , they exhibit a decline to levels of disability below those seen at baseline
Result	Dyskinesia ( chorea , dystonia , athetosis ) appears rapidly in MPTP-treated primates given L-dopa .
Result	The greater the degree of nigral denervation , the less exposure to L-dopa that is required to induce dyskinesia .
Result	The onset and intensity of dyskinesia are related to the dose and frequency of L-dopa administration .
Result	Increasing brain exposure to L-dopa increases the severity and intensity of involuntary movements .
Result	In contrast , long-acting dopamine agonists ( DAs ) induce a far lower incidence of dyskinesia , and continuous dopaminergic stimulation may provide a means of avoiding its onset .
Result	Recent data from MPTP-treated primates suggest that switching from L-dopa to a long-acting DA may reverse the priming process associated with induction of dyskinesia .
Result	Responses of MPTP-treated primates have proved to be highly predictive of antiparkinsonian activities of drugs in humans and their ability to induce dyskinesia , but they may also have utility in evaluating the mechanisms that underlie a range of long-term

Background	To document the absenteeism costs associated with obesity and morbid obesity by occupation .
Method	Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2000-2004 are examined .
Method	The outcomes are probability of missing any work in the previous year and number of days of work missed in the previous year .
Method	Predictors include clinical weight classification , age , education , and race .
Method	Models are estimated separately by gender and occupation category .
Result	The probability of missing work in the past year , number of days missed , and costs of absenteeism rise with clinical weight classification for both women and men , and vary across occupation .
Result	Absenteeism costs associated with obesity total $ 4.3 billion annually in the United States .
Result	Substantial absenteeism costs are associated with obesity and morbid obesity .
Result	Employers should explore workplace interventions and health insurance expansions to reduce these costs .

Background	In patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , the addition of coenzyme Q10 to conventional therapy reduces the hospitalization rate for worsening of heart failure and the incidence of serious cardiovascular complications .
Background	The present study was planned to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon .
Background	Cardiac hemodynamics was evaluated continuously using an ambulatory radionuclide detector ( VEST ) which allows a noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular function .
Method	Six patients wit CHF ( mean ejection fraction ( EF ) : 29 % ) clinically documented were studied .
Method	This study was organized as a randomized double-blind , placebo controlled , cross-over trial .
Method	The enrolled patients , after a washout period , underwent the first hemodynamic evaluation with VEST .
Method	Subsequently they were randomized to receive placebo or coenzyme Q10 for 4 weeks .
Method	At the end of this period they underwent the second VEST study .
Method	The third VEST study was performed after a further 4-week period with inverted treatment .
Method	Cardiac hemodynamics were evaluated during bicycle exercise .
Result	The EF in control conditions ( CC ) changed from 27 + / - 11 % , at rest , to 24 + / - 8 % , at peak exercise .
Result	During coenzyme Q10 treatment EF showed a significant increase both at rest ( 33 + / - 13 % , P < 0.05 vs CC ) and at peak exercise ( 30 + / - 12 % , P < 0.05 vs CC ) .
Result	The same trends were recorded for the stroke volume and the cardiac output .
Result	Our results demonstrate that coenzyme Q10 improves cardiac hemodynamic response to exercise in patients with CHF and suggest that noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular function allows a more reliable assessment of therapy efficacy .

Background	The authors examine health and population aspects of development policies needed in Sub-Saharan Africa and their potential costs .
Background	The focus is on the demand for family planning and how to develop effective programs to meet it .
Background	Both the benefits and costs of such programs are considered .

Background	To compare the t-scores of proximal femur and lumbar spine of patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) with different levels of weight bearing .
Method	Cross-sectional study comparing 3 groups of patients with SCI : patients with daily standing times of more than 1 hour , patients with daily standing times of less than 1 hour , and nonstanding patients .
Method	Seventy-one patients with chronic SCI were recruited .
Method	They were assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to their reported daily standing time .
Method	The bone density of lumbar and proximal femoral regions was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry .
Result	The 3 groups were similar in terms of demographics and clinical variables .
Result	No significant difference was found among the mean t-scores of lumbar and proximal femoral regions of the groups .
Result	However , the patients in the group that stood more than 1 hour daily had a slight tendency to have higher t-scores than those in the control group .
Result	There was no significant difference among the 3 groups .
Result	However , standing might be partially helpful in protecting the bone density in SCI by opposing the effects of immobilization .

Background	The aims of the present study were to investigate whether temporal summation of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex depends on the stimulation site on the sole of the human foot , and to characterize the reflex receptive fields ( RRF ) of lower limb muscles to
Method	The cutaneous RRFs were assessed in 15 subjects in sitting position by recording the EMG from five lower leg muscles and the kinematic responses ( ankle , knee , and hip joints ) to repetitive painful electrical stimulation .
Method	The stimulus consisted of a series of five stimuli ( frequency : 3 Hz ) delivered randomly at 10 different sites on the sole of the foot .
Result	The size of the reflexes increased generally between the first and the second stimulus , however , the increment depended on the stimulation site .
Result	In tibialis anterior , the RRF covered the distal sole of the foot and gradually expanded during the stimulus train .
Result	No expansion toward the heel area was detected .
Result	In soleus , the reflexes were facilitated after the second stimulus at all sites and remained in this state until the last stimulus .
Result	In vastus lateralis , biceps femoris , and iliopsoas a gradual expansion of the RRF was seen , resulting in RRFs covering the lateral , distal foot , and part of the proximal foot ( iliopsoas ) .
Result	Knee and hip flexion were evoked at all sites .
Result	Ankle dorsiflexion was evoked at the distal foot , while ankle plantarflexion was evoked at the heel .
Result	The enlargement of the RRF reflects spinal temporal summation leading to gradually stronger reflex responses .
Result	The degree of temporal summation was dependent on stimulation site .
Result	The facilitation of the withdrawal reflex responses due to repetitive stimulation might have potential applications in the rehabilitation engineering field , where these reflexes could be used to assist gait of patients with central nervous system injuries

Background	This study tested the hypothesis that female subjects may exhibit a higher prevalence than male subjects of depression associated with somatic symptoms but not a higher prevalence of depression not associated with these other symptoms .
Method	The author reanalyzed research interview data on major depression from the National Comorbidity Survey , dividing respondents into those who met overall criteria for major depression and exhibited fatigue and appetite and sleep disturbance ( `` somatic d
Result	Female subjects exhibited a higher prevalence than male subjects of somatic depression but not a higher prevalence of pure depression .
Result	Somatic depression was associated with a high prevalence of anxiety disorder and , among female subjects , with body aches and onset of depression during early adolescence .
Result	The gender difference in depression may result from a difference in a specific subtype of anxious somatic depression .

Background	This study assessed the validity of standardized assessment data collected with the Minimum Data Set ( MDS ) in postacute care settings and used to create performance indicators .
Result	Our results show that performance indicators derived from information collected with the MDS demonstrate convergent validity with data collected with other research or standardized assessment instruments .
Method	Results were most favorable for areas of physical functioning , cognitive and communicative functioning , and clinical complexity .
Result	Results were encouraging for affective functioning , but further research and development in this area is clearly needed .
Result	There is a pressing need for better quality data on performance measurement in the postacute environment , given the rapid growth in the volume of services and expenditures for such care and the associated need to ensure that patients receive the most appr

Method	Randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) .
Method	To compare the effectiveness of training and equipment to reduce musculoskeletal injuries , increase comfort , and reduce physical demands on staff performing patient lifts and transfers at a large acute care hospital .
Background	Back injury to nursing staff during patient handling tasks is a major issue in health care .
Background	The value of mechanical assistive devices in reducing injuries to these workers is unclear .
Method	This three-armed RCT consisted of a `` control arm , '' a `` safe lifting '' arm , and a `` no strenuous lifting '' arm .
Method	A medical , surgical , and rehabilitation ward were each randomly assigned to each arm .
Method	Both intervention arms received intensive training in back care , patient assessment , and handling techniques .
Method	Hence , the `` safe lifting '' arm used improved patient handling techniques using manual equipment , whereas the `` no strenuous lifting '' arm aimed to eliminate manual patient handling through use of additional mechanical and other assistive equipment .
Result	Frequency of manual patient handling tasks was significantly decreased on the `` no strenuous lifting '' arm .
Result	Self-perceived work fatigue , back and shoulder pain , safety , and frequency and intensity of physical discomfort associated with patient handling tasks were improved on both intervention arms , but staff on the mechanical equipment arm showed greater improv
Result	Musculoskeletal injury rates were not significantly altered .
Result	The `` no strenuous lifting '' program , which combined training with assured availability of mechanical and other assistive patient handling equipment , most effectively improved comfort with patient handling , decreased staff fatigue , and decreased p
Result	The fact that injury rates were not statistically significantly reduced may reflect the less sensitive nature of this indicator compared with the subjective indicators .

Method	Middle-aged and elderly women with no specific disabilities in their daily life were divided into two groups : those visiting clinics with mild physical symptoms and those not visiting clinics .
Result	Those visiting clinics showed significantly lower mental and physical health indices , but satisfaction and emotional support were similar .
Result	Although those visiting clinics had significantly more stressful events , no differences were seen in ways they were dealt with .
Result	For those not visiting clinics , mental and physical health indices were better in their 60s than in their 50s and got worse again in their 70s , while for those visiting clinics indices were consistently low .
Result	Somatic symptoms in the women visiting clinics could be somatic reactions to their life situation from their 50s to their 60s .

Background	Blunt abdominal trauma with intra-abdominal bleeding is often underdiagnosed or even overlooked at trauma scenes .
Background	The purpose of this prospective , multicentre study was to compare the accuracy of physical examination and prehospital focused abdominal sonography for trauma ( PFAST ) to detect abdominal bleeding .
Method	Six rescue centres took part in the study from December 2002 to December 2003 , including 230 patients with suspected abdominal injury .
Method	The accuracy of physical examination at the scene and PFAST were compared .
Method	Later examinations in the emergency department ( ultrasonography and/or computed tomography ) were used as the reference standard .
Method	The complete protocol and follow-up was obtained in 202 patients .
Result	The sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of PFAST were 93 per cent , 99 per cent and 99 per cent , respectively , compared with 93 per cent , 52 per cent and 57 per cent for physical examination at the scene .
Result	Scanning with PFAST occurred a mean ( s.d. ) 35 ( 13 ) min earlier than ultrasound in the emergency department .
Result	Abdominal bleeding was detected in 14 per cent of patients .
Result	Using PFAST led to a change in either prehospital therapy or management in 30 per cent of patients , and a change to admitting hospital in 22 per cent .
Result	In this study , PFAST was a useful and reliable diagnostic tool when used as part of surgical triage at the trauma scene .

Method	This paper is a presentation of a study protocol to establish the prevalence of orthopaedic problems ( hip dislocation , pelvic obliquity , spinal deformity and contractures ) and their impact on pain , function , participation and health in a population of children and young people with severe cerebral palsy .
Background	Cerebral palsy is the commonest cause of motor impairment in childhood and is associated with life-long disability .
Background	An estimated 30 % of people with cerebral palsy have severe forms and are non-ambulant .
Background	Although the underlying neurological damage is not amenable to correction , many health services are dedicated to providing therapeutic and adaptive support to help people with the condition reach their potential .
Method	A cross-sectional survey of children and young people , aged 4-25 years with severe , non-ambulant cerebral palsy as defined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System ( Levels IV and V ) .
Method	Study participants will be identified from a pre-existing , geographically defined case register and recruited via a healthcare professional known to them .
Method	Two assessments will be undertaken : one involving parents/carers at home and using questionnaires ; the other involving the child/young person ideally in one of three settings and including X-rays if clinically indicated .
Result	This study will contribute to our knowledge of the history and epidemiology of orthopaedic problems in children and young people with cerebral palsy and how these problems accumulate and impact on participation , health and well-being .
Result	The study will also identify unmet need and make recommendations for good practice in relation to the orthopaedic care and management for people with severe cerebral palsy .

Background	A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting , but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting .
Background	The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess ; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear .
Background	In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering , it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies .
Background	Also , the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals ; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a ` one size fits all ' kind of explanatio
Background	Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a ` trial and error ' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander .
Background	While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects , in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment .
Method	This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs .
Method	To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia .
Method	The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research .
Method	The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 11 May 2006 using the terms exit * or wander * or elopement or ambulat * or walk * .
Method	This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly .
Method	Randomised clinical trials comparing intervention with no intervention or usual treatment ( ` standard care ' ) or another intervention .
Method	No suitable trials of non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention and management of wandering in the domestic setting were found .
Result	As no randomised controlled trials were found , no results can be reported .
Result	There is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting .

Background	Transurethral bladder tumor resection is associated with imperfect clinical staging and incomplete tumor removal .
Background	Transurethral prostate resection may be complicated by inadvertent damage to the urinary sphincter , bladder neck and trigone .
Background	We performed a multicenter pilot and feasibility study of a novel working element for resectoscopes designed to improve the efficacy and safety of transurethral endoscopic surgery .
Method	An innovative working element for resectoscopes was developed to convert the standard in/out linear/axial movement at the handgrip into a side-to-side , bidirectional , lateral rotating motion .
Method	The device is compatible with current optical technology and conventional electrocautery generators , and it has been granted marketing approval .
Method	It consists of variably sized cutting loops designed for transurethral resection of bladder tumors and the prostate .
Method	To date 80 patients with bladder cancer ( 38 ) or benign prostatic hyperplasia ( 42 ) have undergone surgery with this instrument at our 3 clinical sites .
Result	No safety concerns were evident .
Result	When used during transurethral bladder tumor resection , lateral resection at the base of the tumor enabled accurate depth of penetration into the bladder wall , which may decrease the risk of bladder perforation and improve pathological assessment of tumor
Result	During transurethral prostate resection this novel tool facilitated dissection of adenoma adjacent to the verumontanum and prostatovesical junction , which may decrease the risk of sphincteric damage and bladder neck injury .
Result	A novel resectoscope is currently under prospective clinical investigation to establish its surgical and pathological efficacy , ease of use and side effect profile .
Result	Current data suggest that the learning curve is mild , its use is safe and it provides distinct advantages when used for transurethral resection of bladder tumors and the prostate .

Method	Experiences gained in 5 patients subjected to endobronchial intubation with a double-lumen tube on account of several causes are reported .
Method	The mean length of application was 45.3 ( 6.5-67 .5 h ) , and depending on the underlying diagnosis , several techniques of controlled ventilation or spontaneous breathing were used .
Method	In all cases arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure were continuously monitored throughout the duration of the treatment , and in some cases the airway pressures were measured .
Method	Frequent blood gas analyses were carried out and x-rays of the chest regularly taken .
Method	In one case the haemodynamic patterns were studied via a Swan-Ganz catheter .
Result	In all cases an improvement of the predominantly unilateral pathology of the lungs was observed under independent ventilation or spontaneous breathing , as assessed by blood gas analysis and of x-ray examination .
Result	Irrespective of synchronization , the simultaneous application of 2 ventilators for the controlled ventilation of the patient had clinically no relevant effects on haemodynamics .
Result	In cases of unilateral pulmonary complications we therefore see at present the following indications for using a double lumen endobronchial tube : 1 .
Result	pulmonary contusions with endobronchial bleeding .
Result	We believe that double lumen endobronchial plastic tubes with hi-lo cuffs are , when properly applied , an advance in long term intubation and mechanical ventilation managements .

Background	Diabetes mellitus affects 21 million Americans ; an additional 41 million individuals in this country have impaired glucose tolerance .
Background	These individuals are at high risk for developing not only diabetes , but eventually dying from the cardiovascular complications associated with chronic exposure to hyperglycemia .
Background	Not only do patients with diabetes carry a 1.5 - to 4.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality , any microvascular complications they develop such as retinopathy , neuropathy , and nephropathy can have a profoundly negative effect on their quality of
Background	Even mild hyperglycemia is associated with macrovascular disease .
Background	Similarly , hyperglycemia that occurs concurrently during an acute myocardial infarction or stroke is associated with worse outcomes .
Background	Therefore , evidence suggests that both chronic and acute hyperglycemia lead to higher morbidity and mortality .
Method	As people age , their 2-hour postchallenge blood glucose level typically increases , often independent of their fasting glucose level .
Method	At diagnosis , 25 % of patients with type 2 diabetes have normal fasting glucose levels .
Method	The incidence of isolated impaired glucose tolerance is approximately 3 times greater than isolated impaired fasting glucose .
Method	Therefore , most patients with asymptomatic diabetes have isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia .
Background	A growing body of literature supports targeting postprandial hyperglycemia to lower glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) levels and reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with chronic hyperglycemia .
Background	This article will evaluate a typical patient case and strategies employed by the patient and health care provider .

Background	Neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) can be difficult to manage using currently available pain management techniques .
Background	We describe a case of chronic pain following SCI which failed to respond to a variety of approaches including intrathecal administration of morphine .
Result	Use of clonidine in addition to the morphine resulted in a marked decrease in pain .
Result	The use of intrathecal clonidine with or without opioids may present an effective alternative in the management of intractable SCI pain and other forms of neuropathic pain .

Background	Cervical dystonia is the most common form of focal dystonia .
Background	It is characterized by involuntary posturing of the head and frequently is associated with neck pain .
Background	Disability and social withdrawal are common .
Background	Most cases are idiopathic , and generally it is a life-long disorder .
Background	In recent years , botulinum toxin type A ( BtA ) has become first line therapy for cervical dystonia .
Background	However , not all patients respond well to BtA , and 5 to 10 % become resistant to it .
Background	Botulinum toxin B ( BtB ) is an alternative to BtA and offers the potential to help patients who do not respond to BtA .
Background	At present there is no compelling theoretical reason why it should not be as effective as , or even more effective than , BtA .
Method	To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia .
Method	Studies for inclusion in the review were identified using the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group trials register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , by handsearching the Movement Disorders Journal and abstracts of international congresses on movement disorders and botulinum toxin , by communication with other researchers in the field , by searching reference lists of papers found using the above search strategies , and by contact with authors and drug manufacturer .
Method	Studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the review if they evaluated the efficacy of BtA versus BtB for the treatment of cervical dystonia .
Method	Trials must have been randomised and placebo-controlled .
Method	A paper pro-forma was used to collect data from the included studies using double extraction by two independent reviewers .
Method	Each trial was assessed for internal validity by each of the two reviewers .
Method	Differences were settled by discussion .
Method	The outcome measures used included improvement in symptomatic rating scales , subjective evaluation by patients and clinicians , changes in pain scores , changes in quality of life assessments , and frequency and severity of adverse events .
Result	We can not give any results since we have only identified two ongoing trials and there are no preliminary results or interim analyses available for them .
Result	The full results of these trials are expected in late 2004 or 2005 .
Result	It is currently not possible to make definitive comparisons between BtA and BtB for the treatment of cervical dystonia ; uncontrolled comparisons should be regarded with suspicion .

Background	Surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs , but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited .
Background	Degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease ( which we regarded as one entity ) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms , instability , spinal stenosis
Method	The objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis .
Method	We searched CENTRAL , MEDLINE , PubMed , Spine and ISSLS abstracts , with citation tracking from the retrieved articles .
Method	We also corresponded with experts .
Method	All data found up to 31 March 2005 are included .
Method	Randomised ( RCTs ) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis .
Method	Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers .
Method	Additional information was sought from the authors if necessary .
Result	Thirty-one published RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified .
Result	The trials varied in quality : only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization , blinding and independent assessment of outcome .
Result	Most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome .
Result	More of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability , but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes .
Result	There was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years .
Result	Seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis , spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions .
Result	Two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results .
Result	One showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy , while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme .
Result	Eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate ( though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work ) , but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal , while there
Result	Three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior , posterior or circumferential fusion .
Result	Preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results .
Result	Preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions .
Result	Limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice .
Result	Surgeons should be encouraged to perform further RCTs in this field .

Background	Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) have significant end-of-life needs , but are much less likely than patients with cancer to access or receive appropriate palliative care .
Method	Little is known about the existing availability or quality of available services within the United Kingdom .
Background	We surveyed 100 NHS acute hospitals enquiring into the provision of care for patients with COPD and requesting examples of current good practice that might be used to set standards .
Result	Forty-two percent of hospitals had formal palliative care arrangements for patients with COPD , whereas 59 % had plans to develop or further develop services .
Result	Analysis of qualitative data suggested four strands that highlighted good practice ; teams , care pathways , service components and linkages .
Result	These data may help to inform the debate leading to the development of standards in end-of-life care for patients with COPD .

Background	We observed an increase in cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) for control of pain but were otherwise normal .
Method	Based on that observation , we implanted stimulators for cervical spinal cord stimulation ( cSCS ) in three patients who had symptomatic cerebral ischemia .
Method	Two had severe basivertebral occlusive disease and one had bilateral carotid occlusive disease .
Result	In all three cases , cSCS alleviated the symptoms of ischemia .
Result	Xenon-CBF studies or single-photon emission computer tomography ( SPECT ) showed increased CBF in response to cSCS .
Result	Although no mechanism clearly responsible for this remarkable therapeutic efficacy can be proposed yet , further clinical trials of cSCS for inoperable cerebral ischemia may be justified .

Background	This study aimed to assess the effect of a hospital-based smoking cessation intervention delivered by midwives during routine antenatal and postnatal care on the smoking habits of pregnant women and their partners .
Method	At the first antenatal visit , women in the intervention group ( n = 110 ) were given a demonstration of the immediate effects of smoking on foetal heart rate , brief smoking cessation advice and smoking cessation booklets for themselves and their partners ; a
Result	Compared with an historical control group who received usual care ( n = 110 ) and assuming those lost to follow-up continued to smoke , biochemically-verified maternal cessation sustained from at least 24 weeks gestation to late pregnancy was 6.4 % in the int
Result	However , there was no difference between maternal quit rates at six months postpartum .
Result	Partners were more likely to try to quit in the intervention group , but quit rates did not differ .
Result	Exposure to the intervention was not associated with increased levels of psychological distress , as measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire .
Result	We conclude that this type of intervention , when implemented by staff during routine care , is probably associated with a small improvement in maternal cessation in pregnancy , similar to that produced by minimal advice to quit smoking .

Background	This paper discusses topics related to the planning and implementation of non-randomised clinical studies in orthopaedics .
Background	A well-conducted case-series is appropriate to demonstrate the safety of a surgical intervention .
Background	The case-series design involves the provision of a defined intervention to a group of patients with the ultimate objective of describing the final outcome , including such occurrences as complications .
Background	There is no alternative procedure serving as a control .
Background	The key aspects are to ensure enrolment of all eligible patients and to obtain a sufficiently large sample size to allow precise and valid estimation of complication risks .
Background	Targeted complications should be clearly defined and fully documented during a pre-defined follow-up period .
Background	Loss to follow-up should be minimised .
Background	Comparative studies are required to demonstrate treatment effectiveness .
Background	If a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) is not feasible , an observational design such as a cohort or a case-control study should be considered .
Background	In observational designs , the treatment decision is made by the surgeons .
Background	In a case-control study , patients are selected based on their outcomes and their treatment or exposure status is recorded retrospectively .
Background	In a cohort study , groups of patients are selected based on their treatment and are followed for outcomes .
Background	There are numerous variations .
Background	Data can be collected prospectively or retrospectively ; comparison groups may be concurrent or non-concurrent , or studied at different locations .
Background	The optimal design is tailored to clinical questions and research settings , while keeping in mind the respective methodological strengths and weaknesses of available options .
Background	The strength of the observational study is its proximity to daily clinical practice .
Background	The limitations are the possibility of numerous biases and confounding factors .
Background	Despite many challenges to the internal validity of non-randomised studies in orthopaedics surgery , it is possible to use such designs in order to provide reasonably valid answers to clinically important questions .

Background	Morbid obesity is increasingly recognized in children and adolescents .
Background	The National Institute of Health Consensus Conference has concluded that bariatric surgery is the only consistent effective method for achieving long-term weight loss .
Result	Advantages of the laparoscopic approach , which include decreased hospital stay and morbidity , have been demonstrated in randomized controlled studies .
Method	Herein , we describe our technique of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass .

Background	Some women who have threatened to give birth prematurely , subsequently settle .
Background	They may then take oral tocolytic maintenance therapy to prevent preterm birth and to prolong gestation .
Method	To assess the effects of oral betamimetic maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour for preventing preterm birth .
Method	We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register ( June 2005 ) and MEDLINE ( from 1966 to August 2003 ) .
Method	Randomised controlled trials comparing oral betamimetic with alternative tocolytic therapy , placebo or no therapy , for maintenance following treatment of threatened preterm labour .
Method	Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria and carried out data extraction and quality assessment of studies .
Method	Eleven randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) were included .
Result	No differences were seen for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit when betamimetics were compared with placebo ( relative risk ( RR ) 1.29 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.64 to 2.60 ; one RCT of terbutaline with 140 women ) or with magnesium ( RR 0.80 ,
Result	The rate of preterm birth ( less than 37 weeks ) showed no significant difference in four RCTs , two comparing ritodrine with placebo/no treatment and two comparing terbutaline with placebo/no treatment ( RR 1.08 , 95 % CI 0.88 to 1.32 , 384 women ) .
Result	No differences between betamimetics and placebo , no treatment or other tocolytics were seen for perinatal mortality and morbidity outcomes .
Result	Some adverse effects such as tachycardia were more frequent in the betamimetics groups than the groups allocated to placebo , no treatment or another type of tocolytic .
Result	Available evidence does not support the use of oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour .

Background	Previous studies on the treatment of rotator cuff tears in wheelchair-bound patients have concentrated on nonsurgical management .
Method	We conducted a retrospective review to determine the effectiveness of surgical repair of rotator cuff tears in spinal cord-injured patients .
Method	Five male patients with rotator cuff tears confirmed by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging underwent rotator cuff repair .
Method	Two of eight shoulders were revisions .
Result	The patients were evaluated postoperatively with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Scoring System .
Result	These results were compared with preoperative functional assessment .
Result	Patients were given a subjective questionnaire to assess their overall experience .
Result	Postoperative range of motion improved in 6 of 8 shoulders .
Result	Strength was increased in 6 of 8 shoulders .
Result	Patients reported satisfaction with the results in 7 of 8 shoulders , and all 5 patients would recommend the procedure to other spinal cord injury patients .
Result	At recent follow-up , 7 of 8 shoulders returned to their preinjury level of function .
Result	Surgery for spinal cord injury patients with rotator cuff tears can improve their functional capability and autonomy while reducing their pain .
Result	Compliance with the demanding postoperative rehabilitation is essential ; therefore proper patient selection is crucial for optimal results .

Background	Approximately 10 % of patients with cancer develop brain metastases .
Background	Although usually appearing late in the course of the disease , the brain metastasis may be present before the primary cancer has been identified and may present as a single lesion or as multiple lesions .
Background	The diagnostic and therapeutic approach depends on the number and location of brain lesions and the stage of the cancer .
Background	Patients with brain metastases are rarely cured .
Background	However , appropriate treatment can improve both the quality and duration of the patient 's life .
Background	Treatment must be directed not only at the brain metastasis ( definitive care ) , but also at a multitude of other symptoms that plague patients with cancer and brain metastases ( supportive care ) .
Result	Judicious selection of pharmacological agents can effectively treat many serious symptoms in patients with brain metastases , but injudicious selection of pharmacological agents , through side effects , may make the patients ' quality of life worse .
Result	This article reviews some aspects of both definitive and supportive care with particular attention to the side effects of some commonly used pharmacological agents .

Background	Conventional clinical neuroimaging is insensitive to axonal injury in traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
Background	Immunocytochemical staining reveals changes to axonal morphology within hours , suggesting potential for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) in early diagnosis and management of TBI .
Background	Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) characterizes the three-dimensional ( 3D ) distribution of water diffusion , which is highly anisotropic in white matter fibers owing to axonal length .
Background	Recently , DTI has been used to investigate traumatic axonal injury ( TAI ) , emphasizing regional analysis in more severe TBI .
Background	In the current study , we hypothesized that a global white matter ( WM ) analysis of DTI data would be sensitive to TAI across a spectrum of TBI severity and injury to scan interval .
Method	To investigate this , we compared WM-only histograms of a scalar , fractional anisotropy ( FA ) , between 20 heterogeneous TBI patients recruited from Detroit Medical Center , including six mild TBI ( GCS 13-15 ) , and 14 healthy age-matched controls .
Method	FA histogram parameters were correlated with admission GCS and posttraumatic amnesia ( PTA ) .
Result	In all cases , including mild TBI , patients ' FA histograms were globally decreased compared with control histograms .
Result	The shape of the TBI histograms also differed from controls , being more peaked and skewed .
Result	The mean FA , kurtosis and skewness were highly correlated suggesting a common mechanism .
Result	FA histogram properties also correlated with injury severity indexed by GCS and PTA , with mean FA being the best predictor and duration of PTA ( r = 0.64 ) being superior to GCS ( r = 0.47 ) .
Result	Therefore , in this heterogeneous sample , the FA mean accounted for 40 % of the variance in PTA .
Result	Increased diffusion in the short axis dimension , likely reflecting dysmyelination and swelling of axons , accounted for most of the FA decrease .
Result	FA is globally deceased in WM , including mild TBI , possibly reflecting widespread involvement .
Result	FA changes appear to be correlated with injury severity suggesting a role in early diagnosis and prognosis of TBI .

Background	Infection with Helicobacter pylori , particularly with strains positive for CagA protein , increases the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma .
Background	Few studies have explored the possible association between H. pylori infection and colorectal cancer .
Method	This study evaluated whether the seroprevalence of CagA in H. pylori-infected patients affected risk for colorectal cancer independently of H. pylori status .
Method	In this study , we tested serum IgG antibodies against H. pylori ( ELISA ) and CagA protein ( Western blot assay ) in 67 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma , 36 with gastric adenocarcinoma , 47 with other malignancies ( cancer controls ) , and 45 hospitalized
Method	Colonic cancer and gastric cancer patients with H. pylori infection were compared to each control group and to the pooled controls using simple and adjusted analyses .
Result	H. pylori infection was noted in 50 colon cancer patients , 31 gastric cancer patients , 31 cancer controls , and 32 TEE controls .
Result	In all , 41 ( 82 % ) , 29 ( 94 % ) , 11 ( 35 % ) , and 13 ( 41 % ) , respectively , of these H. pylori-positive sera expressed CagA reactivity ( p < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons between cases and controls ) .
Result	In the adjusted analysis , infection with H. pylori CagA + compared to H. pylori CagA - was associated with increased risk for colorectal adenocarcinoma ( odds ratio = 10.6 ; 95 % CI = 2.7-41 .3 ; p = 0.001 ) and gastric adenocarcinoma ( odds ratio = 88.1 ; 95 % CI =
Result	Among patients infected with H. pylori , CagA + seropositivity is associated with increased risk for both gastric and colonic cancer .
Result	This finding should stimulate additional research into the role of cagA + H. pylori infection in the development of colorectal cancer .

Method	The overall efficacy and tolerance of a new skeletal muscle relaxant DS 103-282 was evaluated by treating 10 patients with chronic spinal spasticity .
Background	Other agents such as baclofen , dantrolene sodium or diazepam had been only minimally beneficial in these patients .
Method	per day at the end of the 8-week trial period .
Result	Objective rating assessments showed improvement in spasticity , medullary automatism and clonus .
Result	No changes were recorded in the reflex pattern nor improvement in disability scores .
Result	Only a few mild side-effects were reported , there was a noticeable absence of sedation , but reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted in most patients .
Result	DS 103-282 appears to have demonstrable myotonolytic action and in view of its good tolerance it deserves further investigation .

Background	To determine the impact of hydrosalpinx on pregnancy rates in patients undergoing IVF for infertility caused by tubal disease .
Method	Review of the records of all patients who had undergone IVF for tubal factor infertility at our institution between May 1988 and October 1994 .
Method	A university-sponsored , hospital-based IVF facility .
Method	Two hundred fifty patients were identified with infertility due to tubal disease ; 67 of these had at least one documented hydrosalpinx whereas the remaining 183 did not .
Method	Numbers of oocytes retrieved and fertilized , the number of embryos transferred and implanting , and resulting pregnancy rates .
Result	The groups were similar in age and cycle cancellation rates .
Result	The patients with hydrosalpinx had greater numbers of oocytes retrieved per cycle ( 15.0 versus 11.6 ) and embryos transferred per cycle then those without hydrosalpinges ( 4.21 versus 3.98 ) .
Result	The hydrosalpinx group also undertook more cycles per patient ( 2.31 versus 1.96 ) .
Result	Fertilization rates between the two groups were similar , but implantation rates were decreased in those with hydrosalpinx ( 8.5 % versus 11.2 % ) .
Result	Hydrosalpinx did not result in impaired ovarian stimulation or decreased oocyte fertilization .
Result	It did , however , interfere with implantation and reduce to some degree the success of IVF in achieving an ongoing pregnancy .
Result	The validity of routine salpingectomy for hydrosalpinx is debatable , but its use in selected individuals may well be appropriate .

Background	To conduct a systematic review of the rehabilitation literature of moderate to severe acquired brain injuries ( ABI ) from traumatic and non-traumatic causes .
Method	A review of the literature was conducted for studies looking at interventions in ABI rehabilitation .
Method	The methodological quality of each study was determined using the Downs and Black scale for randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and non-RCTs as well as the Physiotherapy Evidence Database ( PEDro ) scale for RCTs only .
Result	Almost 14 000 references were screened from which 1312 abstracts were selected .
Result	A total of 303 articles were chosen for careful review of which 275 were found to be interventional studies but only 76 of these interventional studies were RCTs .
Result	From this , 5 levels of evidence were determined with 177 conclusions drawn ; however of the 177 conclusions only 7 were supported by two or more RCTs and 41 were supported by one RCT .
Result	Only 28 % of the interventional studies were RCTs .
Result	Over half of the 275 interventional studies were single group interventions , pointing to the need for studies of improved methodological quality into ABI rehabilitation .

Background	Multiple sclerosis is a presumed cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system .
Background	Cyclophosphamide ( CFX ) is a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agent , used in systemic autoimmune diseases .
Background	Controversial results have been reported on its efficacy in MS.
Method	We conducted a systematic review of all relevant trials , evaluating the CFX efficacy in patients with progressive MS.
Method	The main objectives were to determine whether CFX slows the disease progression .
Method	Electronic databases ( including MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Controlled Trials Register ) were systematically searched .
Method	References list of retrieved studies and conference abstracts on the main meetings on Multiple Sclerosis were handsearched .
Method	Randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the clinical effect of CFX treatment in patients affected by clinically definite progressive MS.
Method	CFX had to be administered alone or in combination with ACTH or steroids .
Method	The comparison group had to be placebo or no treatment or the same co intervention ( ACTH or steroids ) The main outcome criteria were progression of disability ( defined as an increase of 0.5 point in Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) for patients with baseline EDSS > or = 6 and 1 for EDSS < or = 5.5 ) , differences of disability between treatment-control groups and the number of patients with side effects .
Method	The identified references were reviewed by two reviewers who independently decided the eligibility of the study , extracted and summarized data and assessed the trial 's quality .
Method	The statistical analysis was performed using the Cochrane RevMan software and analyzed using Cochrane MetaView .
Result	Of the 326 identified references , 80 were selected for full review , only four RCTs were selected for the final analysis .
Result	Intensive immunosuppression with CFX ( alone or associated with ACTH or prednisone ) in patients with progressive MS compared to placebo or no-treatment ( 152 participants ) did not prevent the long - term ( 12-18-24 months ) risk to evolution to a next step of
Result	However , the mean change in disability ( final disability subtracted from the baseline ) significantly favoured the treated group at 12 ( effect size - 0.21 ; C. I. - 0.24 , - 0.17 ) and 18 months ( - 0.19 ; C. I. - 0.24 , - 0.14 ) .
Result	We were not able to verify the efficacy of other schedules .
Result	Five patients died ; sepsis and amenorrhea frequently occurred in treated patients ( descriptive analysis ) .
Result	Only limited objectives were reached .
Result	This review shows a role of CFX in the treatment of progressive MS , but less toxic schedules must be considered , before its use in the clinical practice .

Background	Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) initiates immediate and secondary neuropathological cascades that can result in persistent neurological dysfunction .
Background	Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that experimental rat brain injury causes a rapid and persistent decrease in CNS alpha7 * nicotinic cholinergic receptor ( nAChr ) expression .
Background	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether intermittent nicotine injections could improve cognitive performance in the Morris water maze ( MWM ) following experimental brain injury .
Method	Adult male rats were anesthetized and subjected to a 1.5 mm controlled cortical impact ( CCI ) injury of the somatosensory cortex .
Method	Animals received twice daily i.p. nicotine injections for 11 days prior to CCI , 11 days following CCI or during both pre - and post-surgical intervals .
Method	MWM training was initiated 12 days post-injury .
Result	In the training phase of cognitive testing , twice-daily nicotine treatment following injury attenuated trauma-induced deficits in the distance traveled to reach the escape platform .
Result	This group of animals also had improvements in several measures of the probe test , including time spent , distance traveled and total entries into the target quadrant .
Result	TBI caused significant deficits in alpha7 * nAChr expression in several regions of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex , which were largely unaffected by intermittent nicotine treatment .
Result	However , nicotine treatment up-regulated [ ( 3 ) H ] - epibatidine binding to non-alpha7 * nAChrs , attenuating TBI-induced deficits in receptor expression in several brain regions evaluated .
Result	These results suggest that nicotine is efficacious at attenuating CCI-induced cognitive deficits in a manner independent of changes in alpha7 * nAChr expression , perhaps via up-regulation of non-alpha7 * nAChrs .

Background	To test whether instrumental behavior of some children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is more variable than control subjects , the sequences of responses by three groups of children were compared : ( i ) those diagnosed with ADHD who liv
Method	The experiment consisted of rewarding children for responding in a computer ` game ' on two keys of a keyboard during each of three phases .
Method	In phase 1 , rewards were provided independently of sequence variability ( IND ) .
Method	In phase 2 , rewards depended upon highly variable sequences of left and right responses .
Method	Phase 3 was a return to the IND contingencies .
Result	The results showed that sequence variability was higher in the sequence variability ( VARY ) phase than in the preceding IND phase , but remained high when the contingencies returned to IND , thus replicating previous findings .
Result	In none of the phases did the ADHD children respond more variably than the controls .
Result	However , ADHD subjects made more off-task responses than did controls .
Result	Thus , although the present research showed differences between ADHD and control subjects , there was no evidence to support higher behavioral variability in the ADHD subjects .

Background	The Mahoney strain of poliovirus type 1 ( OM ) is generally unable to cause paralysis in mice .
Method	We isolated a mouse-adapted mutant , PV1/OM-SA ( SA ) , from the spinal cord of a mouse that had been intracerebrally inoculated with OM .
Result	SA showed mouse neurovirulence only with intraspinal inoculation , and the infected mice developed a flaccid paralysis , which was indistinguishable from that observed in poliovirus-sensitive transgenic mice inoculated with OM .
Result	SA antigens were detected in neurons of the spinal cords of the infected mice .
Result	Nucleotide ( nt ) sequence analysis revealed 9 nt changes on the SA genome , resulting in three amino acid ( a.a. ) substitutions , i.e. , one each in the capsid proteins VP4 and VP1 and in the noncapsid protein 2C .
Result	To identify the key mutation site ( s ) for the mouse neurovirulence , virus recombinants between OM and SA were constructed by using infectious cDNA clones of these two viruses and tested for their mouse neurovirulence after inoculation via an intraspinal ro
Result	The results indicated that a mutation at nt 928 ( replacement of A with G ) , resulting in a substitution of Met for Ile at a.a. 62 within VP4 , was responsible for conferring the mouse neurovirulence phenotype of the mutant SA .
Result	The mutation in VP4 may render the virus accessible to a molecule that acts as a virus receptor and is located on the surfaces of neurons of the mouse spinal cord .
Result	This molecule appears not to be expressed in the mouse brain .

Background	Substantial relief of discomfort may be anticipated by most patients suffering from pelvic and lower-extremity pain who are treated by arterial infusion of nitrogen mustard .
Method	Seventy-three patients with intractable pain secondary to malignancy arising in the pelvis received 83 percutaneous pelvic arterial infusions of this drug .
Result	Sixty infusions ( 72 % ) resulted in marked relief from pain for periods averaging 6-8 weeks .
Result	Advantages of the procedure are low toxicity , relative simplicity and availability of technique , and an acceptable rate of complications with minimal morbidity .
Result	Patients experiencing satisfactory results may expect significant relief from a second infusion for recurrent pain .
Result	The most rewarding result is the freedom from the cyclic return of pain characterized by oral and intramuscular analgesic therapy .
Result	Little or no relief can be expected in patients with pain caused by compression fractures of the vertebrae , or where the tumor burden is so great that adequate perfusion of the involved nerves is not possible .
Result	One should consider this procedure for controlling pain before resorting to the more dangerous and potentially disabling techniques of spinal cordotomy or intrathecal alcohol injection .

Method	This study was a retrospective data-base review of patients with cervical injuries admitted to a regional spinal cord injury center over a 9-year period .
Method	Patients < 40 and > or = 65 were analyzed separately to determine differences in etiology , neurologic findings , mortality , and neurologic recovery .
Background	Previous studies of cervical injuries in older patients have found a high percentage of falling as an etiology , a high incidence of injuries to C2 , and a high mortality rate with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .
Method	Three databases containing information on all SCI patients , SCI patients with 1-2 year follow-up , and neurogically intact spinal injury patients were reviewed retrospectively .
Result	A higher percentage of older patients had cervical injuries , and this group did not show the typical male predominance seen in young patients ( 4:1 vs. 1:1 ) .
Result	Neurologic deficits were more common in the younger age group .
Result	In the older patients , falls were a much more common etiology , and upper cervical injuries , especially odontoid fractures , predominated .
Result	Cervical spondylosis and stenosis were more common in the older patients , and the mortality with associated SCI was 60 times higher than in younger patients .
Result	Younger patients more commonly had complete neurologic injuries , but had more early functional motor return in incomplete lesions .
Result	The older patients did show late functional return in incomplete deficits .
Result	Cervical spine injury commonly occurs with relatively minor trauma in patients > or = 65 , with a mortality rate of approximately 26 % with associated SCI .
Result	Return of functional motor recovery is delayed in older patients with incomplete deficits , but can be expected .
Result	C2 injuries , especially odontoid fractures , must be ruled out in older patients with neck pain after even a minor injury .

Background	Stroke-related death is the third most common cause of mortality in Hungary after cardiovascular diseases and cancer .
Background	In addition to the unfavourable mortality figures , the consequent development of neurological and psychiatric disorders in stroke patients imposes an enormous burden on the health care system and on the families .
Background	Numerous studies are being conducted world wide on the prevention of stroke and other cerebrovascular disorders like chronic hypoperfusion , as well as on acute stroke management and patient rehabilitation issues .
Background	As a result , our understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic brain damage steadily increased over the past years and decades which brought along promising achievements both in the field of stroke prevention and therapy .
Background	However , these broad-spectrum approaches also made clear that preventing neuronal death and thus reducing neurological damage are complex tasks that can not be successfully resolved by targeting single mechanisms .
Method	Therefore , the development of alternative new drugs and clinically applicable complex neuroprotective strategies is warranted .
Background	One of the most promising approaches is to create ischemic tolerance in the brain by using pharmacological preconditioning paradigms .
Background	These drugs trigger similar events to those initiated by brief ischemic insults that later can make the cerebral tissue resistant to subsequent otherwise lethal stress ( ischemic preconditioning ) .

Background	Percutaneous vertebral body injection procedures currently are used to stabilize and reinforce weakened or fractured bone resulting from metastatic disease and severe osteoporosis .
Background	Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can reinforce the structure of a vertebral body and provide pain relief , but the procedures have technical differences .
Background	Kyphoplasty improves vertebral height to varying degrees in nearly three quarters of patients .
Background	Kyphosis is improved more effectively when the procedure is performed within 3 months from the onset of fracture pain .
Background	To date , it is unknown whether vertebroplasty with preprocedure postural reduction can provide similar improvement of deformity .
Result	Complications are relatively infrequent with both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty .
Result	Cement leakage from the vertebral body is more likely with vertebroplasty than with kyphoplasty .
Result	Leakage is more common in the treatment of pathologic fractures resulting from metastatic disease .
Result	Clinical complications caused by cement leakage and neural compression are infrequent .
Result	Specific indications for these injection procedures need to be more clearly refined .
Result	Long-term outcomes , including the fate of the injected material and the effect on adjacent vertebrae , have yet to be determined .

Background	This article explores the physiologic basis and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea -- a general term encompassing central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea .
Background	The former is relatively uncommon while the latter is much more common .
Background	Episodic collapse and blockage of the upper airway occur during sleep despite continuous respiratory effort .
Background	Three types of sleep obstructive breathing -- apnea , hypopnea , and airway resistance -- are associated with respiratory-related arousals from sleep .

Background	Transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) of the ovary is a rare , recently recognized , subtype of ovarian surface epithelial cancer .
Method	We present a case of TCC of the ovary , managed by staging operation and followed by postoperative chemotherapy with carboplatin and cyclophosphamide .
Method	A 67-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with a 2-year history of progressive enlargement of an abdominal mass .
Method	Pelvic sonography and abdominal computed tomography showed a pelvic mass measuring 210 x 165 x 203 mm .
Method	The serum CA-125 titer was also elevated ( 65.01 U/mL ) .
Method	A staging operation with total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , infracolic omentectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection was performed .
Method	After surgery , the pathologic report of the left ovarian tumor was TCC , grade 2-3 , stage IA .
Method	The patient then underwent four cycles of postoperative chemotherapy with carboplatin and cyclophosphamide .
Result	CA-125 levels declined to within the normal range after the first cycle of chemotherapy .
Result	TCC of the ovary is a rare subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer .
Result	It differs from malignant Brenner tumor by the absence of a benign or borderline Brenner component .
Result	Surgical resection is the primary therapeutic approach , and patient outcomes after chemotherapy are better than for other types of common epithelial ovarian cancers .

Method	The authors analyse results of the treatment of 120 patients with vertebrogenic radicular pain syndromes by reflexotherapy , electropuncture , electroacupuncture and acupuncture , applied both alone and combined under conditions of a neurological department .

Background	Unexplained infertility is a diagnosis made by exclusion after all of the standard investigations have revealed no abnormality ( 1 ) .
Background	The range of the prevalence is from 6 to 60 percent ( 23 ) , depending on the diagnostic criteria .
Background	This article reviews the literature in the management of unexplained infertility ; published data suggest no benefit of danazol or bromocriptine .
Result	The empirical use of clomiphene citrate suggests that ovarian stimulation using clomiphene citrate can double the spontaneous pregnancy rate ( 52 , 58 , 59 ) .
Result	Induction of ovulation with human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hMG ) yields an overall pregnancy rate between 2 and 26 percent per cycle ( 68 , 74 ) .
Result	These results seem to be lower than those reported for in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or gamete intrafallopian transfer ( GIFT ) procedures in similar patients ( 25-30 percent ( 92 , 95 ) ) .
Result	Based on the literature , a rational treatment plan for treating infertility in couples with unexplained infertility includes up to four cycles of clomiphene citrate with or without intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) .
Result	Superovulation with hMG and IUI or stimulated intrauterine insemination ( SIUI ) is the next step for three-cycle treatments and if unsuccessful , one of the variants of assisted reproductive techniques ( ART ) should be considered .

Background	To characterize the factors associated with the ` doctor ' effect in primary care , as reported in randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) .
Method	A systematic search of Medline ( 1964-2004 ) sought to identify all original reports of RCTs , as well as those reported in reviews and metaanalyses .
Method	We used the following key words RCT , doctor-patient relationship , doctor-patient communication , knowledge , skill , attitude , non-pharmacologic effectiveness , primary care .
Result	Ten RCTs and one metaanalysis provided evidence that a combination of emotional and cognitive care has a consistently positive effect on health outcomes .
Result	This effect relies on specific attitudes and skills : empathy , reassurance , explanation , counseling , influencing patients ' ` health beliefs and expectations , promoting change in behavior , thoughts or emotions .
Result	These can be integrated into a specific patient-centered approach to general practice .
Result	Medical education must provide training in the relational skills needed for effective treatment .
Result	Qualitative and quantitative research , including RCTs , are necessary ; they should be designed to deal with the heterogenous situations and specific characteristics of general practice .

Background	There have been only a few investigational reports of sleep apnea syndrome ( SAS ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , although it may not be a rare condition and may be life-threatening occasionally .
Background	The factor precipitating SAS in such patients is thought to be destruction of the temporomandibular joints ( TMJs ) from RA processes .
Method	To assess the relationship of the degree of destruction of the TMJs to the frequency of apnea , we examined them in 10 RA patients who complained of snoring .
Method	Those patients were classified as classical RA according to the criteria of American Rheumatism Association .
Method	They consisted of 3 males and 7 females with a mean age of 57.8 + 11.0 years and a mean disease duration of 15.9 + / - 9.4 years .
Method	In order to numerically evaluate the degree of destruction of the mandibular rami , we quoted a method from the literature ( Redlund-Johnell I , Scand J Rheumatol 16355 , 1987 ) and measured the vertical distance ( = ramal height ) from the mandibular angle to the palato-occipital line on the lateral view film of the cervical spine in each patient .
Method	The mean values of ramal height ( RH ) of the normal material ( we studied in Japanese ) are 46.0 mm in males and 38.3 mm in females .
Result	There were 8 cases of SAS out of the 10 RA patients studied .
Result	Their mean total apneic episode ( TAE ) was 289.9 mm with a range of 0-611 .
Result	The mean ratio ( % ) of RH to mean value of the normal material ( % RH ) was 68.8 + / - 22.2 % for all .
Result	( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Background	A qualitative study of parents ' perceptions of local environmental health risks was conducted to assess the fit between concepts from Dixon 's Integrative Environmental Health Model ( DIEH model ) and field-generated data .
Method	This research was part of a prospective study addressing environmental exposures of rural low-income children .
Method	Home visit data from 11 parents were analyzed ( 1 ) thematically and ( 2 ) according to DIEH concepts .
Method	These complementary analyses allowed the researchers to examine perceptions that were congruent with or diverged from the DIEH model .
Result	Findings revealed that participants were concerned about children 's exposure to pathogenic molds and cigarette smoke and felt uninformed about risks and prevention strategies .
Result	Barriers to preventive actions included families ' lack of time and a disinterest in brochures .
Result	Participants reported being `` stuck '' in substandard housing by poverty and family demands .
Result	Results provided the researchers with confidence that the DIEH model aligned with participants ' cognitive constructions of risk .
Result	As a result , the DIEH model was incorporated into the conceptualization for the clinical trial phase of the study .
Result	This type of check between a theoretical approach and field data can be a helpful intermediate step for researchers involved in multiyear studies .

Background	Ulcerative colitis , a chronic inflammatory disease of the rectal and colonic mucosa , affects approximately 250,000 to 500,000 people in the United States , with 30 % to 40 % of patients requiring some form of surgical intervention during the course of their
Background	The predominant reason for total proctocolectomy is for symptoms refractory to currently available medical therapy .
Background	Less common reasons are dysplasia or cancer .
Background	The goal of colectomy is to prevent recurrence of systemic inflammatory disease .
Method	Consequently , surgery with total proctocolectomy and creation of an ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis has become the procedure of choice for many patients without other therapeutic options .
Result	Health-related quality of life ( QOL ) in patients with severe ulcerative colitis is so poor that , after ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis , QOL is considered to improve in most clinical studies ( 8 studies , improved QOL ; 1 study , no change ; 1 study , QOL worse t
Result	However , QOL and bowel function after such surgery can not be considered `` normal '' in all patients , because a substantial number still have problems with urgency , leakage , nocturnal soiling , sexual dysfunction , and pouchitis , and some require conv
Result	Thus , despite the availability of ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis , surgery does not always restore all aspects of QOL to normal .

Background	Patients suffering from inoperable critical leg ischemia ( CLI ) ultimately face a major amputation .
Background	Spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) has been introduced as a possible treatment option .
Method	This paper presents the best available evidence from a systematic review on the effectiveness of SCS in these patients and discusses the indications for SCS therapy .
Result	A meta-analysis of six controlled trials , including 444 patients , showed 11 % ( 95 % confidence interval : -0.02 to -0.20 ) lower amputation rate after 12 months compared to those treated with optimum medical treatment .
Result	In addition , SCS patients required significantly fewer analgesics and showed a significant clinical improvement .
Result	These positive effects have to be weighed against the higher costs and ( generally minor ) complications of SCS .
Result	TcpO ( 2 ) measurements were found to be useful in selecting the most respondent patients , yielding a 12-month limb salvage up to 83 % .
Result	Hence , SCS should be considered as a possible treatment option in patients with CLI , particularly if their foot TcpO ( 2 ) is between 10 and 30 mmHg .

Method	A prospective and comparative analysis of tissue injury after mini-open lumbar fusion and conventional technique .
Method	To evaluate the tissue injury quantitatively after mini-open lumbar fusion .
Background	The advantages of minimally invasive techniques demonstrated by clinical reports have been a smaller scar , lesser pain , and rapid rehabilitation .
Background	It has not been established , however , that the minimally invasive technique has less tissue injury and less systemic response than the conventional spine surgery .
Method	Twenty patients who had undergone posterior decompression and the fusion of the L4-L5 segment for spinal stenosis were studied prospectively .
Method	Ten patients that had the conventional posterior decompression and posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF ) at L4-L5 were enrolled in a control group .
Method	The remaining 10 patients who underwent MISS techniques ( paramedian mini-open approach using a tubular retractor ) were enrolled in a study group .
Method	The serum enzymes representing skeletal muscle injury ( creatinine kinase and aldolase ) , pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , IL-8 ) , and anti-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-10 , IL-1 receptor antagonist ) were analyzed with ELISA techniques .
Method	They were checked on the day before operation and 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 days after operation .
Result	Serum creatinine kinase and most of the inflammatory cytokines were significantly high in the control group on postoperative days 1 and 3 and returned to the normal level on postoperative day 7 .
Result	Serum aldolase was significantly high on postoperative day 1 , and IL-8 remained elevated until postoperative day 7 in the control group .
Result	Mini-open lumbar fusion may significantly contribute to the reduction of muscle injury and systemic inflammatory reactions during the acute postoperative period .
Result	This study suggests that mini-open lumbar fusion may also play an important role in preventing medical morbidity after spinal surgery .

Background	Following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , paralyzed muscles undergo physiological changes that alter their force responses to electrical stimulation .
Background	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of SCI on the contractile properties and force-frequency relationship ( FFR ) of the paralyzed human quadriceps femoris muscle of adolescents and young adults .
Method	Thirteen subjects ( 11 male , 2 female ; age range = 11-24 years ) with motor complete SCIs and 13 matched control subjects ( 11 male , 2 female ; age range = 9-23 years ) without SCI participated in the study .
Method	Both groups of subjects underwent the same testing protocol using similar equipment .
Result	The paralyzed muscles of the subjects with SCI produced 62 % of the peak twitch force and had a fatigue ratio that was 65 % of that of the control subjects .
Result	The paralyzed muscles contracted 14 % and 25 % faster and relaxed 38 % and 46 % faster than the nonparalyzed muscles in nonfatigued and fatigued conditions , respectively .
Result	Compared with the control subjects , the subjects with SCI had twitch-to-tetanus ratios that were 84 % and 127 % greater in nonfatigued and fatigued conditions , respectively .
Result	Relative to the control subjects , the FFR of the subjects with SCI was shifted to the left in the fatigued condition .
Result	Relative to their respective nonfatigued conditions , the FFR of both groups of subjects shifted to the right with fatigue .
Result	These findings may have important implications for designing stimulation strategies to reduce the rapid fatigue that limits the clinical efficacy of functional electrical stimulation .

Background	The effect of poor blood stem cells mobilization on the outcome of autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) has not been well studied .
Background	Our aim is to evaluate poor mobilization as a prognostic factor in lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT .
Method	We analyzed 90 consecutive patients with Hodgkin 's ( HD ) and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) who underwent ASCT .
Method	Poor mobilization was defined as the inability to obtain > or = 1 x 10 ( 6 ) CD34 + cells/kg ideal body weight with two large volume aphereses .
Method	Patients were divided into 2 groups group 1 = poor mobilizers , and group 2 = good mobilizers .
Result	The poor mobilizers received lower median transplant CD34 + cell dose ( 2 x 10 ( 6 ) vs. 4.5 x 10 ( 6 ) / kg for good mobilizers , P = 0.001 ) , were more heavily pretreated ( P = 0.01 ) , and required higher number of aphereses for PBSC collection ( P = 0.0006 ) .
Result	The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) in groups 1 and 2 was 10 and 41 months ( P = 0.04 ) , while the median overall survival ( OS ) was 38 months and not reached ( P = 0.02 ) , respectively .
Result	Univariate analysis showed that > or = 3 pre-transplant treatments , CD34 + cell dose < or = 2 x 10 ( 6 ) , elevated LDH before transplant , and poor mobilization were significant prognostic factors for poor PFS , while only the first three were significant fo
Result	Multivariate analysis using these same four factors revealed that number of pre-transplant treatments ( HR = 6.03 , P = 0.001 ) , CD34 + cell dose ( HR = 0.1 , P = 0.0007 ) were the only independent predictive factors for worse overall outcome .
Result	In conclusion , our data show that poor mobilization could indicate poor outcome in lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT , however , it is more likely to be a reflection of the heavy pre-transplant therapy and lower CD34 + cell dose re-infused in this group of p

Method	The outcome in terms of health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) in pediatric spinal cord injury ( SCI ) was studied in 36 adults who had sustained an SCI in childhood .
Method	The patients were interviewed and clinically examined .
Method	HRQL was assessed with the 15D , a generic fifteen-dimensional self-administered HRQL instrument .
Background	The 15 multiple-level dimensions are moving , seeing , hearing , breathing , sleeping , eating , communicating , urinary continence , working , social participation , mental functioning , pain , depression , distress and perceived health .
Background	The respondents choose , for each dimension , the level that best describe their health status .
Background	In the 15D valuation system the respondents first assign a relative importance weight to each dimension and then a relative value to the levels on each dimension .
Background	To derive the 15D HRQL score on a 0-1 scale the level values and importance weights are multiplied and combined with the levels chosen .
Result	The average HRQL score of this SCI group was significantly lower than that measured in the population sample .
Result	The average importance weights assigned by the SCI group differed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) from those assigned by the general population on several dimensions .
Result	The weights assigned by the SCI group were higher for the dimensions of mental functioning , communicating , social participation and seeing and lower for moving , working , sleeping and eating .
Result	These differences in valuing the dimensions of HRQL can influence behaviour and should therefore be taken into consideration in rehabilitation .

Background	Counsellors are prevalent in primary care settings .
Background	However , there are concerns about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the treatments they provide , compared with alternatives such as usual care from the general practitioner , medication or other psychological therapies .
Method	To assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of counselling in primary care by reviewing cost and outcome data in randomised controlled trials , controlled clinical trials and controlled patient preference trials of counselling interventions in primary care , for patients with psychological and psychosocial problems considered suitable for counselling .
Method	The original search strategy included electronic searching of databases ( including the CCDAN Register of RCTs and CCTs ) along with handsearching of a specialist journal .
Method	Published and unpublished sources ( clinical trials , books , dissertations , agency reports etc. ) were searched , and their reference lists scanned to uncover further controlled trials .
Method	Contact was made with subject experts and CCDAN members in order to uncover further trials .
Method	For the updated review , searches were restricted to those databases judged to be high yield in the first version of the review MEDLINE , EMBASE , PSYCLIT and CINAHL , the Cochrane Controlled Trials register and the CCDAN trials register .
Method	All controlled trials comparing counselling in primary care with other treatments for patients with psychological and psychosocial problems considered suitable for counselling .
Method	Trials completed before the end of June 2001 were included in the review .
Method	Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction sheet .
Method	The relevant data were entered into the Review Manager software .
Method	Trials were quality rated , using CCDAN criteria , to assess the extent to which their design and conduct were likely to have prevented systematic error .
Method	Continuous measures of outcome were combined using standardised mean differences .
Method	An overall effect size was calculated for each outcome with 95 % confidence intervals .
Method	Continuous data from different measuring instruments were transformed into a standard effect size by dividing mean values by standard deviations .
Method	In view of the diversity of counselling services in primary care ( the range of treatments , patients and practitioners ) tests of heterogeneity were done to assess the feasibility of aggregating measures of outcome from trials .
Method	Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the results .
Method	Seven trials were included in the review .
Result	The main analyses showed significantly greater clinical effectiveness in the counselling group compared with ` usual care ' in the short-term ( standardised mean difference -0.28 , 95 % CI -0.43 to -0.13 , n = 772 , 6 trials ) but not the long-term ( standardised me
Result	Levels of satisfaction with counselling were high .
Result	Four studies reported similar total costs associated with counselling and usual care over the long-term .
Result	However , the economic analyses were likely to be underpowered .
Result	Counselling is associated with modest improvement in short-term outcome compared to ` usual care ' , but provides no additional advantages in the long-term .
Result	Patients are satisfied with counselling , and it may not be associated with increased costs .

Background	Bone metastasis from breast cancer often cause significant morbidity including pain , impaired mobility , pathological fracture , and spinal cord compression .
Background	Bisphosphonates play an important role in preventing these skeletal related events and are the standard of care for patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer .
Background	Ibandronate is a highly potent bisphosphonate available in both intravenous and oral preparations .
Background	It has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing skeletal complications and also significantly improve quality of life up to 96 weeks .
Background	Unlike other intravenous bisphosphonates , ibandronate has minimal renal toxicity , allowing safe outpatient administration , reducing the need for hospital attendance and safety monitoring .
Background	Early trials have shown ibandronate may also be effective in high doses for palliation of opioid-resistant pain from bone metastasis , and as a second-line agent in patients developing a skeletal complication whilst receiving another bisphosphonate .

Background	The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is sometimes difficult to establish early in the disease process , particularly in the absence of its classic hallmarks .
Background	Our aim was to compare the practical usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the hand versus anticyclic citrullinated peptide ( anti-CCP ) antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis of clinically suspected RA in the absence of rheumatoid factor ( RF
Method	We prospectively included patients with early inflammatory arthritis and strong clinical suspicion of RA , in whom initial complementary tests ( RF and radiographs of hands , wrists , and feet ) did not provide unequivocal confirmation of the diagnosis .
Method	In all patients , anti-CCP antibodies were assessed and contrast-enhanced MRI of the most affected hand was performed according to a specifically designed protocol .
Method	The MRI criterion for the diagnosis of RA was either the presence of synovitis with bone erosions or bone marrow edema , which is currently considered to be a forerunner of erosions .
Result	In the 40 patients ( 28 women ) , the mean age at diagnosis was 54 + / - 6 years and the median duration of symptoms was 4 + / - 2.6 months ( range 1.5 to 12 ) .
Result	Final diagnoses at 1-year follow-up were RA in 31 patients , undifferentiated arthritis in 7 ( 5 self-limiting ) , and psoriatic arthropathy ( PsA ) and antisynthetase syndrome in 1 patient each .
Result	Anti-CCP antibodies were positive only in 7 patients , all of whom were finally diagnosed with RA .
Result	The prevalence of anti-CCP positivity in our series of seronegative RA patients was thus 23 % ( 7/31 ) ; in these patients the anti-CCP antibodies had a specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI : 71.7 to 100 ) and sensitivity of 23 % ( 95 % CI : 9.6 to 41.1 ) .
Result	Use of the MRI criterion led to the correct diagnosis in 100 % of patients with RA and to false-positive results ( 1 with PsA and 1 with antisynthetase syndrome ) .
Result	The MRI criterion had a specificity of 78 % ( 95 % CI : 40.0 to 97.2 ) and sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI : 90.8 to 100 ) for identification of seronegative RA .
Result	Although the tests are not mutually exclusive , in our experience MRI is more helpful than anti-CCP antibody determination in confirming the diagnosis of clinically suspected early RA in patients in whom the diagnosis can not be confirmed using conventional

Method	Twenty-three consecutive patients presenting for in vitro fertilization were evaluated with transvaginal sonography on cycle day 3 , prior to initiating ovarian hyperstimulation .
Method	Three of these patients were noted to have large ovarian cysts .
Method	All three underwent transvaginal aspiration of the cysts , followed immediately by initiation of ovarian hyperstimulation .
Result	Following oocyte retrieval , in vitro fertilization , and embryo transfer , all three women achieved pregnancy .
Result	We conclude that cyst aspiration is not contraindicated when an ovarian cyst is encountered in the follicular phase of an in vitro fertilization cycle .

Background	In the present brief overview we summarize results from several studies focusing on two neuropeptides , galanin and neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) in discrete neuronal systems , where they coexist with classic transmitters .
Background	On the basis of studies in different animal models we propose that these peptides may be involved in regulation of certain CNS functions and that drugs acting on their receptors may be of use in new therapeutic strategies .
Background	At the spinal level galanin and NPY are regulated in DRG neurons by nerve injury and in dorsal horn neurons by inflammation .
Background	It is possible that this leads to attenuation of pain sensitivity .
Background	Moreover , both peptides may exert trophic effects , for example to enhance regeneration .
Background	In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus NPY and its receptors are part of the feeding circuitry , and we suggest that derangement of these NPY neurons may at least in part underlay the lethal phenotype of anorectic mice , which die 22 days postnatally after sho
Background	Expression of NPY and NPY receptors is changed in the hippocampus of mice comparatively early after prion inoculation , indicating that this peptide system is affected in this spongiform degenerative disease in a region of importance for learning and memor
Background	Finally , galanin is co-localized with classic monoamine transmitters in two central systems , the dorsal raphe serotonin neurons and the locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons .
Background	In both cases galanin causes hyperpolarization ( at high concentrations ) and prolongs monoamine-induced outward currents ( at low concentrations ) , thus modulating activity in two systems of importance for many brain functions including mood regulation .
Background	It may therefore be interesting to analyse to what extent drugs affecting galaninergic transmission also may be efficient in the treatment of , for example , depression .

Background	Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) occurs when brain tissue is subjected to stresses and strains at high rates and magnitudes , yet the mechanisms of injury and cellular thresholds are not well understood .
Background	The events that occur at the time of and immediately after an insult are hypothesized to initiate cell dysfunction or death following a critical cell strain and strain rate .
Method	We analyzed neuronal plasma membrane disruption in two in vitro injury models-fluid shear stress delivered to planar cultures and shear strain induction of 3-D neural cultures .
Result	We found that insult severity positively correlated with the degree of membrane disruptions in a heterogeneous fashion in both cell configurations .
Result	Furthermore , increased membrane permeability led to increases in electrophysiological disturbance .
Result	Specifically , cells that exhibited increased membrane permeability did not fire random action potentials , in contrast to neighboring cells that had intact plasma membranes .
Result	This approach provides an experimental framework to investigate injury tolerance criteria as well as mechanistically driven therapeutic strategies .

Background	Older individuals with TBI differ from younger adults with TBI in several ways , including their incidence rates , etiology of injury , nature of complications , lengths of hospitalization , functional outcomes , and mortality .
Background	Despite the greater likelihood of poorer functional outcomes , older adults with TBI often achieve good functional outcomes and can live in community settings after receiving appropriate rehabilitation services , although at higher costs and longer hospital
Result	The future of rehabilitation care for elderly patients after TBI is uncertain due to financial limitations associated with the implementation of the PPS payment system by CMS .
Result	Little is known regarding the long-term impact of TBI on individuals as they age , but this is an important issue as the population ages .

Background	Breastfeeding has a major impact on HCMV epidemiology .
Background	The incidence of postnatal HCMV reactivation during lactation equals the maternal seroprevalence .
Background	Infectious virus , viral DNA and RNA can be isolated easily from cell and fat-free milk whey .
Background	Early onset of viral DNAlactia and virolactia as well as high viral load in milk whey are maternal risk factors for virus transmission .
Background	The dynamics of HCMV reactivation can be described by unimodal kinetics with interindividual variation .
Background	Virus reactivation during lactation is a self-limiting local process in the absence of systemic HCMV infection .
Background	Preterm infants below 1000g birthweight and a gestational age below 30 weeks may be at high risk of acquiring a symptomatic HCMV infection .
Background	Several recent studies described low transmission rates and mostly asymptomatically infected neonates using frozen milk .
Result	Despite different freeze-storing procedures , HCMV transmissions occurred , and severe HCMV infections were observed .
Result	Few data exist on the long-term outcome of postnatally acquired HCMV infection via breast milk .
Result	To substantiate the international debate on the use of native or inactivated milk for feeding of preterm infants , additional data are necessary for better identification of mother-infant-pairs at risk for viral transmission and symptomatic infection early

Background	To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of calcitonin suppositories ( 200 IU ) in comparison with bed rest and paracetamol tablets , as a rescue analgesic .
Method	A prospective , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , clinical trial .
Method	Forty patients ( 8 men and 32 postmenopausal women ) , who had recently ( within the last 5 days ) suffered a nontraumatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture .
Method	All patients were admitted to the hospital , divided randomly into two groups and received either one calcitonin or placebo suppository once a day , respectively , for 28 days .
Method	All patients were allowed to take paracetamol tablets ( 500 mg ) , with a maximum dose of six tablets daily .
Method	Spinal pain evaluation was performed at the beginning of the study ( before the initiation of treatment ) and then daily until the end of the study ( day 28 ) using the Huskinsson 's visual analog scale ( VAS ) and a painmeter device , by direct pressure on the fractured vertebra .
Method	Pain was evaluated with the patients attempting or performing four different locomotor functions , e.g. , bed rest , sitting , standing , and walking functions .
Method	Biochemical urine and plasma measurements were carried out before the initiation of treatment and on days 14 and 28 .
Result	All calcitonin-treated patients experienced an overall statistically significant ( all p values < 0.001 ) decrease of spinal pain as assessed by the VAS and the painmeter device .
Result	Pain relief allowed for early mobilization and the gradual restoration of the locomotive functions in the calcitonin-treated group .
Result	Placebo-treated patients remained in bed for almost the whole of the observation period .
Result	At the end of the study ( 28th day ) , fasting osteocalcin , hydroxyproline/creatinine , and calcium/creatinine ratio values were statistically significantly ( all p values < 0.001 ) , lower in the calcitonin-treated than in the placebo-treated patients .
Result	In the placebo group these values showed a gradual increase .
Result	In the calcitonin-treated group side effects mainly included dizziness and enteric irritation caused by the suppositories .
Result	Enteric irritation was also present in the placebo-treated group .
Result	Salmon calcitonin suppositories ( 200 IU daily ) caused a dramatic decrease in spinal pain in patients with recent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and influenced the early mobilization and the gradual restoration of their locomotor functions .

Result	A cytotoxic factor ( CF ) appeared in murine serum after the intravenous injection of the dehydrogenation polymers ( DHPs ) of p-coumaric acid ( DHP-pCA ) , caffeic acid ( DHP-CA ) , and ferulic acid ( DHP-FA ) , which are categorized as a class of synthetic lignins .
Result	The highest CF activity was observed 15 min after the i.v. injection of DHP-pCA .
Background	CF is likely to be cytocidal through an apoptotic mechanism accompanied by nucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation .
Background	CF is extractable with aqueous ethanol and highly stable against heat , proteases , and acid/alkali treatments .
Result	The ethanol extract showed cytotoxicity toward various cultured cell lines and also ascites carcinoma cells in vivo .
Result	The parent molecules DHPs did not show any appreciable cytotoxicity .
Result	After the induction of CF activity , the activity quickly diminished and completely disappeared from the blood stream within an hour or so .
Result	The cytotoxicity was observed only when the target cells were exposed to CF for longer than 10 h.

Background	A number of risk factors have been associated with osteoporosis , but few of them are particularly strong predictors of low bone mass or increased fracture incidence and the `` best '' set of variables changes from study to study .
Background	This does not provide adequate precision for classifying individual patients , and the focus of risk assessment , especially in perimenopausal women , has been on in vivo bone mass measurements .
Background	Prospective studies show that these values correspond to subsequent fracture incidence , and there is currently no alternative to bone mass measurements for stratifying patients by fracture risk .
Background	However , the level of risk at which treatment should be initiated for fracture prevention has not been agreed upon .
Background	Additional research is needed to refine risk factors for low bone mass and for falls and to design interventions to reduce the impact of osteoporosis in the population .

Background	Reconstruction and stabilization of the cervical spine after vertebrectomy is an important goal in the surgical management of spinal metastasis .
Background	The authors describe their reconstruction technique using a titanium cage-Silastic tube construct injected with polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) augmented by an anterior cervical plate .
Method	The surgical results using this technique are reviewed .
Method	Six patients ranging from 43 to 70 years of age underwent resection of metastatic tumor in the cervical spine followed by cage-assisted PMMA reconstruction of the anterior spinal column .
Method	The following reconstruction technique was performed .
Method	A Silastic tube is incised longitudinally and placed circumferentially around a titanium cage with the opening facing anteriorly .
Method	The cage-Silastic tube construct is carefully tapped into the corpectomy defect and filled with PMMA .
Method	The final construct is then augmented with anterior cervical plate fixation .
Result	Two patients required additional posterior stabilization with lateral mass screws and rods .
Result	All patients achieved immediate stabilization , restoration of vertebral body height and normal lordosis , and preservation of the ability to walk independently .
Result	Five patients experienced significant palliation of biomechanical neck pain .
Result	There were no complications of neurological worsening , postoperative hematoma , wound infection , subsidence , graft dislodgement , or construct failure during a follow-up period of 1 to 19 months ( mean , 6.8 mo ) .
Result	Titanium cage-assisted PMMA reconstruction augmented with an anterior cervical plate is an effective means of reconstruction after tumor resection in patients with cervical spinal metastasis .
Result	The Silastic tube holds the PMMA within the cage and protects the spinal cord from potential thermal injury .

Background	Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis is observed in more than 90 % of all cases of multiple sclerosis , producing a specific CSF IgG oligoclonal electrophoretic pattern .
Background	The consensual method used as reference is isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) .
Background	We developed a new CSF Ig analysis method by immunofixation ( IF ) .
Method	The method includes an immunoenzymatic detection step performed directly on the gel allowing the use of unconcentrated CSF and avoiding the blotting step .
Background	The reliability of this method was established by the analysis of 210 CSF/serum pairs including defined , probable and possible MS , other inflammatory CNS diseases and controls ( noninflammatory CNS diseases and peripheral nervous system diseases ) .
Result	Intrathecal IgG synthesis was detected in 95.5 % of defined MS cases .
Result	The specificity for CNS inflammatory diseases including MS diagnosis , evaluated by comparison with controls , was 98.8 % .
Result	This new method is quicker and visual interpretation is easier than with IEF .
Result	It is a semi-automated method that should be considered for standardization of CSF IgG analysis .

Background	Muscle strains and other musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs ) are a leading cause of work absenteeism .
Background	Muscle pain , spasm , swelling , and inflammation are symptomatic of strains .
Background	The precise relationship between musculoskeletal pain and spasm is not well understood .
Background	The dictum that pain induces spasm , which causes more pain , is not substantiated by critical analysis .
Method	The painful muscle may not show EMG activity , and when there is , the timing and intensity often do not correlate with the pain .
Method	Clinical and physiologic studies show that pain tends to inhibit rather than facilitate reflex contractile activity .
Background	The decision to treat and choice of therapy are largely dictated by the duration , severity of symptoms , and degree of dysfunction .
Background	Trigger point injections are sometimes used with excellent results in the treatment of muscle spasm in myofacial pain and low-back pain .
Result	NSAIDs are used with much greater frequency than oral skeletal muscle relaxants ( SMRs ) or opioids in the treatment of acute MSDs .
Result	Unfortunately , remarkably little sound science guides the choice of drug for the treatment of acute , uncomplicated MSDs , and the evaluation of efficacy of one agent over another is complicated by numerous factors .
Result	Only a limited number of high-quality , randomized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) provide evidence of the effectiveness of NSAIDs or SMRs in the treatment of acute , uncomplicated MSDs .
Result	The quality of design , execution , and reporting of trials for the treatment of MSDs needs to be improved .
Result	The combination of an SMR and an NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor or the combination of SMR and tramadol/acetaminophen is superior to single agents alone .

Background	Relief of chronic pain over the lateral aspect of the leg through decompression of the superficial peroneal nerve where it emerges from the deep fascia of the leg .
Method	Chronic pain over the lateral side ( lower quarter ) of the leg and the dorsum of the ankle exaggerated by activities of daily living and sports ; sometimes sensory abnormality or decreased sensibility in the distribution of the nerve over the dorsum of the foot .
Method	Presence of a positive Tinel-Hoffmann sign at the site of compression .
Method	Occasional pain or absence of chronic pain .
Method	Before starting spinal anesthesia , the site of nerve compression has to be identified ( Tinel-Hoffmann sign ) and marked .
Method	Supine position , internal rotation of the affected leg .
Method	Thigh tourniquet .
Method	Longitudinal skin incision over the lateral aspect of the leg 1 cm posterior to the site of compression .
Method	The nerve is released by local fasciotomy where it emerges through the deep fascia .
Method	Release of the tourniquet and careful hemostasis .
Method	No suture of the fascia .
Method	Subcutaneous and skin suture .
Method	Sterile compressive dressing .
Result	Between November 1998 and April 2003 , a decompression of the superficial peroneal nerve was performed in twelve legs of twelve patients ( seven men and five women , average age 40 years [ 18-50 years ] ) .
Result	Follow-up after an average of 48 months ( 12-84 months ) based on subjective and clinical evaluation .
Result	The clinical examination consisted of the search for Tinel-Hoffmann sign and subjective assessment on a questionnaire .
Result	Postoperatively , at clinical examination no entrapment sign was found in any patient .
Result	The subjective rating was excellent in eight patients and good in four .
Result	It had always improved when compared with the preoperative situation .
Result	All patients would accept the surgery again for an identical condition .

Background	Diffuse and focal traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) can result in perceptual , cognitive , and motor dysfunction possibly leading to activity limitations in driving .
Background	Characteristic dysfunctions for severe diffuse TBI are confronted with function requirements derived from the hierarchical task analysis of driving skill .
Background	Specifically , we focus on slow information processing , divided attention , and the development of procedural knowledge .
Background	Also the effects of a combination of diffuse and focal dysfunctions , specifically homonymous hemianopia and the dysexecutive syndrome , are discussed .
Background	Finally , we turn to problems and challenges with regard to assessment and rehabilitation methods in the areas of driving and fitness to drive .

Background	To assess the efficacy of acute intrathecal ( i.t. ) baclofen on chronic , dysesthetic , and spasm-related pain ( SRP ) among patients with spinal spasticity [ i.e. , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , transverse myelitis ( TMy ) ] .
Method	Double-blind , randomized , and placebo ( vehicle ) controlled trials ( n = 7 ) , and nonrandomized , nonblinded trials ( n = 2 ) .
Method	In-patient program at Samaritan Rehabilitation Institute , Phoenix , Arizona , U.S.A.
Method	INT
Method	Electromyographic ( EMG ) activity ; intravesical and intraurethral pressures ; Ashworth Scale and tendon response values ; visual analog scales for describing dysesthetic pain intensity ; and threshold/EMG relationships after controlled pinch as an indication of nociceptive pain .
Result	i.t. baclofen ( a ) caused marked reduction of segmental reflexes before suppression of intersegmental reflexes ; ( b ) significantly suppressed dysesthetic pain and SRP with temporal dissociation ; and ( 3 ) did not influence pinch-induced and musculoskeletal ( l
Result	The suppressive action of i.t. baclofen on spontaneous and evoked ( allodynia ) dysesthetic pain suggests that a dysfunctional spinal gamma-aminobutyric acidB receptor system , including functional supersensitivity , is associated with the phenomenon of centr
Result	Temporal dissociation regarding the action on dysesthetic pain and SRP suggests that disparate central mechanisms subserve the two clinical states .

Background	The metabolic syndrome ( MS ) is highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia ( current estimates 35-40 % ) , yet no data exist on the correlation of this diagnosis with illness severity , neurocognitive or quality of life measures in this population .
Method	Using baseline data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) Schizophrenia Trial , assignment of MS status was performed using an updated definition derived from the National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) criteria .
Method	Those with and without MS were compared on the basis of primary and secondary variables of interest from baseline data encompassing psychiatric , neurocognitive and quality of life measures .
Result	Of 1460 subjects enrolled at baseline , MS status could be reliably assigned for 1231 subjects , with a prevalence of 35.8 % using the NCEP derived criteria .
Result	After adjustment for age , gender , race , ethnicity and site variance , those with MS rated themselves significantly lower on physical health by SF-12 ( p < .001 ) , and scored higher on somatic preoccupation ( PANSS item G1 ) ( p = .03 ) .
Result	There were no significant differences between the two cohorts on measures of symptom severity , depression , quality of life , neurocognition , or self-rated mental health .
Result	Neither years of antipsychotic exposure nor alcohol usage were significant predictors of MS status when adjusted for age , gender , race , and ethnicity .
Result	The metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in this large cohort of schizophrenia patients and is strongly associated with a poor self-rating of physical health and increased somatic preoccupation .
Result	These results underscore the need for mental health practitioners to take an active role in the health monitoring of patients with schizophrenia to minimize the impact of medical comorbidity on long-term mortality and on daily functioning .
Result	Outcomes data from CATIE will provide important information on the metabolic and clinical impact of antipsychotic treatment for those subjects with MS and other medical comorbidities .
