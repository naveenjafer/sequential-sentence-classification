background	Although adolescents in Reunion have a pregnancy rate of 77/1000 , twice that of France , there are no published studies on the themes of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood .
population	105 women under 18 including 20 aged 14 who gave birth in 1 maternity center were analyzed for sociofamilial characteristics and perinatal complications .
outcome	The educational level of the adolescent mothers was low and 47 % had stopped school before the pregnancy .
outcome	1/3 expected to find employment or return to work after delivery .
outcome	19 % were already in consensual unions at the time of pregnancy and 34 % had entered such unions after delivery .
outcome	It was the 2nd pregnancy for 11.5 % .
outcome	Only 8.5 % used contraception .
outcome	The age difference with the partner was over 5 years for more than half .
outcome	68 % had known the father for more than 1 year .
outcome	At the time of pregnancy , 35 % lived in families with 2 parents and 36 % in households headed by their mothers .
outcome	Heads of 50 % of all their households and 80 % of those headed by the mothers were unemployed .
outcome	44 % had more than 6 siblings .
outcome	20 % had 1 or more sisters who were adolescent mothers .
outcome	Comparison with a group of 62 adolescents seeking abortions at the same center indicated several factors that appeared to encourage continuation of the pregnancy ; including being below age level in school , absence of plans for education or employment , lim
outcome	Risk factors at the level of the family included absence of the father , maternal tolerance , poverty , and sisters who were single mothers .
outcome	27 % states retrospectively that they would have preferred to terminate the pregnancy , but all stated they were satisfied after the delivery .
outcome	41 % had problems in pregnancy or delivery .
outcome	10.5 % had toxemia and 23 % had low birth weight babies .

background	Patients with transmurally invasive , lymph node negative colorectal carcinoma ( Dukes ' B ) have a 5-year survival rate ranging from 53.9 % to 84.9 % .
background	The authors postulate that patients with Dukes ' B colon cancer who die of their disease have occult micrometastases in their pericolic lymph nodes at the time of original diagnosis .
background	In an attempt to identify these occult micrometastases , pericolic lymph nodes from Dukes ' B colon cancer resections were stained retrospectively with antibodies against cytokeratin ( anti-keratin AE1/AE3 , Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and CC49 ( a
other	The results were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis .
outcome	Fifty cases with 568 lymph nodes ( 11.3 per case ) were examined with each antibody using standard immunoperoxidase techniques .
outcome	Positive staining for cytokeratin was seen in 14 patients ( 33 lymph nodes ) , 6 of whom died of colon cancer within 66 months ( 43 % ) .
outcome	Only 1 of the 36 patients with cytokeratin-negative lymph nodes died of colon cancer over the same time period ( 3 % , P = 0.0009 univariate , P = 0.0013 multivariate ) .
outcome	There was no significant difference in survival between the CC49-positive and CC49-negative groups .
outcome	Immunoperoxidase techniques are capable of identifying micrometastatic disease in lymph nodes missed by routine hematoxylin and eosin staining .
outcome	Further , the presence of cytokeratin-positive cells within lymph nodes correlated with a significantly poorer prognosis .
outcome	Therefore , cytokeratin staining of pericolic lymph nodes in patients with Dukes ' B colorectal cancer is recommended .
outcome	Larger multicenter studies are needed , however , to confirm these results and to evaluate the appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients whose disease is upstaged by immunohistochemical staining .

background	Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is a gastrointestinal emergency in neonates .
background	Whether NEC affects infants ' growth and development is controversial .
other	The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and outcome and to assess the effect of NEC on growth and neurodevelopment in infants .
population	A total of 80 neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from January 1991 to April 2002 with definite , advanced NEC , including 48 with modified Bell 's stage II and 32 with stage III .
other	Sixty six of the patients were premature .
other	Very low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infants without NEC were used as matching controls for the 15 infants with VLBW .
other	The growth and neurodevelopment of patients and controls were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II and compared at 6 and 18 months of corrected age .
outcome	NEC developed an average of 27.7 days after feeding began .
outcome	The most common initial signs were abdominal distension , decreased activity , hematochezia , and abdominal tenderness .
outcome	Thirty four patients ( 43 % ) required surgical intervention .
outcome	Three infants developed short bowel syndrome after surgical resection .
outcome	The overall mortality was 24 % ( 19/80 ) and was mostly associated with extensive bowel involvement and NEC-related sepsis or multiple organ failure .
outcome	Of the surviving 61 infants , 12 ( 20 % ) developed intestinal strictures , 2 in the ileum , 6 in the colon , and 4 in both ileum and colon .
outcome	Compared with controls , the VLBW infants with NEC were shorter and had delayed psychomotor development at 18 months of corrected age .
outcome	Mental development , however , did not differ significantly .
outcome	Intestinal stricture was the most common gastrointestinal complication in this series of infants with NEC .
outcome	Besides the bowel sequelae , VLBW infants who survive NEC are at risk for impairment of growth and neurodevelopment .

background	Bone metastasis from breast cancer often cause significant morbidity including pain , impaired mobility , pathological fracture , and spinal cord compression .
background	Bisphosphonates play an important role in preventing these skeletal related events and are the standard of care for patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer .
background	Ibandronate is a highly potent bisphosphonate available in both intravenous and oral preparations .
background	It has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing skeletal complications and also significantly improve quality of life up to 96 weeks .
background	Unlike other intravenous bisphosphonates , ibandronate has minimal renal toxicity , allowing safe outpatient administration , reducing the need for hospital attendance and safety monitoring .
background	Early trials have shown ibandronate may also be effective in high doses for palliation of opioid-resistant pain from bone metastasis , and as a second-line agent in patients developing a skeletal complication whilst receiving another bisphosphonate .

###10582786
background	Low-dose follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) regimens for induction of ovulation for women with polycystic ovaries have succeeded in reducing the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) almost to nil and the rate of multiple pregnancies to a minim
background	This has been achieved by reaching , but not exceeding , the threshold level of FSH , starting with a daily dose of 75 IU for 14 days , using small incremental dose rises where necessary , and inducing uniovulation in 70 % of cycles .
outcome	Conception rates are as good , if not better , than those achieved with conventional therapy .
outcome	The miscarriage rate is still relatively high ( 20-25 % ) and obese women fare worse .
outcome	Serum oestradiol concentrations and the number of large and intermediate follicles on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin administration are much lower , in parallel with lower serum FSH concentrations .
outcome	Inhibin values increase with the rise in serum FSH concentrations but those of luteinizing hormone decrease steadily throughout the follicular phase .
outcome	New data using recombinant hFSH ( rhFSH ) , rather than urinary gonadotrophin as the ovarian stimulant , demonstrate that treatment time is shortened .
outcome	However , the ideal regimen has still to be formulated .

background	Overall , this study demonstrates significant deficiencies in end-of-life care content in nursing textbooks .
background	Defining palliative care , quality of life at the end of life , and issues of policy , ethics , and law are the foundation of end-of-life care .
background	Analysis of these topics revealed a need to clarify concepts and to apply them within the context of end-of-life care .
background	The analysis also demonstrated a need to transfer findings from palliative care research and concepts from hospice into basic education .
background	In March 1999 the investigators convened a conference in New York in collaboration with a group of medical investigators analyzing EOL content in medical textbooks .
background	The conference was also attended by publishers , editors , and authors of textbooks .

###16608618
background	Obesity is well known to be associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic complications .
background	Severe obesity is thus expected to have more important alterations of the metabolic profile than moderate obesity .
other	This study aimed to compare the metabolic profile of pre - and postmenopausal severely obese women with moderately obese women .
population	First , the metabolic profile of pre - ( n = 165 ) and postmenopausal ( n = 43 ) severely obese women ( body mass index ( BMI ) > or = 40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) was compared to that of pre - ( n = 52 ) and postmenopausal ( n = 35 ) moderately obese women ( BMI of 30-40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) .
other	Thereafter , pre - and postmenopausal severely obese women were divided into two subgroups according to the presence/absence of a dysmetabolic profile .
other	We used for comparison , a group of pre - and postmenopausal moderately obese women without a dysmetabolic profile .
outcome	The metabolic profile of pre - and postmenopausal severely obese women was less deteriorated than expected when compared to moderately obese women .
outcome	Moreover , severely obese women with or without a dysmetabolic profile displayed comparable or even lower plasma levels of cholesterol , HDL and LDL-cholesterol , and a lower cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio than moderately obese women ( P < or = 0.05 ) .
outcome	After menopause , the metabolic profile of severely obese women , dysmetabolic or not , was similar to that of moderately obese women .
outcome	Blood pressure was , however , higher in severely obese women compared to moderately obese women , only before menopause ( P < or = 0.0001 ) .
outcome	These results indicate that despite their large accumulation of adipose tissue , most of the severely obese women had a metabolic profile less deteriorated than expected , when compared to moderately obese women .

###17884841
background	Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in the Western world .
study design	In a pilot scale study , we highlight changes in the total serum glycome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer that might shed insight into disease pathogenesis .
background	These changes include increases in levels of core fucosylated , agalactosyl biantennary glycans ( FA2 ) and sialyl Lewis x ( SLe ( x ) ) .
other	To investigate further which proteins contribute to these alterations , we developed technology to analyze simultaneously the glycosylation of protein glycoforms contained in single spots excised from a 2D gel ( < 1 ng protein ) .
outcome	The acute-phase proteins , haptoglobin , alpha1-acid glycoprotein , and alpha1-antichymotrypsin from patients contained elevated levels of subsets of glycoforms containing SLe ( x ) .
outcome	We also established that IgG heavy chains from patients contained twice the level of FA2 compared with healthy controls .
outcome	Serum CA125 is the only biomarker that is used routinely , and there is a need for complementary markers that will improve both sensitivity and specificity .
outcome	There was some preliminary indication that combinations of changes in the serum glycome might improve the separation of ovarian cancer and benign tumors ; however , a larger study using data receiver operating characteristic curves will be required to draw

background	Serotonin basic neuroscience discoveries are evolving at a very fast pace and are leading to innovations in clinical psychiatry and in drug development .
background	Numerous novel pharmacological tools , each selective for a given serotonin receptor subtype , are being applied to several psychiatric disorders .
background	The strategy employed is theory driven and hypothesis oriented , aiming for new drug development that selectively targets receptors that are rational sites for therapeutic actions .
background	Thus , serotonin uptake inhibitors are targeting not only depression , but also obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
background	Serotonin1A agonists are targeting not only depression and anxiety , but also mixed anxiety depression .
background	These and other agents selective for additional receptors are being tested in impulse control disorders ; eating disorders ; addictive disorders ; and aggressive , violent , self-destructive , and suicidal behaviors .
background	Serotonin research is an excellent example of how basic science discoveries in the 1990 's `` Decade of the Brain '' are resulting in important advances in therapeutics for psychiatry .

background	To identify key factors associated with outcomes of patients who underwent 8 weeks of physical therapy ( PT ) for lateral epicondylitis .
study design	Multicenter prospective design with inception cohort of lateral epicondylitis patients commencing PT .
other	Baseline clinical examinations were conducted by 1 physical therapist ; self-report outcome measures were completed at baseline and 8 weeks later .
other	Nine private sports medicine clinics and 2 hospital outpatient departments in Ontario , Canada .
population	Eighty-three patients with unilateral lateral epicondylitis identified by the treating physical therapists .
other	Not applicable .
other	The final scores of the Disability of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire and a vertical pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) were used as the dependent variables .
outcome	The final prognostic model for the 8-week DASH scores included the baseline score ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.34-0 .66 ) , sex ( female ) ( 95 % CI , 3.3-14 .5 ) , and self-reported nerve symptoms ( 95 % CI , 0.8-13 .8 ) .
outcome	The model for the 8-week VAS scores included the baseline score ( 95 % CI , 0.01-0 .37 ) , sex ( female ) ( 95 % CI , 0.4-18 .2 ) , and self-reported nerve symptoms ( 95 % CI , 4.7-25 .5 ) .
outcome	A subanalysis indicated that women were more likely than men to have work-related onsets , repetitive keyboarding jobs , and cervical joint signs .
outcome	Among women , these factors were associated with higher final DASH and VAS scores .
outcome	Women and patients who report nerve symptoms are more likely to experience a poorer short-term outcome after PT management of lateral epicondylitis .
outcome	Work-related onsets , repetitive keyboarding jobs , and cervical joint signs have a prognostic influence on women .

background	To establish ( 1 ) whether associated reactions could contribute to contracture formation and ( 2 ) whether the presence of spasticity was essential for their expression , after stroke .
population	Subjects were 24 hemiparetics within 13 months of a stroke , unselected for contracture or spasticity .
other	Associated reactions were identified by the presence of muscle activity in the affected biceps brachii and quantified as the amount of affected elbow flexor torque produced during a moderate contraction of either the contralateral biceps brachii or the contralateral quadriceps muscles .
other	Contracture was measured as loss of elbow joint range of motion and spasticity as the presence of abnormal reflex activity .
outcome	Associated reactions were present in at least one testing condition in seven subjects .
outcome	During contractions of the contralateral biceps brachii , the median amount of elbow flexor torque produced was 0.39 ( interquartile range , IQR 2.5 ) Nm while during contractions of the contralateral quadriceps muscle it was 0.19 ( IQR 1.6 ) Nm .
outcome	Associated reactions were not associated with contracture ( p = 0.39 ) which was present in over half of the subjects .
outcome	The incidence of associated reactions was about the same as that of spasticity , but the two were not related ( p = 0.61 ) .
outcome	Even though associated reactions were present in 29 % of the subjects during moderate contraction of the contralateral muscles , they were not large , nor were they associated with contracture or spasticity , suggesting that this phenomenon is not usually a m

###17253573
background	A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting , but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting .
background	The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess ; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear .
background	In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering , it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies .
background	Also , the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals ; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a ` one size fits all ' kind of explanatio
background	Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a ` trial and error ' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander .
background	While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non-pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects , in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment .
other	This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non-pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs .
population	To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia .
other	The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research .
other	The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 11 May 2006 using the terms exit * or wander * or elopement or ambulat * or walk * .
other	This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly .
other	Randomised clinical trials comparing intervention with no intervention or usual treatment ( ` standard care ' ) or another intervention .
other	No suitable trials of non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention and management of wandering in the domestic setting were found .
outcome	As no randomised controlled trials were found , no results can be reported .
outcome	There is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting .

###1714897
background	The JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cell line transports serotonin , accumulating the monoamine inside the cell against a concentration gradient .
background	The transport is energized by an NaCl gradient .
outcome	Tricyclic ( imipramine and desipramine ) and non-tricyclic ( paroxetine and fluoxetine ) antidepressants inhibit the transporter markedly , but reserpine and 5-hydroxytryptophan do not .
outcome	Ouabain , gramicidin , and nigericin , which reduce or abolish the transmembrane Na + gradient , and phloridzin , which interferes with glucose transport into the cells , inhibit the transport .
outcome	Preincubation of the cells with glucose-free medium also causes similar inhibition .
outcome	The activity of the serotonin transporter in this cell line is stimulated in response to overnight ( 16-h ) incubation with increasing concentrations of cholera toxin ( 0.1-1 ,000 ng/ml ) .
outcome	Under these conditions the stimulation is maximal at 10 ng/ml cholera toxin ( 3.1 + / - 0.2-fold ) .
outcome	Cholera toxin increases the cAMP content of these cells by several hundredfold within 2 h.
outcome	Isobutylmethylxanthine ( 100 microM ) , dibutyryl cAMP ( 100 microM ) , and forskolin ( 100 microM ) mimic the action of cholera toxin , eliciting a 1.6-2 .5 - fold stimulation of the serotonin transporter activity .
outcome	The stimulatory effect of cholera toxin is antagonized significantly by simultaneous incubation of the cells with 50 microM N - ( 2-aminoethyl ) -5 - isoquinolinesulfonamide , a protein kinase inhibitor .
outcome	The effect of cholera toxin on serotonin transport is specific because , under similar conditions , cholera toxin inhibits 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport and does not influence taurine transport in this cell line .
outcome	There is also no significant change in the protein content of the cells after cholera toxin treatment .
outcome	Kinetic analysis reveals that cholera toxin causes an increase in the maximal velocity ( 7.89 + / - 0.67 to 17.55 + / - 1.06 pmol/mg of protein/5 min ) and a decrease in the Michaelis-Menten constant ( 0.52 + / - 0.09 to 0.29 + / - 0.04 microM ) .
outcome	These data show that the JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cell line expresses a high affinity serotonin transporter that is sensitive to inhibition by antidepressants and that the activity of the transporter is under cAMP-dependent regulation .

population	The beneficial effects of ventral intermediate nucleus ( VIM ) stimulation were evaluated in 20 patients with tremor refractory to medical therapy .
background	Thalamic stimulation is a non-ablative procedure which has the advantage of a reversible , non-destructive lesion .
intervention	Eleven patients [ 7 with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and 4 with essential tremor ( ET ) ] received unilateral VIM implantation , while 9 patients had staged bilateral VIM implantation ( 4 with PD , 5 with ET ) .
outcome	PD patients showed a significant improvement in contralateral arm and leg rest tremor and ipsilateral leg rest tremor ( p < 0.02 ) at a mean follow-up period of 16.2 + / - 7.0 months .
outcome	Patients with PD did not demonstrate any significant decrease in medication use at follow-up .
outcome	ET patients demonstrated significant improvement in postural and action tremor in the contralateral arm ( p < 0.001 ) , but no significant improvement in the contralateral leg tremor at follow-up .
outcome	1 months .
outcome	Deep brain stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for severe tremor refractory to medications .
outcome	It is a highly effective , reversible , adaptable , and predictable procedure which avoids the complication of cognitive deficit seen in patients with bilateral thalamotomies .

###16625603
background	Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism ( PE ) .
background	Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clot more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE .
background	However , there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy , such as major or minor haemorrhages .
other	To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE .
other	We sought trials through the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group 's Specialised Register ( January 18 , 2006 ) , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( The Cochrane Library Issue 1 , 2006 ) , MEDLINE ( January 1966 to December 2004 ) , EMBASE , CINAHL , LILACS and SCISEARCH ( all November 2004 ) .
other	We also searched individual trial collections and private databases , along with bibliographies of relevant articles .
other	Relevant medical journals were handsearched .
other	The most recent search was on February 6 , 2006 .
population	Randomised controlled trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo or heparin or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE .
other	We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug .
other	Two authors ( DB and WQ ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data .
outcome	Results were similar between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin in terms of : a ) death rate : odds ratio ( OR ) 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.45 to 1.78 ; b ) recurrence of pulmonary embolism : OR 0.63 ; 95 % CI 0.33 to 1.20 ; c )
outcome	We can not conclude whether thrombolytic therapy is better than heparin for pulmonary embolism based on the limited evidence found .
outcome	More double-blind RCTs , with subgroup analysis of patients presenting with haemodynamically stable acute pulmonary embolism compared to those patients with a haemodynamic unstable condition , are required .

background	Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .
background	In this study we examine factors involved in the regulation of inflammation and risk of CRC .
population	Data from a multi-center case-control study of colon ( N = 1579 cases and N = 1977 controls ) and rectal ( N = 794 cases and N = 1005 controls ) cancer were used to evaluate the association between the rs1800795 and rs1800796 IL6 polymorphisms and CRC .
other	We evaluated the joint effects of IL6 single nucleotide polymorphisms and regular use of aspirin/NSAIDs and vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) genotype .
outcome	Having a C allele of the rs1800796 IL6 polymorphisms and the GG genotype of the rs1800795 IL6 polymorphisms was associated with a statistically significantly reduced the risk of colon ( OR 0.76 95 % CI 0.57 , 1.00 ) , but not rectal ( OR 1.49 95 % CI 1.02,2.16 )
outcome	Both IL6 polymorphisms were associated with significant interaction with current use of aspirin/NSAIDs to alter risk of colon cancer : individuals with a C allele in either polymorphism who were current users of aspirin/NSAIDs had the lowest colon cancer r
outcome	CRC risk also was associated with an interaction between VDR and IL6 genotypes that was modified by current use of aspirin/NSAIDs .
outcome	This study provides further support for inflammation-related factors in the etiology of CRC .
outcome	Other studies are needed to explore other genes in this and other inflammation-related pathways .

background	This study investigated the outcome of anterior decompression and stabilization for `` unstable '' burst fractures without initial neurologic deficits in the thoracolumbar spine .
background	To determine the pain and work status of the patients , who underwent the anterior decompression and stabilization , to evaluate the relationship between residual back pain and the degree of kyphosis , and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of surge
population	A retrospective review was conducted on 45 patients with unstable burst fractures in the thoracolumbar spine treated by anterior decompression and stabilization in our institutions from 1982 to 1993 .
other	Nineteen patients were available for this study .
other	Ten patients were men and 9 were women .
other	Their age at surgery ranged from 15 to 76 years ( average , 46 years ) .
other	The duration of follow-up ranged from 24 to 84 months ( average follow-up , 54 months ) .
other	All clinical charts and radiologic data of these patients were reviewed by the first author .
other	Their pain , work , and employment statuses were assessed by the scales proposed by Denis in 1984 .
outcome	Nine patients were rated P1 , 7 were rated P2 , 2 were rated P3 , 1 was rated P5 , 11 were rated W1 , 3 were W2 , 1 was W3 , and 4 were rated W5 .
outcome	Even the physical laborers ' return to work averaged 5 months after surgery ( range , 3-12 months ) .
outcome	The postoperative kyphotic angle ranged from -6 degrees to 45 degrees ( average , 11 degrees ) , and it remained -5 degrees to 45 degrees ( average , 12 degrees ) at final follow-up .
outcome	There was no statistical correlation between the kyphotic angle and the pain scale .
outcome	Anterior decompression and stabilization for unstable burst fracture without initial neurologic deficits in the thoracolumbar spine has some advantages in the view of anatomical reduction and rigid stability that allows patients an early rehabilitation , r

background	To determine the incidence , duration and symptoms associated with acute confusion/delirium among traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) neuro-rehabilitation admissions .
study design	Prospective evaluation of neurobehavioural impairments following TBI among inpatient neurorehabilitation admissions .
population	Eighty-five consecutive TBI model system patients were evaluated using measures of orientation , cognition , motor restlessness and delirium .
other	Fifty-nine individuals met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- Fourth Edition Delirium Diagnostic Criteria ( DDC ) on initial evaluation and 42 of these resolved delirium during inpatient rehabilitation .
other	Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed significant unique associations of the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test ( GOAT ) , Delirium Rating Scale , Cognitive Test for Delirium and time elapsed since injury with DDC status .
outcome	Findings indicate that delirium is common among neuro-rehabilitation admissions with TBI .
outcome	Use of a single measure ( e.g. GOAT ) will result in poor characterization of the multi-faceted symptom complex shown by patients with post-traumatic confusion .

###11255596
background	Three meta-analyses have recently been reported on the relationship between choice of resuscitation fluid and risk of mortality in critically ill patients .
outcome	The relative risk of death ( 1.16-1 .19 ) in two of the meta-analyses was slightly higher in colloid than crystalloid recipients ; however , this observation was not statistically significant .
outcome	In the third meta-analysis , 6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 3-9 % ) pooled excess mortality was documented in patients receiving albumin for hypovolaemia , burns or hypoalbuminaemia .
outcome	The mortality difference in hypovolaemia patients ( 4 % ; 95 % CI , 0-8 % ) was not statistically significant .
outcome	A variety of serious limitations apply to the three meta-analyses , suggesting that their findings be interpreted cautiously .
outcome	More than one-half of the randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) included in the meta-analyses were reported prior to 1990 and hence do not reflect current practice .
outcome	Each meta-analysis included only a subset of relevant RCTs , and therefore the scope of inferences to be drawn from the meta-analytic results is limited .
other	The meta-analyses combined RCTs that were notably heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics , type of illness , administered fluids and physiologic endpoints .
other	Differences in illness severity , concomitant therapies and fluid management approaches were not taken into account .
other	Very few of the RCTs were blinded .
outcome	The meta-analyses do not support the conclusion that choice of resuscitation fluid is a major determinant of mortality in critically ill patients , nor do they support changes to current fluid management practice .
outcome	Changes such as exclusive reliance on crystalloids would necessitate a reassessment of the goals and methods of fluid therapy .
outcome	Since the effect on mortality may be minimal or non-existent , choice of resuscitation fluid should rest on whether the particular fluid permits the intensive care unit to provide better patient care .

background	We have recently demonstrated that following a moderate contusion spinal cord injury ( SCI ) to rats , subsequent administration of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) significantly enhances functional recovery and tissue sparing .
background	To further characterize the effects of bFGF , we evaluated its efficacy after a more severe contusion injury at T ( 10 ) using the NYU impactor .
intervention	Immediately after SCI , osmotic minipumps were implanted into the lateral ventricle and lumbar thecal sac to deliver bFGF at 3 or 6 microg per day versus control vehicle for 1 week .
other	Animals were behaviorally tested for 6 weeks before histological assessment of tissue sparing through the injured segment and glial reactivity distal to the lesion .
outcome	Compared to moderate SCI , all rats had more prolonged and sustained functional deficits 6 weeks after severe contusion .
outcome	Subjects treated with bFGF had pronounced recovery of hindlimb movements from 2 to 6 weeks compared to controls , manifested in significantly higher behavioral scores .
outcome	Only marginal tissue sparing was seen rostral to the injury in bFGF-treated spinal cords versus controls .
outcome	Optical density measurements of astrocyte and microglial cell immunoreactivity in bFGF-treated spinal cords showed that after 6 weeks they approximated controls , although astrocyte immunoreactivity remained higher in controls rostrally .
outcome	In summary , intrathecal infusion of bFGF following severe SCI significantly restores gross hindlimb motor function that is not correlated with significant tissue sparing .
outcome	In light of previous evidence that pharmacological intervention with bFGF after moderate SCI enhances tissue preservation , the current findings indicate that yet undefined mechanisms contribute to the enhanced functional recovery following bFGF treatment .

background	Acute urinary retention ( AUR ) is characterized by the sudden inability to urinate , which is usually extremely painful and requires catheterization .
background	Prostaglandins play an important role in the genitourinary function as they provoke contractions of the detrusor muscle .
background	Relaxation of the detrusor muscle , via the inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis , could result in AUR .
intervention	We conducted a population-based case-control study within the Integrated Primary Care Information project in the Netherlands to investigate whether the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) is associated with an increased risk of AUR .
population	All men 45 years or older registered in the database between 1995 and 2002 and with at least 6 months of valid history were included .
other	Cases were all men with a validated diagnosis of AUR .
other	To each case , up to 10 controls were matched on age and calendar time .
outcome	Within the source population of 72 114 men , we identified 536 cases of AUR and 5348 matched controls .
outcome	Risk of AUR was 2.02-fold higher in current users of NSAIDs than in nonusers ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.23-3 .31 ) .
outcome	The highest risk for AUR ( adjusted odds ratio , 3.3 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.2-9 .2 ) was observed in patients who recently started using NSAIDs and in those using a dose equal to or higher than the recommended daily dose .
outcome	This study shows that the risk of AUR is about 2-fold higher in men who use NSAIDs .

background	Dialysis patients have an inordinate risk of cardiovascular events .
background	Fish oils , rich in n-3 fatty acids , are believed to be beneficial in the prevention of atherosclerosis and thrombosis .
background	Hence , the use of fish oils deserves consideration as a preventative or therapeutic intervention in dialysis patients .
background	The suggestion has been made that n-3 fatty acids could increase the risk of bleeding , and thus , the safety of the use of these agents in dialysis patients must be established before long-term studies are undertaken .
background	This study addresses the effect of n-3 fatty acids on the hemostatic profile of dialysis patients .
population	Sixteen patients on chronic dialysis therapy were randomized to fish oil ( MaxEPA ) or placebo ( olive oil ) in a double-blind cross-over study .
intervention	They received 3.6 g of n-3 fatty acids for 4 wk .
outcome	Bleeding times were 4.8 + / - 0.4 min on MaxEPA and 4.5 + / - 0.3 min on placebo .
outcome	Platelet aggregation to low-dose ADP or collagen also remained unchanged .
outcome	There was a trend to lower serum triglyceride levels ( 2.7 + / - 0.5 versus 3.4 + / - 0.6 mmol/L , fish oil versus placebo ) that did not reach statistical significance .
outcome	Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 10 of the 16 subjects and were severe in 5 patients .
outcome	These side effects occurred in both the olive oil and the fish oil groups .
outcome	The study had a 95 % chance of detecting a clinically doubling significant increase in bleeding time , i.e. , beta error less than 5 % .
outcome	In conclusion , n-3 fatty acids do not introduce a clinically important risk of bleeding for patients with end-stage renal disease .

other	To evaluate the result of rehabilitation on motor and functional improvement in spinal tuberculosis .
study design	Prospective case study .
population	Data were collected from 47 patients with spinal tuberculosis medically and/or surgically treated , and rehabilitated over 6 months of period , after spinal decompression and fusion .
other	The main outcome measures were motor development of the patients who were evaluated at the beginning , in the 1st week , in the 3rd month , and in the 6th month .
other	Functional development of the patients was evaluated at the beginning and in the 6th month .
other	Functional assessment was made according to Modified Barthel Index ( MBI ) , and motor examination was made according to American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) .
outcome	The study population consisted of 47 patients ( 22 males and 25 females ) mean aged 37.9 + / - 18.3 years ( range 5-76 years ) .
outcome	The most common site of spinal tuberculosis was the thoracic region .
outcome	Localized back pain , paraparesis , sensory dysfunction and fever were typical clinical manifestations .
outcome	Surgical management was performed as anterior or posterior drainage of abscess and/or stabilization of the spine .
outcome	The rehabilitation program was performed in all patients during the preoperative , early postoperative and late postoperative 6 month periods .
outcome	Muscle-strengthening exercises on necessary localization such as pectoral , abdominal , lower extremities ; truncal and sacrospinal extensors were started for the rehabilitation .
outcome	The motor score for the lower limbs and the MBI scores for activities of daily living ( ADL ) and mobility improved significantly ( P < 0.001 ) .
outcome	The self-care and mobility categories of the MBI on admission ; were 14.8 % severely dependent and 10.6 % independent .
outcome	However , at the end of the rehabilitation program , 4.2 % were severely dependent and 70.2 % independent .
outcome	Early diagnosis and appropriate medical and/or surgical treatment together with a rehabilitation program will improve the life quality of patients with spinal tuberculosis .

background	Neuroendocrine tumours of the colon and rectum are rare but distinct with regard to clinical symptoms , diagnostic and therapeutic management and prognosis compared to other neuroendocrine tumours of the gut as well as ordinary colorectal cancer .
background	Therapeutic algorithms are proposed depending mainly on analogous TNM categories and grading considering conventional and experimental surgical and non-surgical therapy .
background	Colonic neuroendocrine tumours are often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and are therefore not properly treated with adjuvant and additive chemotherapy .
background	As most rectal neuroendocrine tumours are benign because of submucosal extension only , the size and infiltration depth correlates with lymph-node and distant metastases and therefore with the prognosis .
background	It is unknown whether endoscopic ultrasound can improve the diagnostic accuracy compared to size-related conclusions , and therefore whether it can change therapeutic strategies and improve survival by modern rectal surgery .

###15484665
background	Progress in the care of people with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) spans every aspect , from research in neuroregeneration to pharmacologic interventions .
intervention	This article focuses on advances in rehabilitation interventions , which have employed bioengineering , computerization , and advanced therapeutic techniques .
background	These interventions are being applied to functional deficits of the bladder , bowel , upper extremities , and respiratory system , as well as to improvements in ambulation and mobility .
background	Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) is being used to augment the function of the lower extremities , the upper extremities ( Freehand System ) , and the bowel and bladder ( Vocare System ) .
background	Tendon transfer is a reconstructive technique used to improve upper extremity function ; it is sometimes combined with FES .
background	Body weight-supported treadmill training is being used to improve ambulation in people with incomplete SCI , and advances in wheelchair technology are expanding options for mobility .
background	Cushion design and pressure mapping are modalities being used to reduce the high risk for pressure ulcers in the SCI population .
background	Research on shoulder stressors is being applied to transfer techniques , exercise regimens , adaptive equipment and wheelchair mechanics to minimize shoulder pain , another common complication .
outcome	The effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions needs to be documented by evidence-based research .
outcome	Researchers are focusing on the identification of outcomes measures that will form the basis for established standards of care for individuals with SCI .
outcome	Perhaps the combination of conventional and newer therapies may enhance neurological recovery .
outcome	Well-designed studies are needed before we can make this determination .

background	Perineural invasion is a histologic feature usually diagnostic of invasion in malignancies .
background	In the breast , however , it has been associated with benign lesions such as sclerosing adenosis ( SA ) , complex sclerosing lesion/radial scar ( CSL/RS ) , and ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) .
other	This article describes perineural invasion associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH ) , florid hyperplasia without atypia ( FH ) , and DCIS .
population	All cases with a diagnosis of perineural invasion were selected from a series of 10,000 breast consult cases .
other	Invasive mammary carcinomas were excluded .
outcome	Fourteen cases of perineural invasion were found and associated with the following diagnoses : ADH ( 5 ) , DCIS ( 3 ) , FH ( 5 ) , and ductal adenoma ( 1 ) .
outcome	Nine cases developed in CSL/RS , 4 cases in SA , and 1 case in a previous biopsy site of ductal adenoma ; lesions were all less than 3 mm .
outcome	The glands involving nerves showed cytologic and architectural features of the adjacent ADH , DCIS , and FH .
outcome	Immunostaining for protein gene product ( PGP ) 9.5 marked nerves , and smooth muscle actin antibody highlighted the myoepithelial cells around glands .
outcome	Perineural invasion seen in association with DCIS and ADH , in a background of CSL/RS and SA , may pose difficulty in diagnosis , especially in small biopsy specimens .
outcome	It should be assessed with care to avoid misinterpretation as invasive mammary carcinoma .

###16341623
background	Health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) is an important consideration in the management of patients with vertebral fractures .
other	The purpose of this study was to examine patient-related factors that contribute to HRQL after vertebral fractures , including co-morbidities , medications , fracture history , family disease history , demographics , exercise , education and living environment .
population	A total of 1,129 post-menopausal women ( mean age 67.2 , SD 11.9 years ) was studied from the Canadian Database of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia ( CANDOO ) .
other	HRQL was measured using the mini-osteoporosis quality of life questionnaire ( mini-OQLQ ) .
other	Separate multivariable linear regression analyses [ parameter estimates and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) ] were performed for each of the five mini-OQLQ domains symptoms , physical functioning , emotional functioning , activities of daily living and leisure domains .
outcome	A strong positive association was found between HRQL and post-secondary education , a family history of osteoporosis , working and thiazide therapy .
outcome	Exercise improved HRQL ; however , several hours a week were required to be meaningful .
outcome	Living in long-term care had the most marked negative effect on HRQL .
outcome	Smoking , past surgery of the hip or spine , sedatives , anticonvulsants , atherosclerotic disease and hypertension were also associated with a substantially decreased HRQL across several domains .
outcome	Calcium channel-blockers , chemotherapy , corticosteroids , diabetes , migraines , the number of non-vertebral fractures and falls had a negative impact on selected domains .
outcome	We demonstrated that several modifiable factors influence HRQL in patients with vertebral fractures , and physicians should be aware of these and other markers of reduced HRQL to enhance patient care .

###18327351
background	Around two-thirds of people with incurable diseases in economically developed countries wish to die at home , but less than one-third succeed in doing so .
background	Developing primary care-based services for the dying in the community is essential to reach and serve the whole population .
background	Three typical `` trajectories '' or patterns of decline in the last year ( s ) of life have recently been described , and each of these may require different models of care to best meet the needs of patients .
background	The palliative care approach must be urgently extended to patients with non-malignant conditions who have comparable concerns to and in some cases even greater and more prolonged unmet needs than cancer patients .
background	Primary care professionals have the potential and ability to provide end-of-life care for most patients , given adequate training , resources and access to care facilities and specialist advice when needed .
background	They are ideally placed to identify patients at diagnosis , hospital discharge or disease progression who might benefit from an early palliative care approach .
background	In the UK , Australia and US , some important initiatives are gaining momentum to facilitate the delivery of primary palliative services .
background	In Singapore , the involvement of family physicians in end-of-life care is very low .
background	A local survey is currently being conducted to identify the challenges in getting more family physicians involved .
outcome	Given adequate time and resources , community professionals throughout the world can provide effective , equitable , and accessible primary palliative care , and form a solid bridge of communication and support between primary and secondary care .

background	To assess impairments , disabilities and handicap pattern in konzo .
population	The study included 17 konzo subjects , of which three were males and 14 females ( mean age 21 , median 18 years ) .
intervention	A detailed neurological examination was performed on all subjects .
other	Subsequently , an assessment of impairments , disabilities and handicap was done with a constructed rating scale partially based on the ICIDH-2 framework .
outcome	The overall disablement picture in all subjects consisted of motor dysfunction in lower limbs leading to limitations in walking and movement activities , and restrictions in mobility .
outcome	Hip mobility was severely impaired in most cases ( 15/17 ) .
outcome	Although konzo subjects showed normal muscle power in upper limbs ( 13/17 ) , they had impaired fine motor function ( 10/17 ) .
outcome	Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of the WHO criteria for konzo in defining its forms .
outcome	The applicability of the ICIDH-2 framework in this study demonstrates the possibility of its use as a common language among researchers in the field of motor disorders .
outcome	However , a revision is suggested of its taxonomy , and a definition of operational criteria to clarify the content of different qualifiers provided to assess the level of functioning or disability .

###12514454
background	To develop and establish the psychometric properties of a pain treatment willingness scale and identify factors associated with willingness to try specific pain treatments for spinal cord injury ( SCI ) - related pain .
other	As part of a larger study , a questionnaire was designed to assess willingness to use various pain medications and other types of pain treatments .
population	This questionnaire , which included measures of pain severity , pain interference , mood , hope , and current use of pain treatments , was completed by persons with SCI recruited through the mail or in person .
other	One hundred fifteen persons completed the questionnaire ( 35 % response rate ) .
other	Seventy-two percent of the participants were men , mean age was 49.1 years , and average time elapsed since injury was 8 years .
outcome	Factor analysis indicated two factors-willingness to use opioids and willingness to use nonpharmacological treatment ( i.e. , physical therapy , relaxation methods and stress management , and alternative medicine ) .
outcome	Internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity were established .
outcome	Persons experiencing SCI-related pain were more willing to use pain treatments than those without current pain , and those who were currently using opioids reported greater willingness to use that treatment .
outcome	Persons who reported SCI-related pain were more willing to use nonpharmacological treatments than opioid medications .
outcome	Finally , participants demonstrated different degrees of willingness to use an opioid medication based on its name ( i.e. , `` narcotic , '' `` codeine , '' `` morphine , '' `` methadone '' ) .
outcome	Willingness to use a specific pain treatment may be a key factor mediating the behavior of using that specific treatment .
outcome	Assessment of patient attitudes toward various treatments options , particularly regarding opioid medications , is warranted to optimize treatment adherence .
outcome	Once the factors that determine these attitudes are identified , interventions to increase willingness to use nonpharmacological or opioid treatments can be designed and evaluated .

background	To examine the relation between leisure-time physical activity and ovarian cancer .
study design	We used data from a population based case-control study .
population	Cases ( n = 767 ) were women 20-69 years of age in whom epithelial ovarian cancer was diagnosed during 1994-1998 and who resided in a defined region of Pennsylvania , New Jersey , or Delaware .
population	Controls ( n = 1367 ) were ascertained by using random-digit dialing and Health Care Financing Administration files and were frequency-matched to cases for age and county of residence .
other	Information on lifetime leisure-time physical activity was obtained during in-person interviews .
outcome	Leisure-time physical activity was significantly associated with reduced occurrence of ovarian cancer ( P = .01 ) .
outcome	After adjustment for age , parity , oral contraceptive use , tubal ligation , family history of ovarian cancer , race , and body mass index , women with the highest level of activity had an odds ratio of 0.73 ( 95 % CI 0.56 , 0.94 ) for ovarian cancer compared with
outcome	When the relation was analyzed by various recalled time periods during life , the odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest category of activity at ages 14-17 , 18-21 , 22-29 , 30-39 , 40-49 , and > 50 years ranged from 0.64-0 .78 .

background	To describe potential therapeutic uses of calcitonin in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis .
intervention	Parenterally and intranasally administered calcitonin ( eel , salmon or human ) .
outcome	Fracture , fracture pain and loss of bone mineral density in osteoporosis ; increased bone mass , prevention of fractures , reduction of pain and improved quality of life associated with calcitonin treatment .
other	Relevant clinical studies and reports were examined , with an emphasis on recent randomized , placebo-controlled trials .
other	In vitro and in vivo studies of osteoclast activity were also considered .
other	Reducing fractures and fracture pain , increasing bone mineral density and minimizing side effects of treatment were given a high value .
outcome	Calcitonin reduces acute pain associated with osteoporotic fractures and has been found useful in treating chronic back pain following vertebral fractures in spinal osteoporosis .
outcome	It can prevent bone loss and may be effective in preventing fractures .
outcome	Side effects are dose related and generally mild ; they include gastrointestinal , vascular and dermatologic conditions that can be treated symptomatically or by varying the dosage .
outcome	Side effects are much rarer with nasal administration than with injection .
outcome	True allergic reactions are rare .
outcome	Calcitonin in both intramuscular and intranasal forms can reduce the pain of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures and may be effective in treating that associated with chronic vertebral osteoporotic fractures .
outcome	Calcitonin may also prevent postmenopausal bone loss and increase bone density in those with established osteoporosis .
outcome	Current evidence for long-term prevention of fractures is limited and does not support the use of calcitonin as a first-line treatment for established osteoporosis .
outcome	Most side effects can be avoided with nasal administration .
outcome	Further trials are needed to assess fracture prevention and effective dose ranges for treating pain and increasing bone mineral density and to determine the long-term efficacy of calcitonin in secondary osteoporosis , in premenopausal women , in men and in

background	Individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) represent a population with extreme inactivity .
background	The purpose of the current research was to investigate the metabolic differences between extremely inactive disabled individuals ( SCI sedentary group ) , active disabled individuals ( SCI athletes ) , and able-bodied individuals .
other	Fasting morning blood samples were obtained for the determination of high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDLc ) subfractions , glucose , and insulin .
other	The sedentary SCI group was comprised of 77 consecutive male admissions to a rehabilitation center .
other	The 17 SCI athletes were recruited prior to competition at the annual National Wheelchair Games .
outcome	Total HDLc and both its subfractions were significantly lower ( P less than 0.01 ) in the male SCI sedentary population than in the SCI athletes or able-bodied controls .
outcome	HDL2 was significantly elevated ( P less than 0.01 ) in the SCI athlete compared to the SCI sedentary group ( 42.7 vs 34.1 mg X dl-1 ) and was similar to the control population ( 46.1 mg X dl-1 ) .
outcome	Glucose levels were similar in the two SCI groups but were both significantly lower ( P less than 0.05 ) than in the able-bodied controls .
outcome	These data suggest that the extreme inactivity observed in disabled populations is associated with lower HDLc concentrations and presumably an increase in coronary heart disease risk if these values were to persist over time .
outcome	Additionally , it appears that physical activity is associated with increases in total HDLc , primarily through the HDL2 subfraction .
outcome	Glucose and insulin were similar for both SCI groups despite the marked difference in activity levels , suggesting that these parameters may not be associated with activity .

population	The self-awareness of brain injured patients in an acute inpatient rehabilitation programme was measured using the Functional Self-Appraisal Scale ( FSAS ) , which compares patient and staff ratings of patient performance on tasks relevant for acute rehabili
outcome	There was a significant difference between patients ' and staffs ratings near admission , consistent with previous findings in post-acute settings that brain injured patients tend to overestimate their abilities relative to other raters .
outcome	Patient and staff ratings tended to converge at time of discharge , likely reflecting patients ' improvements on rehabilitation tasks rather than increased self-awareness .
outcome	The average difference between patients ' and staffs ratings did not correlate with neuropsychological functioning on admission , supporting evidence that self-awareness early in the recovery process is a unique construct .
outcome	Future research is outlined , including investigating the relationship of early levels of self-awareness following TBI to functional outcome .

background	Five patients ( 4 women ) with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and primary major psychiatric disorder ( PMPD ) meeting DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder ( BAD ) were studied .
other	Four patients had early onset PD .
outcome	Four developed a severe psychiatric disorder a few years after starting dopaminergic therapy in presence of a mild motor disability and a mild cognitive impairment , with no evidence of cerebral atrophy at CT or MRI .
outcome	Two patients developed a clear manic episode ; the other three presented a severe depressive episode ( in one case featuring a Cotard syndrome ) .
outcome	None showed previous signs of long term L-dopa treatment syndrome ( LTS ) , hallucinosis or other minor psychiatric disorders .
outcome	The two manic episodes occurred shortly after an increase of dopaminergic therapy and in one case rapid cyclic mood fluctuations were observed .
outcome	At the onset of psychiatric symptoms , all patients had an unspecific diagnosis of chronic delusional hallucinatory psychosis ( CDHP ) .

background	Studies assessing the clinical and economic benefits of vaccination in the elderly have used different clinical outcomes ( e.g. hospitalizations for pneumonia or influenza versus hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular causes ) and different out
population	We explored the implications of these varying approaches by comparing two health economic analysis models of influenza vaccination of community-dwelling elderly persons .
other	We developed computerized models using clinical data from 3 large US HMOs for the 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 influenza seasons .
outcome	The primary health economic model used a broad definition of clinical events and outcome period and included hospitalizations for all respiratory and cardiovascular events that occurred during the entire influenza season .
outcome	The alternative model used more restrictive definitions and included pneumonia or influenza hospitalizations occurring during the peak influenza season .
outcome	The results of Monte Carlo simulation showed that , with the more inclusive primary model , influenza vaccination resulted in net medical care cost savings due to fewer respiratory or cardiovascular hospitalizations of Dollars 71/person vaccinated ( 5th-95th
outcome	In contrast , the alternate model found costs of Dollars 3.50 / person vaccinated ( 5th-95th percentile Dollars -11 to 5 ) and net costs of Dollars 91/year of life saved ( 5th-95th percentile Dollars -309 to 126 ) .
outcome	Our findings confirm that influenza vaccination of the elderly is most likely cost saving and supports policies and programs that advocate routine immunization of all persons 65 and older .
outcome	They also highlight how different outcome definitions can influence the results of health economic analyses .

population	Descriptive and retrospective study about 45 adults treated by rehabilitation .
other	A data sheet listed the patient 's occupation , current practice of sport , antecedents ( violent sport , traumatism , pain ) , presence of a family form , motive of consultation , clinical and paraclinical examinations and immediate and long-term results of rehabilitation .
outcome	Average age 35 years ( 18 to 65 ) , male predominance ( 1.8:1 ) , occupational risk factors : 16 % ; only 24 % practiced sports currently .
outcome	Antecedents : sports 49 % , spinal column traumatism 13 % , dorsal and lumbar pain during adolescence 16 % .
outcome	Consultation motive : abnormal posture 4 % and pain 96 % .
outcome	According to the examination : abnormal spinal column in 80 % of cases .
outcome	According to radiography , our patients were divided into 49 % who were carriers of growth vertebral dystrophy and 51 % who were carriers of the real Scheuermann 's disease .
outcome	The immediate results of rehabilitation were satisfactory , 75 % of the results were very good and good .
outcome	Between six months and four years , 70 % of the results were very satisfactory .
outcome	Exercises were observed in only 11 % of the cases , and stopped after two months on average .
outcome	Scheuermann 's disease in adults is a different entity from that of the teenager for the major manifestation is pain and not aesthetic quality .
outcome	The patient 's occupation is rather sedentary ; sport is beneficial .
outcome	The functional rehabilitation is the basic treatment and recourse to surgery or dorso-lumbar braces is rare .

population	Serum concentrations of testosterone , 4-androstene-3 ,17 - dione ( androstenedione ) , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHA ) and its sulphate and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) were measured in 30 ovulatory women before and after down-regulation with gonadotrophin
outcome	Nine of the women developed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) while the others did not .
outcome	Pretreatment values of androstenedione and the androstenedione : DHA ratios were higher and the testosterone : androstenedione ratios lower in the OHSS women .
outcome	The decrease in androstenedione levels during down-regulation was greater and the absolute levels following down-regulation were lower in the OHSS group .
outcome	Higher levels of SHBG and lower testosterone : SHBG ratios , an index of biologically active testosterone , were observed in the OHSS group .
outcome	The isolated elevation in pretreatment androstenedione levels and the high SHBG levels make the OHSS group different from patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
outcome	Pretreatment values of testosterone : androstenedione or testosterone/SHBG : androstenedione ratios and/or the decrease in androstenedione during down-regulation may be used as markers , prior to stimulation , for identifying women at risk of developing OHSS .

population	Twenty-four tenorrhaphies were performed at the mid-metatarsal region in 12 crossbred calves under xylazine-ketamine spinal analgesia .
intervention	A 2.5-cm long gap was created in the superficial digital flexor ( SDF ) tendon and immediately repaired with carbon fibres in the animals of group I and with plasma-preserved tendon allografts in group II .
outcome	Clinical examination revealed a slight increase ( P > 0.05 ) in rectal temperature , heart and respiratory rate for 2-4 days postoperation in both groups .
outcome	Milder pain and exudation as well as earlier restoration of tendon gliding movements and weight bearing were observed in group I as compared to group II .
outcome	Air-tendogram in the carbon fibre group on day 30 revealed restoration of continuity across the defect of the tendon .
outcome	whereas , in the allograft group , a dense homogeneous swelling was seen along the flexors .
outcome	Regression of peritendinous adhesions and swelling at the reconstructed site at later stages was seen in both groups .
outcome	Angiography showed hypervascularization at the reconstructed site on day 14 in the carbon fibre group , however , in the allograft group the site appeared to be relatively avascular .
outcome	On days 30 and 90 , blood vessels were normally organized in both groups .

background	Recent studies have suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI 's ) , prescribed for the relief of depression , can cause sexual dysfunction in up to fifty percent of those taking them .
background	The SSRI 's -- including fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , sertraline ( Zoloft ) , and paroxetine ( Paxil ) -- affect mood stabilization by promoting the transmission of the neurotransmitter serotonin , although enhancing serotonergic function can decrease libido or lead to erec
background	As an alternative to lowering antidepressant dosages and risking losing therapeutic gains , administering serotonin-blockers , such as cyproheptadine ( Periactin ) and yohimbine ( Yocon ) , has been shown to restore sexual function .
background	However , the serotonin antagonist , cyproheptadine , causes sedation and can reverse the antidepressant or anti-obsessive effect of the SSRI .
background	Yohimbine enhances transmission of the neurotransmitter epinephrine , increasing the flow of blood to erectile tissue and stimulating sexual desire by activating the cerebral cortex .
background	Its drawbacks are increased levels of panic attacks and higher required dosages .
background	Other potential biochemical stratagems are : amantadine ( Symmetrel ) , bromcriptine ( Parlodel ) , and buspirone ( Buspar ) , which enhance dopamine and serotonin transmission ; and bethanecol ( Urechline ) , which enhances choline transmission .
background	One study indicates improved sexual response when the nonserotonergic , mildly dopamine-enhancing buproprion ( Welbutrin ) is substituted for fluoxetine .

background	To assess whether losses in physical functioning are related to the natural menopause , hysterectomy , or calendar time during midlife , after adjustment for body size and smoking .
population	A longitudinal assessment of physical functioning was conducted from 2000/01 through 2005/06 in a population-based sample of 544 women at midlife enrolled in the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study .
other	Longitudinal mixed models were used to relate menopausal status to measures of physical functioning .
other	Perception of physical functioning was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 questionnaire .
intervention	Eight performance-based measures of physical functioning were also included .
outcome	Women with hysterectomy ( with or without estrogen from ovarian conservation or exogenous replacement ) had reduced levels of functioning and greater rates of change in the 2-lb lift ( P < .005 ) , sit-to-stand ( P < .01 ) , timed stair climb ( P < .01 ) , timed
outcome	Diminished functioning in postmenopausal women was observed in hand grip ( P < .005 ) , 2-lb lift ( P < .05 ) , sit-to-stand ( P < .05 ) , velocity ( P < .05 ) , and perceived physical functioning ( P < .05 ) .
outcome	Based on regression analyses , there was greater loss in women with hysterectomy compared with natural menopause .
outcome	Level of functioning among postmenopausal women with exogenous hormone replacement was similar to premenopausal women on eight of nine physical functioning measures .
outcome	Hysterectomy , even with availability of an estrogen source , seems to be a `` risk '' state for diminishing physical function at midlife , and this may initiate a vulnerable stage for future compromised quality of life .

other	Review of relevant literature .
population	A 53-year-old patient with an incomplete C2 tetrapareses ( ASIA B ) developed severe and painful muscle spasms together with respiratory failure and autonomic dysreflexia .
intervention	Spasmolytic treatment was started .
outcome	After the first admission of 5 mg of oral Baclofen , he collapsed in bed with extreme bradycardia , hypotension , hyperventilation and decreased oxygen saturation .
outcome	A second dosage of 5 mg Baclofen resulted in the same complications .
outcome	After implantation of a pacemaker , restarting oral Baclofen induced a pacemaker rhythm with episode of hypotension and respiratory failure and also a delirium .
other	Intrathecal Baclofen also resulted in a pacemaker rhythm with hypotension and a decreased cardiac output .
outcome	To our knowledge , this is the first time a severe heart conduction problem was induced in a spinal cord injury patient after a single therapeutic dose of Baclofen .
outcome	In this case therapeutic oral Baclofen has caused serious cardiac conduction problems .

background	The purpose of this study was to assess factors that affect the quality of performance and interpretation of sonography of adnexal masses .
population	Two gynecologic sonographers performed blinded reviews of up to 3 sonograms within 5 years before surgery in 325 consecutive women who underwent oophorectomy ( 610 sonograms ) .
other	Three 5-point quality scores were assigned ( with 5 being the best score ) on the basis of the technical quality of the images , accurate description of findings , and summary impression in the report .
other	The location of the examination ( on-site , remote , or emergency department ) , type of fellowship , practice experience ( < 5 , 5-10 , or > 10 years ) , and specialty ( women 's imaging , abdominal imaging , or other ) of the radiologists were recorded .
other	Analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of these multiple factors on quality .
outcome	No significant differences were found among 31 radiologists on the basis of the type of training , years in practice , or number of examinations read .
outcome	Average scores among radiologists for technical quality , findings , and impressions were 4.96 , 4.88 , and 4.83 , respectively .
outcome	Radiologists who specialized in women 's imaging performed best in the quality of their impressions ( 4.86 versus 4.79 ; P = .029 ) .
outcome	There were no significant differences in scores with respect to the examination location .
outcome	Within this sample of radiologists , the technical quality of the examinations was not affected by the type of training or subspecialty practice .
outcome	Reports of adnexal mass findings were accurately described by all radiologists , although specialization in women 's imaging improved the ability to provide an accurate impression .

background	Central pain is a particular form of neuropathic pain .
background	Due to lesions in the spinothalamocortical pathways , ectopic neuronal discharges can occur into different neurons of the spinal cord and brain .
background	Functional MRI , and positron emission tomography might be able to visualize ongoing pain activity which is , sometimes the consequence of spinothalamocortical lesions .
background	Sometimes the patient experiences a burning ice-like sensation .
background	This is more frequent in spinal cord lesions than in brain injuries .
background	Some adrenergic , gabergic neurotransmitters , glycine , prostanoids and glutamate may play a role in pain transmission .
background	These transmitters can induce changes in the neuronal membrane potential .
background	Consequently , amitriptyline as an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor and the sodium channel blockers are the drugs of first-choice .
intervention	A test procedure with placebo , opioids , lignocaine , propofol and ketamine might give some insight into advanced drug treatment .
background	If oral or transdermal drug delivery is not indicated or ineffective , the intrathecal administration route can be attempted with baclofen , clonidine , opioids and midazolam .
background	Invasive electrostimulation is the last treatment option .
background	Thalamic stimulation can be tried in spinal cord injuries , and sensory motor cortex stimulation is sometimes the last resort for brain lesions associated with pain .

###11092158
background	Health disparities among racial and ethnic groups have a long history and continue to exist in the United States .
background	The U.S. government has established as a goal for the year 2010 the elimination of racial/ethnic health differences in six areas .
background	This article examines disparities in one of those areas : access to high-quality health care .
background	Several measures of access to and use of health care services are studied both nationally and in 13 diverse states .
outcome	The authors find that both the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparity and the reasons behind it depend significantly on the state , the ethnic group , and the type of outcome measure being studied .
outcome	Such information can be valuable for state and national policy makers in targeting resources and in designing effective strategies for the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities .

###12969780
background	This study determined whether maternal glucose tolerance has a progressive effect on the length of gestation in singleton pregnancies and whether there is an increasing tendency towards spontaneous preterm birth with increasing glucose intolerance .
population	A total of 2,168 consecutive Chinese women with singleton pregnancies who underwent the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) over a 24-month period were categorized by their OGTT 2-hour value ( mmol/L ) into the following six groups : 5.9 or less , 6.0-6 .9
other	Women with a 2-hour glucose value of 8.0 or more mmol/L were considered to have gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) and received diet treatment .
other	Women who eventually required insulin were excluded from the final analysis .
other	The mean gestational age , birth weight , incidence of preterm birth , large for gestational age ( LGA , birth weight > 90th percentile ) , and macrosomic ( birth weight > or = 4.0 kg ) infants were compared among the six groups .
outcome	The incidence of preterm birth correlated significantly with increasing glucose intolerance .
outcome	On further analysis , incidence of spontaneous birth before 37 weeks in the lowest to the highest 2-hour value groups was as follows : 5.5 % , 2.6 % , 3.7 % , 4.9 % , 8.5 % , and 10.3 % ( P = .015 ) and that before 32 weeks went from 0.4 % , 0.3 % , 0.8 % , 0.4 % , 2.2 % , to 3.4 %
outcome	There was no significant difference in the incidence of LGA or macrosomic infants .
outcome	Regression analysis confirmed that the OGTT 2-hour glucose value was an independent determinant of gestational length .
outcome	Gestational glucose intolerance affects gestation length and incidence of preterm birth , which should be considered a confounding factor in the analysis of the neonatal outcome of GDM pregnancies .

###1642528
population	Three hundred and twenty-six persons with light , moderate , or severe diffuse traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) were assessed during initial hospitalization in Johannesburg .
other	One hundred and forty-four were followed up at approximately six months , 83 at 12 months , and 71 at 24 months posttrauma .
other	The sample attrition rate was high .
other	When patients could not be found , data were obtained from their caregivers .
other	Recovery was measured in five different areas of functioning family relationships , psychologic problems , activities of daily living ( ADL ) , employment status , and physical status .
outcome	Psychologic problems and family relationships worsened with time , but proficiency in ADL improved ; physical and employment status remained relatively stable during the survey period .
outcome	Severity of injury was significantly correlated with outcome in each functional area at some point in the follow-up period .
outcome	Discrepancies between patients ' and caregivers ' perceptions of outcome were noted , particularly in the area of psychologic functioning .
outcome	Caregivers tended to rate the recovery made by the patient as better than the outcome patients perceived themselves to have made .
outcome	These differences in perception diminished with time .
outcome	The multifactorial nature of recovery after TBI is indicated by the improvements seen in some functional areas and the worsening of outcome in other areas .
outcome	These findings suggest that rehabilitation programs for persons with TBI should ( 1 ) include caregivers , ( 2 ) focus on the adjustment of both parties to their new circumstances , and ( 3 ) facilitate a convergence in their perceptions .
outcome	Adequately defining recovery is a first step to estimating the prevalence of TBI , but necessitates further work .
outcome	Epidemiology awaits a better understanding of the recovery process after TBI .

background	An 18-yr-old boy presented with extreme back pain as the result of multiple vertebral fractures .
background	At age 16 he had developed a tumor of the mesencephalon .
other	A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was established surgically .
background	One year later , he developed progressive neurologic deficits in his upper and lower limbs with an increase in the size of the tumor .
background	He was treated by irradiation and high doses of glucocorticoids .
background	Although the neurologic deficits progressively improved , he developed severe back pain resulting in complete immobilization for 3 mo in spite of neurologic recovery .
background	Multiple vertebral fractures were diagnosed by X-ray .
background	Bone density was extremely low ( Z-score of -5.5 in the spine and -3.1 in the femoral neck ) .
intervention	The patient was treated with calcium and vitamin D , calcitonin , bisphosphonates , physiotherapy , and progressive mobilization .
intervention	Glucocorticoids were decreased and could be stopped as the neurologic deficits fully recovered .
outcome	After 1 yr of treatment with intermittent i.v. pamidronate , bone density had increased by 40 % in the spine and by 25 % in the femoral neck despite growth arrest .
outcome	He progressively recovered from back pain and is now , at age 20 , fully ambulant , studying mechanical engineering , without neurologic sequelaes and free of glucocorticoids .
outcome	Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor had disappeared .
outcome	This case proves that treatment of symptomatic glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis during puberty can be rewarding , even when multiple and invalidating vertebral fractures already exist .

background	Cervical cancer is a disease of middle-aged and elderly but still there are young women diagnosed with advanced disease that is incurable with local treatment and is treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy .
background	It is unknown whether these young patients have a poorer outcome compared to older patients or whether elderly patients have inferior outcome than younger patients when treated with combination chemotherapy .
population	We compared the outcome between young ( < 35 ) , elderly ( > 70 ) and middle-aged ( 35-70 ) women who were treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy for advanced , recurrent or persistent disease .
other	Two hundred and eighteen patients were included in our database .
outcome	The baseline clinical and disease characteristics were not different between age groups but anemia and thrombocytosis were more frequent in younger patients .
outcome	Median survival for all patients was 13.4 ( 95 % CI 11-15 .8 ) months while survival of patients < 35 years of age was 9 months ( 95 % CI 5.8-12 ) , of patients older than 70 was 10 months ( 95 % CI 6.9-13 ) of patients 35 to 70 years of age was 14.5 months ( 95 % CI
outcome	Multiple factors were significant for survival in univariate analysis but only weight loss , pain score and relapse inside an irradiated filed were significant predictors of outcome in multivariate analysis .
outcome	Very young ( < 35 ) and elderly ( > 70 ) patients have a worse prognosis after treatment with combination chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent cervical cancer .
outcome	Nevertheless , this difference is not significant when adjusted for other prognostic factors .

background	We examined affective and cognitive components of body image related to physical appearance , weight , and health among 120 university men and women of three racial/ethnic groups : African American , European American , and Latino/a American .
other	Participants completed a Background Information Sheet , the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire ( MBSRQ ) , the Body-Esteem Scale ( BES ) with additional items , and the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding ( BIDR ) .
other	We tested for effects of race/ethnicity and gender on the body image measures while controlling for age , body size , social desirability , and socioeconomic status ( SES ) .
outcome	African Americans reported greatest body satisfaction and least overestimation of weight .
outcome	Latino/a Americans were equal to or higher than European Americans on all indices .
outcome	Gender differences occurred on global body image , weight concerns , fitness , and health .
outcome	There were no Gender x Race/Ethnicity interactions .
outcome	This pattern of racial/ethnic and gender differences shows a need for exploring a wider range of culturally relevant body image dimensions .

background	To evaluate the radiological spectrum of sequelae of corrosive acid and alkali injury to the upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract using barium contrast examination .
population	Barium contrast radiographic films of 155 patients with a history of corrosive ingestion , acid in 120 and alkali in 35 patients with grade 2b and 3 injury on initial endoscopy , were retrospectively evaluated .
intervention	Barium contrast examination of the upper GI tract was performed in the course of follow-up , beyond 3 weeks of corrosive ingestion .
outcome	The esophagus was involved in 131 patients and the stomach in 74 .
outcome	Fifty patients had simultaneous involvement of esophagus and stomach .
outcome	Radiological findings in the esophagus were solitary or multiple strictures of varying length , intramural pseudodiverticula , and carcinoma in long-standing corrosive injury .
outcome	The stomach showed cicatrization , predominantly involving the antrum , linitis plastica type deformity with multiple pseudodiverticula .
outcome	There was no difference in the radiological findings as to the type of corrosive ingested .
outcome	Barium examination of the upper GI tract is useful in the evaluation of late sequelae of corrosive injury ( acid/alkali ) .
outcome	There was no difference in the radiological findings as to the type of corrosive ingested .
outcome	Thus , contrary to general belief , we found that acid and alkali damage both the esophagus and the stomach with equal degree of severity .

population	A retrospective review of all patients undergoing PVP was conducted to identify patients who also received long-term corticosteroid therapy .
other	Outcomes including pain , periprocedural complications , and frequency of new fractures in patients receiving corticosteroids were compared with control patients undergoing PVP for primary osteoporosis .
outcome	Sixty-eight patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy underwent 79 PVP procedures .
outcome	Patients treated with corticosteroids undergoing PVP were significantly younger and more likely to be male compared with control subjects .
outcome	Patients receiving long-term corticosteroid treatment experienced significant pain relief immediately postprocedure and at 1 week , 1 month , 6 months , 1 year and 2 years postprocedure ( P < .0001 at all time points ) .
outcome	Patients receiving corticosteroids experienced similar decreases in pain from baseline compared with control subjects at all follow-up time points ( P > .05 ) .
outcome	The complication rate for patients receiving corticosteroids was 4.4 % compared with 3.4 % for control subjects ( P = .60 ) .
outcome	Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment did not have an increased risk of new fractures after PVP compared with control subjects ( P = .68 ) .
outcome	Percutaneous vertebroplasty performed for vertebral compression fractures as a result of long-term corticosteroid therapy is as safe and effective in relieving pain as PVP performed in patients with vertebral compression fractures as a result of primary o

background	The aims of the present study were to investigate whether temporal summation of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex depends on the stimulation site on the sole of the human foot , and to characterize the reflex receptive fields ( RRF ) of lower limb muscles to
population	The cutaneous RRFs were assessed in 15 subjects in sitting position by recording the EMG from five lower leg muscles and the kinematic responses ( ankle , knee , and hip joints ) to repetitive painful electrical stimulation .
intervention	The stimulus consisted of a series of five stimuli ( frequency : 3 Hz ) delivered randomly at 10 different sites on the sole of the foot .
outcome	The size of the reflexes increased generally between the first and the second stimulus , however , the increment depended on the stimulation site .
outcome	In tibialis anterior , the RRF covered the distal sole of the foot and gradually expanded during the stimulus train .
outcome	No expansion toward the heel area was detected .
outcome	In soleus , the reflexes were facilitated after the second stimulus at all sites and remained in this state until the last stimulus .
outcome	In vastus lateralis , biceps femoris , and iliopsoas a gradual expansion of the RRF was seen , resulting in RRFs covering the lateral , distal foot , and part of the proximal foot ( iliopsoas ) .
outcome	Knee and hip flexion were evoked at all sites .
outcome	Ankle dorsiflexion was evoked at the distal foot , while ankle plantarflexion was evoked at the heel .
outcome	The enlargement of the RRF reflects spinal temporal summation leading to gradually stronger reflex responses .
outcome	The degree of temporal summation was dependent on stimulation site .
outcome	The facilitation of the withdrawal reflex responses due to repetitive stimulation might have potential applications in the rehabilitation engineering field , where these reflexes could be used to assist gait of patients with central nervous system injuries

background	Calcitonin has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and other diseases involving accelerated bone turnover for approximately 25 years .
background	The most commonly studied and prescribed form is salmon calcitonin , which has a greater efficacy in clinical use .
other	A wealth of well-controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that calcitonin preserves or increases bone mineral density ( BMD ) and reduces the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis .
background	Recent studies have indicated that while a low BMD is correlated with an increase in fracture risk , increases in BMD alone do not explain the antifracture efficacy of antiresorptive therapies such as calcitonin .
background	Therapies that moderately increase BMD may reduce fracture risk by reducing the rate of bone turnover and maintaining the integrity of the trabecular architecture , resulting in the preservation of bone strength and quality in osteoporotic patients .
background	An advantage of calcitonin that is not shared by other antiresorptive therapies is its direct analgesic effect on bone pain .
background	Calcitonin has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in improving pain , not only from the acute vertebral fractures of osteoporosis , but also in Paget 's disease , bone malignancies , and other sources of musculoskeletal pain .
background	Drugs containing calcitonin may be approved for additional indications in the near future , and as more convenient routes of administration such as the oral route become available , the demand for the calcitonin peptide is expected to increase .

study design	A prospective study was developed to quantify acute low back pain recovery .
other	To compare traditional self-report measures of low back pain recovery with a quantitative measure of recovery .
background	The magnitude of low back disorders in society continues to be a problem .
background	To prevent secondary injuries , an understanding of recovery must be gained by comparing the natural course of recovery using several outcome measures .
population	For this study , 16 occupational and 16 nonoccupational patients with low back pain were recruited .
other	Recovery was monitored prospectively every 2 weeks for 3 to 6 months , using subjective work status , pain symptoms , activities of daily living , and objective functional performance probability ( trunk kinematics ) .
outcome	Return to work underestimated the percentage of subjects impaired , as compared with all other outcome measures .
outcome	Symptoms , activities of daily living , and functional performance probability all showed similar patterns of recovery for 0 to 12 weeks .
outcome	At 14 weeks , there was a lag in functional performance recovery .
outcome	Both symptoms and activities of daily living indicated that 80 % of the population was recovered , whereas functional performance indicated the figure to be 68 % .
outcome	This prospective study demonstrates the natural course of recovery using several outcome measures .
outcome	The objective kinematic functional performance measure of recovery quantifies a different aspect of impairment not evaluated by traditional subjective measures .
outcome	Use of several outcome measures may lead to a better understanding of low back pain recovery or residual impairment , which may minimize the risk of recurrent injury .

background	The application of motor imagery practice in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a novel treatment approach for improving motor function .
other	The purpose of this study was to compare group treatment using a combination of physical and motor imagery practice with group treatment using only physical practice in subjects with PD .
population	Of 23 patients with idiopathic PD , 12 received combined therapy , whereas 11 received physical therapy alone .
other	Exercises for both groups were applied during 1-h sessions held twice a week for 12 weeks .
intervention	Comparable motor tasks provided to both groups included callisthenic exercises , functional tasks , and relaxation exercises .
intervention	However , the experimental group was treated with both imagery and real practice , whereas the control group received only physical exercises .
other	Outcome measures included the time required to complete sequences of movements , the performance of balance tasks , impairment and functional scores on the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , and specific cognitive abilities ( Stroop and clock drawing tests ) .
outcome	Following the intervention , the combined treatment group exhibited significantly faster performance of movement sequences than the control group .
outcome	In addition , the experimental subjects demonstrated higher gains in the mental and motor subsets of the UPDRS and in the cognitive tests .
outcome	Both groups improved on the activities of daily living scale .
outcome	The combination of motor imagery and real practice may be effective in the treatment of PD , especially for reducing bradykinesia .
outcome	The implementation of this treatment regimen allows for the extension of practice time with negligible risk and low cost .

background	Pediatric and adolescent athletes presenting with back pain are much more likely to have a pathologic cause for their symptoms than are adult patients .
background	For this reason , it is important for those caring for younger athletes to maintain a high index of suspicion for some of the more common pathologic causes of back pain in this population .
background	Diagnostic evaluation should be undertaken more quickly in pediatric and adolescent athletes .
background	Sports-related diagnoses that must be considered include disc-related back pain , atypical Scheuermann 's kyphosis , spondylolysis , and spondylolisthesis .
background	Patients of this age may also present with conditions not associated with activity , including discitis , classic Scheuermann 's disease , rheumatologic disease , and spinal tumors .
background	History and physical exam provide valuable information to help guide further diagnostic studies which , in turn , will determine necessary treatment .
background	No definitive studies are available regarding the diagnosis and treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis .

background	Prior to undergoing conservative pelvic surgery for improvement of fertility , there must be meticulous preoperative evaluation .
background	This evaluation involves a history , all previous records and operative reports , psychologic evaluation , physical examination , hysterosalpingogram , laparoscopy , and tests for male factor and ovulation .
outcome	In history taking , the physician is most interested in past evidence of infection .
outcome	The emotional status of the patient must be considered , especially for those individuals who are seeking sterilization reversal .
outcome	Often , with a history of previous pelvic surgery the rate of success is lowered .
outcome	Physical examination is usually not useful in predicting final outcome of microsurgery ; however , it does determine the patient 's general preoperative status .
outcome	Hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy are complementary procedures which are the cornerstone of the preoperative evaluation .
outcome	The 1st gives evidence of the status of the uterus and the tube proximal to the block , if 1 exists .
outcome	If the block is in the isthmic portion , the hysterosalpingogram will indicate how much of the tube is patent next to the corpus .
outcome	Preoperative laparoscopy is necessary for proper and complete evaluation of pelvic status ; it allows the operator to visualize the distal segment of the tube .
outcome	Laparoscopy indicates the extent of pelvic adhesion , ovary and tube involvement , mobility of the tube , extent of fimbrial involvement , and presence of disease .
outcome	When all factors are taken are into consideration , the surgeon must determine whether the benefits of surgery will outweigh the risks .

background	We compared reactivity of EEG to external stimuli -- an easily and quickly available measure -- with the central conduction time ( CCT ) of the somatosensory evoked potentials , currently the most-used electrophysiologic method to predict outcome in severe head
population	In 50 patients , comatose subsequent to SHI , we measured EEG reactivity and CCT within 48 to 72 hours and compared them with the outcome after 1.5 years .
outcome	Using discriminant analysis , EEG reactivity correctly classified 92 % , CCT classified 82 % , and both measures together classified 98 % of the patients into globally good or bad outcome groups .
outcome	GCS allowed a correct classification in only 72 % and , combined with either of the two electrophysiologic measures , did not further increase predictability .
outcome	EEG reactivity is an excellent long-term global outcome predictor in SHI , superior to CCT and GCS .
outcome	When the two electrophysiologic measures are combined , a prognostic accuracy is achieved that is better than that of any other reported method .

background	We evaluated the efficacy of physiotherapy , occupational therapy , and speech and language therapy in Parkinson 's disease by synthesizing six Cochrane systematic reviews .
intervention	All randomised , controlled trials examining the efficacy of a paramedical therapy versus control intervention and all those comparing the efficacy of two forms of active therapy in Parkinson 's disease were included .
other	Trials were identified by searching biomedical databases , reference lists , hand searching , and contacting investigators .
other	The main outcome measures were quality of life , speech intelligibility , activities of daily living , and individual measures of motor and speech impairment .
outcome	We identified 16 physiotherapy randomised controlled trials ( 399 patients ) , two occupational therapy trials ( 84 patients ) , and five speech and language therapy for dysarthria trials ( 154 patients ) .
outcome	None of these studies examined nonpharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia .
outcome	We were unable to perform meta-analysis of the results because the trials used heterogeneous therapy methods and outcome measures .
outcome	The trials also had marked methodological flaws that could have introduced bias .
outcome	In summary , we failed to find conclusive evidence of benefit for any form of paramedical therapy sufficient to recommend them in routine clinical practice .
outcome	However , this lack of evidence is not proof of a lack of effect .
outcome	Further large pragmatic randomised controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of paramedical therapies in Parkinson 's disease .

background	We investigated the relationship of neurologic , neuropsychological , and social interaction impairments to the work status of a large sample of penetrating head-injured patients wounded some 15 years earlier during combat in Vietnam .
other	Extensive standardized testing of neurologic , neuropsychological , and social functioning was done at follow-up on each head-injured patient ( N = 520 ) , as well as on a sample of uninjured controls ( N = 85 ) .
outcome	Fifty-six percent of the head-injured patients were working at follow-up compared with 82 % of the uninjured controls .
outcome	Seven systematically defined impairments proved to be most correlated with work status .
outcome	These were post-traumatic epilepsy , paresis , visual field loss , verbal memory loss , visual memory loss , psychological problems , and violent behavior .
outcome	These disabilities had a cumulative and nearly equipotent effect upon the likelihood of work .
outcome	We suggest that a simple summed score of the number of these seven disabilities can yield a residual `` disability score '' which may prove to be a practical tool for assessing the likelihood of return to work for patients in this population and per
outcome	These findings may also help to focus rehabilitation efforts on those disabilities most likely to affect return to work .

background	Dynorphin is a neuropeptide that is present in high quantities in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord .
background	The peptide is actively involved in pain processing pathways .
background	However , its involvement in spinal cord injury is not well known .
population	Alteration in dynorphin immunoreactivity occurs following a focal trauma to the rat spinal cord .
intervention	Infusion of dynorphin into the intrathecal space of the cord results in ischemia , cell damage and abnormal motor function .
intervention	Antibodies to dynorphin when injected into the intrathecal space of the spinal cord following trauma improve motor recovery , reduce edema and cell changes .
background	However , influence of dynorphin on trauma induced alteration in spinal cord bioelectrical activity is still not known .
background	Spinal cord evoked potentials ( SCEP ) are good indicator of spinal cord pathology following trauma .
background	Therefore , in present investigation , influence of dynorphin antibodies on trauma induced changes in SCEP were examined in our rat model .
background	In addition , spinal cord edema formation , microvascular permeability disturbances and cell injury were also investigated .
outcome	Our results show that topical application of dynorphin antiserum ( 1 : 200 ) two min before injury markedly attenuated the SCEP changes immediately after injury .
outcome	In the antiserum treated animals , a significant reduction in the microvascular permeability , edema formation and cell injury was observed in the traumatised spinal cord .

background	Injury to the spinal nerves of mice induces mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia .
outcome	In the injured spinal cord , the expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was increased , whereas it was decreased in N-type Ca ( 2 + ) - channel-deficient mice , in which neuropathic pain is eliminated .
outcome	Intrathecal and intraperitoneal injection of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 produced antinociceptive effects , whereas intracerebroventricular injection was without effect .
outcome	The more selective antagonist dexamethasone 21-mesylate suppressed both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia .
outcome	These results suggest that spinal glucocorticoid receptors play an important role in neuropathic pain , and that controlling the activity of glucocorticoid receptors may be of great importance in the treatment of neuropathic pain .

background	Acute low back pain with or without sciatica usually is self-limited and has no serious underlying pathology .
background	For most patients , reassurance , pain medications , and advice to stay active are sufficient .
background	A more thorough evaluation is required in selected patients with `` red flag '' findings associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome , cancer , infection , or fracture .
other	These patients also require closer follow-up and , in some cases , urgent referral to a surgeon .
other	In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain , imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks , which usually allows the pain to improve .
outcome	There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , skeletal muscle relaxants , heat therapy , physical therapy , and advice to stay active .
outcome	Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments .
outcome	Evidence for the benefit of acupuncture is conflicting , with higher-quality trials showing no benefit .
outcome	Patient education should focus on the natural history of the back pain , its overall good prognosis , and recommendations for effective treatments .

other	Primary efficacy measurements consisted of the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) and the Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) scale .
other	Secondary measurements included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety ( HAM-A ) , the Raskin Depression Scale , the Covi Anxiety Scale , and the Leeds Sleep Questionnaire .
other	Additionally , scores for two items and five factors from the HAM-D were analyzed .
other	Efficacy was based on 124 evaluable patients in each treatment group .
outcome	As measured by HAM-D and CGI-Severity scores , there was a significant ( p < .001 ) improvement from baseline to each follow-up visit in both treatment groups with no statistically significant difference between groups .
outcome	There was also no significant difference in the proportion of responders in each group .
outcome	CGI-Improvement responder rates were 69 % for sertraline and 67 % for fluoxetine .
outcome	Results of secondary efficacy measurements followed the same trend , although from the second week of treatment there was a numerical advantage ( not statistically significant ) for sertraline over fluoxetine in improving anxiety symptoms as measured by the
outcome	Headache and nausea were the most frequently reported events for both drugs .
outcome	The incidence of early patient withdrawals due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 14 % for sertraline and 13 % for fluoxetine .
outcome	The starting dosage ( sertraline 50 mg/day , fluoxetine 20 mg/day ) was the final dosage in 76 % of patients in both treatment groups .

outcome	A clear and statistically significant increase in the mean urinary metabolic ratio ( MR ) of dextromethorphan/dextrorphan and in the mean mephenytoin S/R ratio ( S/R ) was seen with the fluvoxamine and fluoxetine treatment .
outcome	The mean MR increased from 0.13 to 0.27 ( P < 0.01 ) with fluoxetine and from 0.34 to 0.84 with fluvoxamine ( P < 0.05 ) .
outcome	The ( dextromethorphan ) ` extensive metabolizer ' phenotype switched to the ` poor metabolizer ' phenotype in six patients by the 10-day fluoxetine treatment , and in two patients by the fluvoxamine treatment .
outcome	The mean S/R increased from 0.24 to 0.34 ( P < 0.05 ) with fluoxetine , and from 0.33 to 0.58 ( P < 0.002 ) with fluvoxamine .
outcome	These results are in agreement with the observed modification of TCA plasma levels after the SSRI association .
outcome	During fluvoxamine treatment , amitriptyline and clomipramine plasma levels ( P < 0.06 both ) tendentially increased , and those of demethylclomiprarnine decreased ( P < 0.06 ) .
outcome	Fluoxetine addition lead to a significant increase ( P < 0.02 ) of the desmethylclomipramine plasma levels .
outcome	Fluvoxamine induced a moderate augmentation of the plasma levels of haloperidol and its reduced metabolite and no change in the plasma levels of cyamemazine and levomepromazine .
outcome	But patients treated with neuroleptics are to few to draw any firm conclusion .
outcome	This study suggests , that fluoxetine and fluvoxamine differ in their interaction with the metabolism of some other basic psychotropic drugs , by a mechanism which implies CYP2D6 and CYPmeph and possibly other isoformes of cytochrome P-450 .
outcome	Moreover , the interactions produced varied with the TCA prescribed .

background	The communication impairments that characterize severe dementia make pain assessment challenging .
background	As such , pain problems often go undetected .
background	Our goal was to determine whether systematic pain assessment leads to improved pain management practices and decreases nursing stress in comparison with a control condition .
study design	We adopted a 3-month comparative longitudinal design .
population	Nursing staff regularly assessed dementia patients ' pain through the use of the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate ( PACSLAC ) .
population	A second group of nurses completed an attention-control measure for a control group of patients .
population	In addition , nursing staff regularly completed measures of work stress to investigate the effects of the workload associated with systematic pain assessment on nurse stress .
outcome	Regular use of the PACSLAC improved pain management practices over time as reflected in increased usage of analgesic medications ( prescribed on as needed basis ) in comparison with the control group .
outcome	As pain interventions increased , a corresponding decrease in observable pain behaviors ( as reflected on the PACSLAC assessments that were completed by the nurses ) was observed .
outcome	In addition , nurses who used the PACSLAC reported decreased distress and burnout over time .
outcome	This investigation provides strong support for both the importance of systematic pain assessment in long-term care and for the clinical utility of the PACSLAC in improving pain management practices and decreasing caregiver distress .

outcome	Among the 151 adnexal masses studied by both MRI and IC , respective sensitivities , specificities , positive and predictive values of both methods for the diagnosis of malignancy were 89.7 % and 84.5 % , 91.4 % and 100 % , 86.7 % and 100 % , and 93.4 % and 91.3 % .
other	Sensitivities of MR imaging and frozen section for the diagnosis of serous versus mucinous borderline tumors were 33.3 % and 93.3 % , and 62.5 % and 12.5 % , respectively .
outcome	MRI is less accurate than IC for characterizing adnexal masses .
outcome	However , MRI may increase the relevance of IC for borderline mucinous tumors .

background	The transient hyperemic response ( THR ) in the middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) after the release of brief compression of the ipsilateral common carotid artery has been used to study cerebral autoregulation .
background	We conducted the present study to evaluate the reliability of THR to detect changes in cerebral autoregulation induced by graded variations in PETCO2 .
population	Seven healthy adult volunteers were recruited .
intervention	Fifteen THR tests were performed on every volunteer : three at baseline PETCO2 , three each at PETCO2 of 7.5 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg above the baseline , and then three each at PETCO2 of 7.5 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg below the baseline .
outcome	Transient hyperemic response ratio ( THRR ) and strength of autoregulation ( SA ) were calculated using established formulae .
outcome	Both THRR and SA were highly sensitive ( 96 % ) in detecting the changes in cerebral autoregulation induced by graded changes in PETCO2 .
outcome	The within-individual variability of SA was significantly smaller than that of THRR at all levels of PETCO2 .
outcome	This study demonstrates the reliability of the THR test , when used for repetitive measurements , in detecting changes in cerebral autoregulation induced by graded changes in PETCO2 .
outcome	This test may provide a simple and noninvasive method of evaluating changes in cerebral autoregulation within an individual .

study design	A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted .
other	To determine the relation between degeneration of all the joints in the cervical spine , and to identify the effects of litigation on pain and disability levels in trauma and nontrauma patients .
background	The link between spinal degeneration and patient symptoms remains controversial .
background	Two recent similar studies present conflicting results concerning the association between spinal degeneration and symptomatology .
background	These two studies , performed in different countries , did not consider the impact of impending litigation on self-reported pain and disability levels .
background	The role of the uncovertebral and facet articulations has hitherto not been investigated .
population	Radiographic and questionnaire data from 180 consecutive patients with neck pain were collected .
other	Neck pain severity was measured using two time-dependent scales .
other	All patients completed the Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) and questions about chronicity , etiology , and associated litigation .
other	The radiographs were evaluated for the number of levels of degeneration and the severity of degeneration in the discs as well as the uncovertebral and facet articulations .
outcome	In this study , 71 patients ( 40.57 % ) reported neck pain as a result of injury .
outcome	However , only 5.1 % had associated litigation .
outcome	There was no statistically significant difference in pain severity or disability levels between the patients with and those without cervical degeneration .
outcome	According to the findings , the number of levels of cervical degeneration and the severity of degeneration in the discs , facets , and uncovertebral joints are not related to the levels of pain and disability .
outcome	Patients reporting neck pain caused by injury had a tendency ( P = 0.055 ) to more pain during the preceding week and significantly more disability ( P < 0.001 ) .
outcome	Significant differences included pain intensity ( P < 0.025 ) , reading ( P < 0.001 ) , headaches ( P < 0.025 ) , ability to drive ( P < 0.01 ) , and concentration ( P < 0.01 ) .
outcome	Women reported significantly more pain ( P < 0.01 ) and disability ( P < 0.001 ) than men , but did not have more degeneration in any of the joints .
outcome	In patients with neck pain , there is no difference in reported pain and disability levels between those with and those without evidence of cervical spine degeneration .
outcome	Patients whose neck pain is the result of trauma report significantly more pain and disability than nontrauma patients .
outcome	This is not because of more spinal degeneration or overriding litigation issues .

###16783255
background	To characterize the factors associated with the ` doctor ' effect in primary care , as reported in randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) .
other	A systematic search of Medline ( 1964-2004 ) sought to identify all original reports of RCTs , as well as those reported in reviews and metaanalyses .
other	We used the following key words RCT , doctor-patient relationship , doctor-patient communication , knowledge , skill , attitude , non-pharmacologic effectiveness , primary care .
outcome	Ten RCTs and one metaanalysis provided evidence that a combination of emotional and cognitive care has a consistently positive effect on health outcomes .
outcome	This effect relies on specific attitudes and skills : empathy , reassurance , explanation , counseling , influencing patients ' ` health beliefs and expectations , promoting change in behavior , thoughts or emotions .
outcome	These can be integrated into a specific patient-centered approach to general practice .
outcome	Medical education must provide training in the relational skills needed for effective treatment .
outcome	Qualitative and quantitative research , including RCTs , are necessary ; they should be designed to deal with the heterogenous situations and specific characteristics of general practice .

###16492098
background	One of the core propositions in most clinical and descriptive models of personality disorders ( PDs ) is that these conditions are stable over time .
background	However , the available empirical literature suggests that PDs are far less stable than these models imply .
population	The present study examines the 10-year stability of PDs in a sample of depressed outpatients who were assessed for the full range of Axis II conditions across 5 assessments .
other	Three primary issues are addressed ( a ) the stability of categorical PD diagnoses , ( b ) the relative stability of dimensional PD traits , and ( c ) the absolute stability of PD traits .
outcome	The stability of PD diagnoses was poor to fair , and the stability of dimensional PD traits was fair to moderate .
outcome	Growth curve analyses revealed complex patterns of change in absolute scores for PD traits across the 10-year interval .
outcome	Stability of PDs was generally comparable to that of anxiety disorder diagnoses and normal personality traits .

###16818834
background	To address the following questions : ( 1 ) What evidence ( ie , psychometric data collected in pediatric primary care , patient outcome data ) exists for the various methods used to identify adolescent depression in primary care ?
background	and ( 2 ) What identification practices are currently in use ?
other	We systematically searched MEDLINE for English-language articles using specific search terms and examined relevant titles , abstracts , and articles .
other	We reviewed 1743 MEDLINE abstracts .
other	Seventy-four articles were pulled for examination , with 30 articles meeting full criteria .
other	Five studies had adequate psychometric data on various adolescent depression identification methods in primary care .
other	Only 1 compared the diagnostic accuracy of physicians trained to ask depression questions vs physicians trained in the use of a diagnostic aid .
other	Six studies reported on current practice .
other	Evidence regarding sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value was sought for question 1 .
other	Frequency of screening was sought for question 2 .
outcome	Review of these articles found that few health care professionals use systematic depression identification methods , despite some growing evidence for their validity , feasibility , and possible efficacy .
outcome	Available evidence indicates that primary care professionals would improve their rates of depression diagnosis through training , but even more so by using adolescent symptom rating scales .

study design	A prospective and controlled study of perioperative use of combined local anesthetic and corticosteroid in lumbar disc surgery .
background	The anti-inflammatory mechanism of corticosteroids is considered to be caused by the inhibition of phospholipase A2 , which plays an important role in the pain mechanism of lumbar disc problems .
background	Although some authors have demonstrated that the use of intramuscular bupivacaine during lumbar discectomy resulted in a marked reduction of postoperative back pain , others have reported that the key intervention was probably the administration of epidura
background	The coadministration of these two drugs in lumbar disc surgery for the relief of postoperative back pain has yet not been studied adequately .
other	Assessment of the combined use of perioperative corticosteroids and bupivacaine for the relief of postoperative pain after lumbar disc surgery .
population	Forty-four selected patients had acute-onset single-level unilateral herniated nucleus pulposus that were refractory to conservative management .
intervention	All patients underwent lumbar disc surgery under standard general anesthesia .
intervention	Before surgical incision , the skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 10 mL of 1 % lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline to produce local vasoconstriction .
intervention	During wound closure , 20 mL 0.9 % saline in Group 1 ( n = 22 ) and 20 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine in Group 2 ( n = 22 ) were injected into the paravertebral muscles and subcutaneus tissues .
intervention	In addition , a piece of autologous fat taken from the wound was first soaked in 40 mg of methylprednisolone for 10 minutes , then placed over the exposed nerve root , and the remaining steroid was flushed into the wound in Group 2 .
other	The wound was closed after drug administration in both groups .
intervention	In the postoperative period , all patients received 100 mg of meperidine intramuscularly when needed and were allowed to receive a second dose at least 4 hours later than the first dose for postoperative analgesia .
other	Postoperative back pain intensity , heart rate , and mean arterial pressure were assessed 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 hours after the conclusion of surgery .
outcome	Visual analog scale pain scores for the postoperative recordings were lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 , but these findings were not statistically significant .
outcome	Patients in Group 1 received 77.3 + / - 48.8 mg meperidine , and those in Group 2 received 31.8 + / - 45.5 mg meperidine , for pain medication in the first 12 hours ( P < 0.05 ) .
outcome	Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were not significantly different between the two groups in all recording periods .
outcome	It is concluded that the perioperative use of bupivacaine and corticosteroids during lumbar discectomy maintains effective postoperative analgesia and decreases opioid usage without complications .

###17309715
background	Cervicogenic headache is a chronic hemicranial pain , usually occurring daily .
intervention	This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of nerve stimulator-guided occipital nerve blockade in the treatment of cervicogenic headache .
other	The reduction in analgesic consumption was the primary outcome measure .
population	Fifty adult patients diagnosed with cervicogenic headache were randomly divided into two equal groups of 25 patients each .
outcome	All patients in both groups received greater and lesser occipital blocks , whereas only 16 patients in each group received facial nerve blockade in association with the occipital blocks .
outcome	The control group received injections of an equivalent volume of preservative-free normal saline .
outcome	Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale ( VAS ) and the Total Pain Index ( TPI ) .
outcome	Forty-seven patients entered into the final analysis as three patients were lost to follow-up .
outcome	Anesthetic block was effective in reducing the VAS and the TPI by approximately 50 % from baseline values ( P = 0.0001 ) .
other	Analgesic consumption , duration of headache and its frequency , nausea , vomiting , photophobia , phonophobia , decreased appetite , and limitations in functional activities were significantly less in block group compared to control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
outcome	The nerve stimulator-guided occipital nerve blockade significantly relieved cervicogenic headache and associated symptoms at two weeks following injection .

background	To determine the feasibility of contrast-enhanced three-dimensional ( 3D ) imaging of the prostatic vasculature using power Doppler imaging and to analyze whether semiquantitative judgments of 3D images with respect to symmetry and distribution of vascular
intervention	3D power Doppler images were obtained before and after intravenous administration of 2.5 g Levovist .
intervention	Subsequently , random and/or directed transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) - guided biopsies were performed .
other	Vascular images were analyzed by two experts .
other	Prostate vasculature was judged with respect to symmetry and vessel distribution using a ( scale ) grading system .
population	Eighteen patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer either because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen ( greater than 4.0 ng/mL ; Tandem-R-assay ) or an abnormal digital rectal examination were included in the study .
outcome	Prostate cancer was detected in 13 patients .
outcome	Vascular anatomy was judged abnormal in unenhanced images in 6 cases , of which 5 proved malignant .
outcome	Enhanced images were considered suspicious for malignancy in 12 cases , including 1 benign and 11 malignant biopsy results .
outcome	Sensitivity of enhanced images was 85 % ( specificity 80 % ) compared with 38 % for unenhanced images ( specificity 80 % ) and 77 % for conventional gray-scale TRUS ( specificity 60 % ) .
outcome	Of 6 patients who showed no B-mode abnormalities , vascular patterns were judged abnormal in 4 cases , of which 3 were malignant .
outcome	Contrast-enhanced 3D power Doppler angiography is feasible in patients with suspicion of prostate cancer who are scheduled for prostate biopsies .
outcome	The sensitivity of power Doppler 3D imaging for the detection of prostate malignancy increased from 38 % ( 5 of 13 ) to 85 % ( 11 of 13 ) after administration of intravascular microbubble contrast ( Levovist ) , and specificity was found to be 80 % ( 4 of 5 ) for bot
outcome	Thus , the use of Levovist when combined with the power Doppler display mode and 3D image reconstruction offers a promising new research area that might prove useful in prostate cancer detection in the future .

background	We present a case of an 8-year-old girl with collapse of her T6 and T7 vertebrae secondary to chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis .
background	She presented with chronic abdominal pain and was found to have multiple bony lesions involving her spine , clavicle and mandible .
background	Extensive investigations , including tissue biopsy , were unable to identify an infective cause and there was no response to a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics .
outcome	She made a good response to regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication .

background	Anxiety disorders are common in general practice and are associated with several problems regarding recognition and management .
population	To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving recognition , diagnosis , and management of patients with anxiety disorders .
study design	DESIGN OF STUDY : Systematic review .
other	MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsychINFO , and the Cochrane Clinical Trials ' Register were searched up until 2003 .
other	Randomised controlled trials , controlled before/after trials , and interrupted time series for professional , organisational , financial , and regulatory interventions were eligible .
other	Primary effect measures consisted of anxiety outcomes , diagnosis , prescription , and referral .
other	Two reviewers independently made eligibility judgments eight out of 563 articles were found to be eligible .
other	Two reviewers participated independently in the quality assessment and data extraction process using a standardised form based on the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care checklist .
other	Relative risks or standardised mean differences were calculated when possible .
intervention	Four professional interventions and three organisational interventions were examined .
outcome	In general , the professional interventions seemed to increase recognition , referral , and prescription as well as improving anxiety outcomes .
outcome	Two out of three organisational interventions showed a positive effect on anxiety outcomes .
outcome	The one study that took prescription into account showed no effect .
outcome	The quality of care for patients with anxiety can be improved .
outcome	A combination of professional and organisational interventions in which an external expert is introduced seems to be most promising .
outcome	Additional research is nevertheless necessary to determine the exact effects of such interventions using patient effect measures , economic evaluations , and feasibility studies .

###18602860
background	Animal and epidemiological studies confirm an impact of the fatty-acid composition in the diet on cancer development .
population	We investigated the role of supplementation of the diet of female F344-rats with sunflower , rapeseed , olive or coconut oil on the formation of the promutagenic , exocyclic 1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct of the main lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2
other	This adduct is considered as the predominant DNA adduct arising from lipid peroxidation .
outcome	The correlations between adduct levels and the different fatty acids were not uniform for all organs .
outcome	No clear relationships between fatty acids and adduct levels were found in the colon .
outcome	Significant positive correlations were observed between linoleic acid , total polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) , vitamin E and DNA adduct levels in the small intestine and in the kidney .
outcome	The results indicate an increasing effect on cancer risk in these organs as a result of high intake of linoleic acid .
outcome	Inverse relationships between linoleic acid , PUFA and vitamin E intake and adduct levels were found in the glandular stomach and the lung .
outcome	We could not confirm a chemopreventive effect of linolenic acid ( C-18 omega-3 PUFA ) on the formation of adducts in our animal study , as was shown in white blood cells of women in a previous study .
outcome	A tendency towards a decrease in adduct levels was seen with monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ) in all organs except the lung .
outcome	Saturated fatty acids showed a significant positive correlation with adduct levels in the mucosa of the glandular stomach and a significant inverse correlation in the small intestine .
outcome	Saturated fatty acids are not considered to directly influence lipid peroxidation to a major extent .

background	Older individuals with TBI differ from younger adults with TBI in several ways , including their incidence rates , etiology of injury , nature of complications , lengths of hospitalization , functional outcomes , and mortality .
background	Despite the greater likelihood of poorer functional outcomes , older adults with TBI often achieve good functional outcomes and can live in community settings after receiving appropriate rehabilitation services , although at higher costs and longer hospital
outcome	The future of rehabilitation care for elderly patients after TBI is uncertain due to financial limitations associated with the implementation of the PPS payment system by CMS .
outcome	Little is known regarding the long-term impact of TBI on individuals as they age , but this is an important issue as the population ages .

###15712978
background	Percutaneous vertebral body injection procedures currently are used to stabilize and reinforce weakened or fractured bone resulting from metastatic disease and severe osteoporosis .
background	Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can reinforce the structure of a vertebral body and provide pain relief , but the procedures have technical differences .
background	Kyphoplasty improves vertebral height to varying degrees in nearly three quarters of patients .
background	Kyphosis is improved more effectively when the procedure is performed within 3 months from the onset of fracture pain .
background	To date , it is unknown whether vertebroplasty with preprocedure postural reduction can provide similar improvement of deformity .
outcome	Complications are relatively infrequent with both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty .
outcome	Cement leakage from the vertebral body is more likely with vertebroplasty than with kyphoplasty .
outcome	Leakage is more common in the treatment of pathologic fractures resulting from metastatic disease .
outcome	Clinical complications caused by cement leakage and neural compression are infrequent .
outcome	Specific indications for these injection procedures need to be more clearly refined .
outcome	Long-term outcomes , including the fate of the injected material and the effect on adjacent vertebrae , have yet to be determined .

###17478048
background	Growing evidence supports a role for the immune system in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain .
background	ATP is a key neurotransmitter in this process .
background	Recent studies demonstrate that the glial ATP receptor , P2X7 , contributes to the modulation of pathological pain .
other	To further delineate the endogenous mechanisms that are involved in P2X7-related antinociception , we utilized a selective P2X7 receptor antagonist , A-438079 , in a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments .
population	Injection of A-438079 ( 10-300 micromol/kg , i.p. ) was anti-allodynic in three different rat models of neuropathic pain and it attenuated formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors .
outcome	Using in vivo electrophysiology , A-438079 ( 80 micromol/kg , i.v. ) reduced noxious and innocuous evoked activity of different classes of spinal neurons ( low threshold , nociceptive specific , wide dynamic range ) in neuropathic rats .
outcome	The effects of A-438079 on evoked firing were diminished or absent in sham rats .
outcome	Spontaneous activity of all classes of spinal neurons was also significantly reduced by A-438079 in neuropathic but not sham rats .
outcome	In vitro , A-438079 ( 1 microM ) blocked agonist-induced ( 2,3-O - ( 4-benzoylbenzoyl ) - ATP , 30 microM ) current in non-neuronal cells taken from the vicinity of the dorsal root ganglia .
outcome	Furthermore , A-438079 dose-dependently ( 0.3-3 microM ) decreased the quantity of the cytokine , interleukin-1beta , released from peripheral macrophages .
outcome	Thus , ATP , acting through the P2X7 receptor , exerts a wide-ranging influence on spinal neuronal activity following a chronic injury .
outcome	Antagonism of the P2X7 receptor can in turn modulate central sensitization and produce antinociception in animal models of pathological pain .
outcome	These effects are likely mediated through immuno-neural interactions that affect the release of endogenous cytokines .

background	To contrast single and double balloon-inflated kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs ) and evaluate its clinical efficacy .
population	From May 2000 to May 2004 , 90 consecutive procedures were performed in 58 patients who suffered from painful vertebral compression fractures , transferring tumour and angioma .
other	Ninety vertebrae were inflated while 62 as A group were double balloon and 28 as B group were single balloon , fracture reduction and bone cement augmentation .
other	Preoperative and postoperative symptom levels , variables , complications were recorded and the vertebral height and Cobb angle were measured and analyzed .
outcome	All patients ' pain was alleviated or disappeared without syndrome , and the vertebral height and Cobb angle of both groups were improved .
outcome	The average recovery rate was 72.6 % ( 22.9 % approximately 100 % ) , Cobb angle from 17.9 degrees ( 3.1 degrees approximately 31.6 degrees ) were corrected to 9.6 degrees ( 0.6 degrees approximately 28.2 degrees ) , the average angle was 8.7 degrees ( 0.3 degrees
outcome	The average recovery rate of A group was 77.6 % ( 55.3 % approximately 100 % ) , B group was 64.3 % ( 22.9 % approximately 100 % ) .
outcome	The average postoperative Cobb angle of A group was 9.9 degrees ( 0.3 degrees approximately 27.2 degrees ) , B group was 8.6 degrees ( 0.6 degrees approximately 19.8 degrees ) ( P > 0.05 ) .
outcome	As a promising minimally invasive surgery , balloon kyphoplasty can provide early relief of pain and improve the function as well as spinal alignment in treatment of painful compression fracture owing to recovering the vertebral height and Cobb angle of th
outcome	Single balloon-inflated kyphoplasty can improve VCFs as double balloon .

background	The main aims of this paper are to describe the setting and design of a Minimal Intervention in general practice for Stress-related mental disorders in patients on Sick leave ( MISS ) , as well as to ascertain the study complies with the requirements for a c
background	The potential adverse consequences of sick leave due to Stress-related Mental Disorders ( SMDs ) are extensive , but often not recognised .
background	Since most people having SMDs with sick leave consult their general practitioner ( GP ) at an early stage , a tailored intervention given by GPs is justified .
background	We provide a detailed description of the MISS ; that is more accurate assessment , education , advice and monitoring to treat SMDs in patients on sick leave .
other	Our hypothesis is that the MISS will be more effective compared to the usual care , in reducing days of sick leave of these patients .
study design	The design is a pragmatic RCT .
population	Randomisation is at the level of GPs .
intervention	They received the MISS-training versus no training , in order to compare the MISS vs. usual care at patient level .
other	Enrollment of patients took place after screening in the source population , that comprised 20-60 year old primary care attendees .
other	Inclusion criteria were moderately elevated distress levels , having a paid job and sick leave for no longer than three months .
other	There is a one year follow up .
other	The primary outcome measure is lasting full return to work .
other	Reduction of SMD - symptoms is one of the secondary outcome measures .
other	Forty-six GPs and 433 patients agreed to participate .
outcome	In our study design , attention is given to the practical application of the requirements for a pragmatic trial .
outcome	The results of this cluster RCT will add to the evidence about treatment options in general practice for SMDs in patients on sick leave , and might contribute to a new and appropriate guideline .
outcome	These results will be available at the end of 2006 .

###11405487
background	To investigate whether left atrial appendage outflow velocity alone or in relation to left atrial diameter is a superior predictor of sinus rhythm maintenance after cardioversion compared with traditional clinical or echocardiography parameters .
population	Sixty-two patients with their first episode of atrial fibrillation were examined using echocardiography before DC-cardioversion .
other	At one month 's follow-up , 42 patients had maintained sinus rhythm ( group A ) , and 20 had relapsed into atrial fibrillation ( group B ) .
other	There were no differences in arrhythmia duration or antiarrhythmic therapy between the groups .
outcome	Left atrial diameter measured by echocardiography was smaller in group A ( 42 mm , 95 % CI 40.9-44 .1 mm ) compared with group B ( 46 mm , 95 % CI 43.4-48 .2 , p < 0.05 ) .
outcome	Patients in group A had a higher left atrial appendage outflow velocity at 0.44 m/s ( 95 % CI 0.39-0 .49 ) compared with 0.34 m/s ( 95 % CI 0.30-0 .37 ) in group B ( p < 0.01 ) .
outcome	The ratio of left atrial appendage flow to left atrial diameter was 0.011 ( 95 % CI 0.009-0 .012 ) in group A compared with 0.008 ( 95 % CI 0.007-0 .009 ) in group B , and 63 % ( 95 % CI 33-78 ) of the patients in group A had velocity ratio > 0.009 compared with 20 % ( 9
outcome	Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a velocity ratio > 0.009 was the only predictor for maintenance of sinus rhythm one month after cardioversion with an odds ratio of 6.4 ( 95 % CI 1.9-23 .8 ) , ( p = 0.004 ) .
outcome	The ratio of left atrial appendage outflow velocity to left atrial diameter is superior to the traditionally used criteria for prediction of maintenance of sinus rhythm following DC-conversion of first-episode atrial fibrillation .

background	A chronic minor imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure may lead to obesity .
background	Both lean and obese subjects eventually reach energy balance and their body weight regulation implies that the adipose tissue mass is `` sensed '' , leading to appropriate responses of energy intake and energy expenditure .
background	The cloning of the ob gene and the identification of its encoded protein , leptin , have provided a system signaling the amount of adipose energy stores to the brain .
background	Leptin , a hormone secreted by fat cells , acts in rodents via hypothalamic receptors to inhibit feeding and increase thermogenesis .
background	A feedback regulatory loop with three distinct steps has been identified : ( 1 ) a sensor ( leptin production by adipose cells ) monitors the size of the adipose tissue mass ; ( 2 ) hypothalamic centers receive and integrate the intensity of the leptin signal thr
background	While this feedback regulatory loop is well established in rodents , there are many unsolved questions about its applicability to body weight regulation in humans .
background	The rate of leptin production is related to adiposity , but a large portion of the interindividual variability in plasma leptin concentration is independent of body fatness .
background	Gender is an important factor determining plasma leptin , with women having markedly higher leptin concentrations than men for any given degree of fat mass .
background	The ob mRNA expression is also upregulated by glucocorticoids , whereas stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in its inhibition .
background	Furthermore , leptin is not a satiety factor in humans because changes in food intake do not induce short-term increases in plasma leptin levels .
background	After its binding to LRb in the hypothalamus , leptin stimulates a specific signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of several orexigenic neuropeptides , while stimulating several anorexigenic peptides .
background	The orexigenic neuropeptides that are downregulated by leptin are NPY ( neuropeptide Y ) , MCH ( melanin-concentrating hormone ) , orexins , and AGRP ( agouti-related peptide ) .
background	The anorexigenic neuropeptides that are upregulated by leptin are alpha-MSH ( alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ) , which acts on MC4R ( melanocortin-4 receptor ) ; CART ( cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript ) ; and CRH ( corticotropin-releasing-hormone
background	Obese humans have high plasma leptin concentrations related to the size of adipose tissue , but this elevated leptin signal does not induce the expected responses ( i.e. , a reduction in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure ) .
background	This suggests that obese humans are resistant to the effects of endogenous leptin .
background	This resistance is also shown by the lack of effect of exogenous leptin administration to induce weight loss in obese patients .
background	The mechanisms that may account for leptin resistance in human obesity include a limitation of the blood-brain-barrier transport system for leptin and an inhibition of the leptin signaling pathways in leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons .
background	During periods of energy deficit , the fall in leptin plasma levels exceeds the rate at which fat stores are decreased .
background	Reduction of the leptin signal induces several neuroendocrine responses that tend to limit weight loss , such as hunger , food-seeking behavior , and suppression of plasma thyroid hormone levels .
background	Conversely , it is unlikely that leptin has evolved to prevent obesity when plenty of palatable foods are available because the elevated plasma leptin levels resulting from the increased adipose tissue mass do not prevent the development of obesity .
outcome	In conclusion , in humans , the leptin signaling system appears to be mainly involved in maintenance of adequate energy stores for survival during periods of energy deficit .
outcome	Its role in the etiology of human obesity is only demonstrated in the very rare situations of absence of the leptin signal ( mutations of the leptin gene or of the leptin receptor gene ) , which produces an internal perception of starvation and results in a

background	Previous studies have shown that spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) of upper lumbar segments decreases visceromotor responses to mechanical stimuli in a sensitized rat colon and reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in patients .
background	SCS applied to the upper cervical spinal dorsal column reduces pain of chronic refractory angina .
background	Further , chemical stimulation of C1-C2 propriospinal neurons in rats modulates the responses of lumbosacral spinal neurons to colorectal distension .
other	The present study was designed to compare the effects of upper cervical and lumbar SCS on activity of lumbosacral neurons receiving noxious colorectal input .
population	Extracellular potentials of L6-S2 spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized , paralyzed and ventilated male rats .
intervention	SCS ( 50 Hz , 0.2 ms ) at low intensity ( 90 % of motor threshold ) was applied to the dorsal column of upper cervical ( C1-C2 ) or upper lumbar ( L2-L3 ) ipsilateral spinal segments .
other	Colorectal distension ( CRD , 20 mmHg , 40 mmHg , 60 mmHg , 20s ) was produced by air inflation of a latex balloon .
outcome	Results showed that SCS applied to L2-L3 and C1-C2 segments significantly reduced the excitatory responses to noxious CRD from 417.6 + / -68.0 to 296.3 + / -53.6 imp ( P < 0.05 , n = 24 ) and from 336.2 + / -64.5 to 225.0 + / -73.3 imp ( P < 0.05 , n = 18 ) , respectively .
outcome	Effects of L2-L3 and C1-C2 SCS lasted 10.2 + / -1.9 and 8.0 + / -0.9 min after offset of CRD .
outcome	Effects of SCS were observed on spinal neurons with either high or low-threshold excitatory responses to CRD .
outcome	However , L2-L3 or C1-C2 SCS did not significantly affect inhibitory neuronal responses to CRD .
outcome	C1-C2 SCS-induced effects were abolished by cutting the C7-C8 dorsal column but not by spinal transection at cervicomedullary junction .
outcome	These data demonstrated that upper cervical or lumbar SCS modulated responses of lumbosacral spinal neurons to noxious mechanical stimulation of the colon , thereby , proved two loci for a potential therapeutic effect of SCS in patients with irritable bowel

population	In a prospective randomised study with a 2-year follow-up , 103 patients were randomised to anterior cervical decompression and fusion ( ACDF ) with a cervical carbon-fibre intervertebral fusion cage ( CIFC ) or the Cloward procedure ( CP ) .
background	The purpose of the present study was to report predictors for fusion and also to investigate the importance of radiological variables for the clinical outcome .
other	Gender , age , smoking habits , disc height , segmental kyphosis and type of surgical procedure were used as independent ( before surgery ) variables in a multiple regression model .
other	Male gender , one-level surgery and CP treatment were significant predictors of fusion and explained 14 % of the variability of fusion status at follow-up .
other	Number of levels operated on , however , did not influence the clinical outcome .
outcome	Fifty-two per cent of the women and 17 % of the men in the CIFC group , and 25 % of the women and 8 % of the men in the CP group , had pseudarthrosis .
outcome	Although patients with a healed fusion had significantly less pain intensity than patients with pseudarthrosis , radiological variables explained only 4 % of the variability of pain at follow-up .
outcome	Apart from a significant correlation between preoperative kyphosis and neck disability index at follow-up , no significant correlation between either postoperative kyphosis or preoperative or postoperative disc height and clinical outcome was found .
outcome	Neither degree of segmental kyphosis nor disc height was different between patients with healed fusion and pseudarthrosis .
outcome	One can conclude that male gender and type of surgery were significant predictors for a healed fusion and that pseudarthrosis affected outcome .
outcome	In contrast to the commonly held view based mainly on theoretical considerations , no effect on clinical outcome could be demonstrated for segmental kyphosis and disc height at follow-up .
outcome	Overall , the study shows that the importance of radiological factors as predictors for fusion as well as clinical outcome is limited .

background	Treatment of human alpha-linolenic acid deficiency ( ALAD ) with ethyl linolenate is reported .
population	The patient 's scaly dermatitis nearly disappeared after 5-d supplementation with 0.1 mL ethyl linolenate .
outcome	Pretreatment content of various n-3 fatty acids in RBC was 0-15 % of healthy controls .
outcome	After 14 d of supplementation , cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced by 70 % of pretreatment values , 22:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3 increased three - to fourfold while 18:3 n-3 and 20:5 n-3 remained low , indicating a rapid elongation and desaturation of 18:3 n-3 in
outcome	Urinary excretion of PGI2-M was approximately 10 times higher than in healthy control subjects , while PGI3-M excretion was low .
outcome	Linolenate supplementation increased PGI2-M excretion twofold , while PGI3-M remained near detection limit .
outcome	Platelet capacity to synthesize TXA2 , and urinary excretion of TXB2 +3 - M were nearly unaffected by supplementation .
outcome	The results confirm that the minimal daily requirement of alpha-linolenic acid is 0.2-0 .3 % of total energy .

other	The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty , a new technique for the treatment of vertebral pain deriving from fracture or gross osteolytic lesion due to multiple myeloma spinal involvement .
background	Spinal osteolytic lesions are frequently associated with hematologic malignancies due to primary localization of disease ( multiple myeloma and rarely lymphoma ) or secondary effect of intensive corticosteroid therapy .
population	We treated 64 patients ( 34 males , 30 females ; mean age 71.4 + / -9.6 y ) with pain refractory to conventional medical therapy ( analgesics , bed-rest , bracing with orthopedic devices for more than 3 wk ) localized in spine , in the absence of neurologic signs .
outcome	This treatment generated swift pain relief associated with an evident augmentation in vertebral resistance .
outcome	Average preprocedural pain level for all patients was reported to be 8.04 + / -1.4 whereas average pain level at 1 and 6 months follow-up period was 1.82 + / -1.84 and 1.92 + / -1.68 , respectively .
outcome	Although preprocedure and postprocedure demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in numeric pain scores ( P < 0.01 ) , the pain level at 1 and 6 months was not considered statistically significant .
outcome	No procedure-related complications were observed in either leakages of polymethylmethacrylate in the epidural or foraminal area or in complications of pulmonary embolism for venous plexus involvement .
outcome	Vertebroplasty is widely considered as an alternative , effective , simple , and safe technique in the treatment of neoplastic vertebral localizations consequent to hematologic malignancies .
outcome	The same injection of polymethylmethacrylate can be executed before radiation therapy treatment , synergizing its delayed analgesic action to pain , after failure or in the case of local recurrences .

background	We sought to determine if patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , taking dopamine agonists ( DAs ) and reporting unintended sleep episodes ( SEs ) , exhibit physiologically defined daytime sleepiness and can thus be differentiated from those taking DAs but not
population	Twenty-four patients with abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores of > 10 who were taking DAs were enrolled into one of two groups : those with SEs ( SE + , n = 16 ) and those without ( SE - , n = 8 ) .
intervention	Three consecutive days of testing included two nights of polysomnography followed by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ) .
outcome	Overall frequency of pathological sleepiness ( MSLT < 5 min ) was 42 % ( 10/24 ) .
outcome	Mean levels of sleepiness , frequencies of pathological sleepiness , and naps with stage 2 or REM-sleep were similar between SE + and SE - groups .
outcome	Sleep tendency was similar in patients prescribed pergolide , ropinirole , and pramipexole combined with levodopa .
outcome	Polysomnography testing revealed no significant differences between the groups in total sleep time , sleep efficiency , sleep architecture , or presence of restless legs syndrome or periodic leg movements .
outcome	There was no relation between degree of nocturnal sleep disturbance and level of daytime sleepiness .
outcome	The results of this study suggest SEs in PD patients occur upon a background of excessive daytime sleepiness and are unrelated to nocturnal sleep or use of a specific DA .

other	Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager software .
other	Summary measures were produced using the weighted mean difference ( WMD ) for continuous data and relative risk ( RR ) for dichotomous data , with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) .
other	SSRIs were examined as an overall group of drugs , and as individual drugs .
outcome	Seventeen studies were included in the review , involving 3097 participants .
outcome	Based on all 17 studies , SSRIs as a group were more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of OCD between 6 and 13 weeks post-treatment , measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) ( WMD -3.21 , 95 % CI -3.84 to -2.57 ) .
outcome	The WMD for individual SSRI drugs were similar and not statistically different .
outcome	Based on 13 studies ( 2697 participants ) , SSRIs were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response at post-treatment ( RR 1.84 , 95 % CI 1.56 to 2.17 ) .
outcome	The pooled RR was shown to be similar between individual SSRI drugs .
outcome	Although reported adverse effects data were more limited , with few exceptions , the overall and individual adverse effects for the different SSRIs were always worse than for placebo and , in the majority of cases , the difference was statistically significan
outcome	Nausea , headache and insomnia were always reported amongst the most common adverse effects in trials of each of the drugs .
outcome	SSRIs are more effective than placebo for OCD , at least in the short-term , although there are differences between the adverse effects of individual SSRI drugs .
outcome	The longer term efficacy and tolerability of different SSRI drugs for OCD has yet to be established .

background	Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis is observed in more than 90 % of all cases of multiple sclerosis , producing a specific CSF IgG oligoclonal electrophoretic pattern .
background	The consensual method used as reference is isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) .
background	We developed a new CSF Ig analysis method by immunofixation ( IF ) .
intervention	The method includes an immunoenzymatic detection step performed directly on the gel allowing the use of unconcentrated CSF and avoiding the blotting step .
background	The reliability of this method was established by the analysis of 210 CSF/serum pairs including defined , probable and possible MS , other inflammatory CNS diseases and controls ( noninflammatory CNS diseases and peripheral nervous system diseases ) .
outcome	Intrathecal IgG synthesis was detected in 95.5 % of defined MS cases .
outcome	The specificity for CNS inflammatory diseases including MS diagnosis , evaluated by comparison with controls , was 98.8 % .
outcome	This new method is quicker and visual interpretation is easier than with IEF .
outcome	It is a semi-automated method that should be considered for standardization of CSF IgG analysis .

background	This study aimed to assess the effect of a hospital-based smoking cessation intervention delivered by midwives during routine antenatal and postnatal care on the smoking habits of pregnant women and their partners .
intervention	At the first antenatal visit , women in the intervention group ( n = 110 ) were given a demonstration of the immediate effects of smoking on foetal heart rate , brief smoking cessation advice and smoking cessation booklets for themselves and their partners ; a
outcome	Compared with an historical control group who received usual care ( n = 110 ) and assuming those lost to follow-up continued to smoke , biochemically-verified maternal cessation sustained from at least 24 weeks gestation to late pregnancy was 6.4 % in the int
outcome	However , there was no difference between maternal quit rates at six months postpartum .
outcome	Partners were more likely to try to quit in the intervention group , but quit rates did not differ .
outcome	Exposure to the intervention was not associated with increased levels of psychological distress , as measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire .
outcome	We conclude that this type of intervention , when implemented by staff during routine care , is probably associated with a small improvement in maternal cessation in pregnancy , similar to that produced by minimal advice to quit smoking .

background	Language barriers have been shown to negatively impact health care for immigrants .
background	We evaluated the association between language use and the diagnosis of hypertension among elderly Mexican Americans .
population	We studied subjects from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly , a cohort of 3050 Mexican American subjects age > or = 65 .
other	Measures of language included Spanish and/or English language read/spoken , language used in social situations , and language of mass media use .
other	Undiagnosed hypertension on physical exam was defined as systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg in persons who did not report previous hypertension diagnosis or were not current users of anti-hypertensive medications .
outcome	The age - and sex-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed hypertension were 50.5 % and 19.3 % , respectively .
outcome	Among 1347 older adults without previous diagnosis of hypertension that were included in the primary analysis , the mean age was 72 years and 43 % were immigrants .
outcome	After adjusting for age , gender , and education , Spanish use more often than English use in mass media was significantly associated with undiagnosed hypertension ( adjusted OR 2.2 [ 1.3-3 .6 ] ) .
outcome	Other measures of acculturation were not independently associated with undiagnosed hypertension .
outcome	In analyses restricted to persons with hypertension , similar language factors distinguished those who had been diagnosed from those whose hypertension was undiagnosed .
outcome	Mexican American elders who reported using Spanish more often than English use in mass media were more likely to have undiagnosed hypertension compared to those using English language in mass media .
outcome	Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of mass media language in hypertension awareness and management among Hispanic elders .

background	The aim of this study was to determine whether the probability of osteoporosis and osteopenia was affected by the risk factors , physical examination findings , or radiological investigations such as spinal X-rays in postmenopausal women .
other	We assessed risk factors such as use of hormone replacement therapy , physical activity level , calcium intake , smoking , caffeine consumption , long-term immobilization , previous history of fracture , family history of fracture , presence of certain systemic diseases ( hyperthyroidism or hyperparathyroidism ) , or use of medications ( corticosteroids or others ) , physical examinations , and presence of vertebral fractures on spinal X-rays .
intervention	Patients ' bone mineral density ( BMD ) was evaluated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) in the lumbar spine , and we compared the risk factors between osteopenic and osteoporotic women according to DXA .
population	We evaluated 235 postmenopausal women who attended our osteoporosis outpatient clinic .
other	Those patients were divided into two groups as either osteopenic ( n = 67 , mean age 63.1 years ) or osteoporotic ( n = 168 , mean age 66.2 years ) according to WHO criteria .
outcome	The lumbar spinal ( L1-L2 ) T-score values were -1.5 + / - 0.6 and -3.1 + / - 0.6 in osteopenic and osteoporotic groups , respectively .
outcome	There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean age and lumbar BMD ( p = 0.009 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
outcome	We also observed that vertebral tenderness on palpation , back pain , and existing vertebral fracture ( fx ) were significantly different between the osteopenic and osteoporotic groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
outcome	As a result of the statistical analysis , we found an equation to determine osteopenic and osteoporotic women by using those four factors ( age , vertebral tenderness on palpation , back pain , and existing vertebral fx ) in multivariate stepwise logistic regre
outcome	The equation is as follows : Y ( DXA ) = -2.9024 + 0.044 ( age in year ) + 0.819 ( vertebral fx ) + 0.877 ( pain ) + 1.136 ( vertebral tenderness ) .

###16961565
background	A qualitative study of parents ' perceptions of local environmental health risks was conducted to assess the fit between concepts from Dixon 's Integrative Environmental Health Model ( DIEH model ) and field-generated data .
population	This research was part of a prospective study addressing environmental exposures of rural low-income children .
other	Home visit data from 11 parents were analyzed ( 1 ) thematically and ( 2 ) according to DIEH concepts .
other	These complementary analyses allowed the researchers to examine perceptions that were congruent with or diverged from the DIEH model .
outcome	Findings revealed that participants were concerned about children 's exposure to pathogenic molds and cigarette smoke and felt uninformed about risks and prevention strategies .
outcome	Barriers to preventive actions included families ' lack of time and a disinterest in brochures .
outcome	Participants reported being `` stuck '' in substandard housing by poverty and family demands .
outcome	Results provided the researchers with confidence that the DIEH model aligned with participants ' cognitive constructions of risk .
outcome	As a result , the DIEH model was incorporated into the conceptualization for the clinical trial phase of the study .
outcome	This type of check between a theoretical approach and field data can be a helpful intermediate step for researchers involved in multiyear studies .

background	Cardiac tamponade may occur following cardiac surgery as a result of blood or fluid collecting in the pericardial space compressing the heart and reducing cardiac output .
background	Mediastinal chest drains ( including pericardial drains ) are inserted as standard post-operative practice following cardiac surgery to assist the clearance of blood from the pericardial space and to prevent cardiac tamponade .
background	To prevent chest tubes from blocking and so causing tamponade nurses manipulate them to prevent or remove clots .
background	Manipulation methods including milking , stripping , fanfolding and tapping may be applied to the tubes to keep them from blocking .
background	Evidence is required as to the safest and most effective means of preventing chest tube blockage and preventing cardiac tamponade .
population	To compare different methods of chest drain clearance ( i.e. varying levels of suction or suction in combination with milking , stripping , fanfolding and tapping of chest drains ) in preventing cardiac tamponade in patients following cardiac surgery .
other	Over both the initial review and the 2004 revision , we searched the Cochrane Heart Group trials register , the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register ( CCTR ) ( Issue 4 , 2003 ) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ( CDSR ) , the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness ( DARE ) , Issue 4 , 2003 , MEDLINE ( 1966 to Nov Week 2 , 2003 ) , EMBASE ( 1980 to 2003 Week 47 ) , CINAHL ( 1982 to Nov 2003 ) , the Clinical Trials site of the NIH , ( USA ) ( 24.11.03 ) and reference lists of articles .
other	Randomised , quasi-randomised or systematically allocated clinical trials of chest tube manipulation methods in adults and children with mediastinal chest drains following cardiac surgery were included .
other	Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .
other	Study authors were contacted for additional information where required .
other	Adverse effects information was collected from the trials .
other	Three studies with a total of 471 participants were included .
outcome	There was no data , however , which could be included in a meta-analysis .
outcome	This was due to inadequate data provision by two of the studies .
outcome	Where adequate data were provided there were no common interventions or outcomes to pool .
outcome	On the basis of single studies there was no evidence of a difference between groups on incidence of chest tube blockage , heart rate , cardiac tamponade or incidence of surgical re-entry .
outcome	There are insufficient studies which compare differing methods of chest drain clearance to support or refute the relative efficacy of the various methods in preventing cardiac tamponade .
outcome	Nor can the need to manipulate chest drains be supported or refuted by results from RCT 's .

outcome	A review of 1300 patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , over a period of 14 years , revealed 12 patients with an ` acute abdomen ' .
outcome	Seven events occurred during the initial admission , ranging from 10 days to 9 months from injury , and five during readmission of ` chronic ' SCI patients .
outcome	Four were in the acute stage 10-30 days from injury , all with peptic ulcer perforations .
outcome	The remainder had either an intestinal obstruction , appendicitis or peritonitis .
outcome	All of the neurological levels were above T6 except for one patient who had a low level paraplegia .
outcome	The classical signs of an ` acute abdomen ' may be missing in such patients thus delaying diagnosis by 1-4 days .
outcome	The most important signs were autonomic dysreflexia , referred shoulder tip pain , abdominal pain , abdominal distension , increased spasticity and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting .
outcome	Less importance was given to the classical signs of abdominal tenderness , abdominal muscle rigidity , rebound , fever and of leukocytosis .
outcome	Prompt diagnosis and treatment will minimise morbidity and mortality .

background	To identify and describe those who slim down ( become nonobese ) or become obese .
population	A cohort of 2127 school pupils was surveyed at ages 11 and 15 years .
other	At each age , those with body mass index above the 95th percentile for age and gender were categorized as obese .
other	Characteristics associated with obesity , slimming down and becoming obese were examined using ANOVA and chi-square procedures for univariate , and logistic regression for multivariate analyses .
outcome	At age 11 , 9.6 % ( males ) and 10.5 % ( females ) were obese , compared with 10.5 % ( males ) and 11.6 % ( females ) at age 15 .
outcome	Slimming down occurred for 3.5 % of the total sample , whereas 4.5 % became obese .
outcome	Obesity was associated with significant but small differences in low mood ( males at 11 ) and self-esteem ( males at 11 , females at both ages ) , and reduced rates of behavior disorders ( data on psychiatric disorders available only at age 15 ) .
outcome	Obesity was associated with weight-related worries , dieting , and poor self-rated appearance , but not most measures of peer relationships , except that obese 11-year-olds experienced greater victimization , partly accounting for their poorer well-being .
outcome	In comparison with the continuously nonobese , those who became obese had lower prior self-esteem and greater victimization , but improvements in well-being and relative reductions in victimization by age 15 .
other	Slimming down was related to neither prior nor subsequent well-being in comparison with continual obesity , but was associated with better age 15 mood in comparison with continual nonobesity .
outcome	Although overweight was fairly stable , there were shifts in and out of the obese category during adolescence .
outcome	Obesity during this life-stage , though strongly related to worries about putting on weight and self-report dieting , was associated with only small differences in psychological well-being .

background	Injury to the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) initiates a response controlled by multiple extracellular mediators , many of which contribute to the development of neuropathic pain .
background	Schwann cells in an injured nerve demonstrate increased expression of LDL receptor-related protein-1 ( LRP1 ) , an endocytic receptor for diverse ligands and a cell survival factor .
other	Here we report that a fragment of LRP1 , in which a soluble or shed form of LRP1 with an intact alpha-chain ( sLRP-alpha ) , was shed by Schwann cells in vitro and in the PNS after injury .
outcome	Injection of purified sLRP-alpha into mouse sciatic nerves prior to chronic constriction injury ( CCI ) inhibited p38 MAPK activation ( P-p38 ) and decreased expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta locally .
outcome	sLRP-alpha also inhibited CCI-induced spontaneous neuropathic pain and decreased inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal dorsal horn , where neuropathic pain processing occurs .
outcome	In cultures of Schwann cells , astrocytes , and microglia , sLRP-alpha inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of p38 MAPK and ERK/MAPK .
outcome	The activity of sLRP-alpha did not involve TNF-alpha binding , but rather glial cell preconditioning , so that the subsequent response to TNF-alpha was inhibited .
outcome	Our results show that sLRP-alpha is biologically active and may attenuate neuropathic pain .
outcome	In the PNS , the function of LRP1 may reflect the integrated activities of the membrane-anchored and shed forms of LRP1 .

background	Adrenoleukodystrophy , a sex-linked peroxisomal disorder that results in the impaired oxidation of long-chain saturated fatty acids and causes neurologic impairment , is a rare cause of Addison 's disease in children .
background	Adrenomyeloneuropathy is the name given to a biochemically identical but milder and more slowly progressive variant of adrenoleukodystrophy that affects young adults , in whom adrenal insufficiency may long precede nervous system dysfunction .
background	The transmission of adrenomyeloneuropathy , like that of most cases of adrenoleukodystrophy , is sex-linked .
background	Because of a preponderance of male patients among a group of patients with the onset of adrenal failure in childhood , we questioned whether this condition might be the initial manifestation of adrenomyeloneuropathy .

background	Surgical excision of CNV may allow stabilisation or improvement of vision .
background	A series of results of surgical excision are presented .
population	The records for 43 eyes of 40 consecutive patients undergoing surgical excision of CNV not associated with age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) were reviewed retrospectively .
other	Statistical analyses of the relationship between pre-operative factors and post-operative visual results were made .
other	Improvement or worsening of visual acuity was defined as a change of more than 2 lines of Snellen acuity .
outcome	In 79.1 % of patients visual acuity was improved or unchanged following surgery , and in 20.9 % there was a reduction of Snellen acuity .

outcome	There was a possible association between the non-use of gas tamponade and an increased chance of reduced vision .
outcome	Visual loss was more likely in those eyes with good pre-operative visual acuity .
outcome	Recurrence of CNV was noted in 10 ( 23 % ) eyes ; repeat surgery was not associated with a worse visual outcome .
outcome	Surgical excision of CNV not related to AMD is a promising technique .
outcome	More meaningful assessment of visual function in these patients will allow refinement of case selection .

other	In this study , we used the spinal microgliosis associated with L5 spinal nerve transection and minocycline-induced attenuation thereof to ( 1 ) evaluate novel software based semi-quantitative image analysis paradigms for the assessment of immunohistochemical images .
other	Microgliosis was revealed by immunoreactivity to OX42 .
other	Several image analysis paradigms were assessed and compared to a previously validated subjective categorical rating scale .
outcome	This comparison revealed that grey scale measurement of the proportion of a defined area of spinal cord occupied by OX42 immunoreactive cells is a robust image analysis paradigm .
outcome	( 2 ) Develop and validate a flow cytometric approach for quantification of spinal microgliosis .
outcome	The flow cytometric technique reliably quantified microgliosis in spinal cord cell suspensions , using OX42 and ED9 immunoreactivity to identify microglia .
outcome	The results suggest that image analysis of immunohistochemical revelation of microgliosis reliably detects the spinal microgliosis in response to peripheral nerve injury and pharmacological attenuation thereof .
outcome	In addition , flow cytometry provides an alternative approach for quantitative analysis of spinal microgliosis elicited by nerve injury .

population	Duration of breast feeding was studied in 249 randomly chosen , healthy , term infants of Danish origin of which 80.7 % participated .
outcome	Breast feeding was initiated by 99.5 % of the mothers .
outcome	At 3 , 6 and 9 months , 71 % , 52 % and 33 % , respectively , were still breast feeding .
outcome	Only 1 infant ( 0.5 % ) was exclusively breast fed beyond 7 months of age .
outcome	In a Cox multiple regression analysis of factors influencing duration of breast feeding , we found a positive association with maternal education ( p < 0.001 ) and age ( p = 0.02 ) and a negative association with the amount of formula given at the maternity
outcome	Six months after delivery , 79 % of the mothers with higher school education ( > or = 12 years ) were still breast feeding , compared to 29 % with a low school education ( < or = 9 years ) .
outcome	There is still a need for an increased effort to support mothers in breast feeding , focusing particularly on younger mothers with short school education .
outcome	Formula supplements during the first days of life , given to 73 % of the infants , were associated with a shorter duration of breast feeding and should be discouraged .

background	To investigate the relationships among intoxication at time of injury , preinjury history of problem drinking , and early functional status in patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
study design	Prospective cohort study .
other	Acute inpatient TBI rehabilitation .
population	Participants were 1748 persons with TBI .
other	Not applicable .
other	Blood alcohol levels ( BALs ) were obtained at admission to the emergency department , and a history of problem drinking was obtained through interview .
other	Study outcomes , Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) , and FIM instrument scores were gathered at admission to inpatient rehabilitation .
outcome	Multivariate regression analysis revealed that BAL and a history of binge drinking were predictive of DRS , but not FIM , scores .
outcome	A higher BAL was associated with poorer functional status on the DRS.
outcome	Paradoxically , a history of binge drinking was associated with more intact functional status on the DRS.
outcome	The relationships among intoxication at time of injury , history of problem drinking , and early outcome after TBI were modest .
outcome	Injury severity had a more significant association with TBI functional status .

study design	Randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) .
other	To compare the effectiveness of training and equipment to reduce musculoskeletal injuries , increase comfort , and reduce physical demands on staff performing patient lifts and transfers at a large acute care hospital .
background	Back injury to nursing staff during patient handling tasks is a major issue in health care .
background	The value of mechanical assistive devices in reducing injuries to these workers is unclear .
other	This three-armed RCT consisted of a `` control arm , '' a `` safe lifting '' arm , and a `` no strenuous lifting '' arm .
other	A medical , surgical , and rehabilitation ward were each randomly assigned to each arm .
intervention	Both intervention arms received intensive training in back care , patient assessment , and handling techniques .
other	Hence , the `` safe lifting '' arm used improved patient handling techniques using manual equipment , whereas the `` no strenuous lifting '' arm aimed to eliminate manual patient handling through use of additional mechanical and other assistive equipment .
outcome	Frequency of manual patient handling tasks was significantly decreased on the `` no strenuous lifting '' arm .
outcome	Self-perceived work fatigue , back and shoulder pain , safety , and frequency and intensity of physical discomfort associated with patient handling tasks were improved on both intervention arms , but staff on the mechanical equipment arm showed greater improv
outcome	Musculoskeletal injury rates were not significantly altered .
outcome	The `` no strenuous lifting '' program , which combined training with assured availability of mechanical and other assistive patient handling equipment , most effectively improved comfort with patient handling , decreased staff fatigue , and decreased p
outcome	The fact that injury rates were not statistically significantly reduced may reflect the less sensitive nature of this indicator compared with the subjective indicators .

###8620787
background	Our goal was to evaluate use of topical ( 4 percent ) formalin in management of radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis , refractory to other methods of treatment .
background	Specifically , we wished to determine its safety , ability to stop bleeding , and complications associated with therapy .
population	Sixteen patients with radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis were treated with topical ( 4 percent ) formalin .
background	All had been previously treated with conservative regimens such as cautery , topical steroids , or laser , but these had failed .
intervention	Five-hundred milliliters ( ml ) of a 4 percent formalin solution was instilled into the rectum in 50-ml aliquots .
intervention	Each aliquot was kept in contact with rectal mucosa for approximately 30 seconds .
intervention	Treatments were performed under local anesthesia in nine patients , sedation only in four , spinal in two , and general in one patient .
outcome	In 12 patients , bleeding stopped after a single formalin instillation ; in 3 , bleeding was considerably reduced but continued sporadically .
outcome	One patient required three treatments before bleeding stopped .
outcome	Four patients developed postoperative anal pain , of which one also had significant tenesmus and reduced capacity .
outcome	Of these four patients , only two had significant anal pain and fissures that lasted longer than one month .
outcome	Topical ( 4 percent ) formalin is safe and effective in treatment of radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis .
outcome	A single treatment will stop bleeding in 75 percent of patients .

###15566835
background	Chronic progressive disorders of the central nervous system ( CNS ) impose diagnostic problems , particularly in younger patients .
background	The demonstration of antibodies against measles virus ( MV ) in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) plays a major role in the laboratory diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) as well as multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
other	Because intrathecally synthesized antibodies against MV can be found in both diseases , it is necessary to establish easy and reliable methods to improve the differential diagnosis .
population	Seventy-one paired serum/CSF samples obtained from patients with the diagnosis of SSPE ( n = 23 ) , MS ( n = 14 ) , or acute postinfectious measles encephalitis ( APME , n = 8 ) have been examined .
other	The reactivity of intrathecally synthesized immunoglobulin to individual recombinant MV structural proteins was assessed using Western blot analysis , ELISA as well as isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) .
outcome	All CSF samples obtained from patients suffering from SSPE showed a strong antibody response to MV-nucleocapsid ( N ) and phosphoprotein ( P ) .
outcome	Sera from 15 of the 23 SSPE patients were reactive to MV-fusion protein ( F ) .
outcome	Faint reactivity was obtained against MV-matrix ( M ) or hemagglutinin protein ( H ) in the minority of samples ( 40 and 20 % , respectively ) .
outcome	CSF samples of MS patients only revealed a clear response to N , and in two cases to F.
outcome	The other proteins were not recognized in the CSF samples of MS patients .
outcome	In contrast to SSPE , the IEF of CSF from MS patients revealed only few MV-specific oligoclonal bands .
outcome	In the CSF samples from APME patients , intrathecal MV antibodies were not detected .
outcome	This study shows that discrimination between SSPE and MS can be achieved in doubtful cases by IEF using MV-N , P and F proteins .

###2735279
background	The vast majority of periventricular abnormalities visualized with MR imaging in patients less than 50 years old represents multiple sclerosis ( MS ) lesions .
background	There are many other causes of periventricular lesions , most of which can be differentiated from MS on the basis of history and physical or MR findings .
population	Five cases of biopsy - or Kveim test-proved sarcoidosis with MR findings consistent with MS are reported .
outcome	Each of these patients , diagnosed as having sarcoidosis , had symptoms identical to those seen in MS.
outcome	Although these patients have not had histologic characterization of the intraparenchymal lesions seen on MR , they illustrate the difficulty of differentiating sarcoidosis with CNS involvement from MS in some patients on the basis of clinical , radiographic
outcome	This series contributes to a growing body of evidence that neurosarcoidosis probably should be included in the differential diagnosis of isolated periventricular lesions in patients less than 50 years old .

###2323514
population	Continuous 72-h recordings of duodenojejunal contractile activity were obtained from 20 freely ambulant subjects ; pressure was detected by two strain-gauge sensors incorporated in a transnasal catheter attached to an encoder and a miniature tape recorder .
population	The subjects were 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome , 6 of whom were constipation predominant and 6 of whom were diarrhea predominant , and 8 healthy controls .
other	The procedure was well tolerated by all subjects and did not interfere with sleep or normal activity .
outcome	In all subjects , the diurnal migrating motor complex cycle was characterized by a brief phase 1 and a prolonged phase 2 ; this was reversed during sleep when phase 2 was virtually absent .
outcome	All subjects showed a circadian variation in migrating motor complex propagation velocity , and there was no difference in the patterns of motor activity during sleep between any of the groups .
outcome	During the day , the duration of postprandial motor activity was shorter in irritable bowel syndrome patients than in controls , and diurnal migrating motor complex intervals were shorter in diarrhea-predominant than in constipation-predominant irritable bo
outcome	In 11 of 12 inflammatory bowel syndrome patients , episodes of clustered contractions recurring at 0.9-min intervals were noted ; these episodes had a mean duration of 46 min and were often associated with transient abdominal pain and discomfort .
outcome	In both groups of irritable bowel syndrome patients , defecation was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) prolonged with a greater number of voluntary abdominal contractions ( p less than 0.01 ) than in controls .
outcome	Prolonged ambulant monitoring of proximal bowel motor activity in subjects who are free to move , eat , and sleep as they choose has , for the first time , clearly defined the striking difference in motility between the sleeping and waking state and shown tha

###11916368
background	There are few published studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) among substance abusers seeking treatment .
population	Eleven patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for cocaine dependence and adult ADHD were entered into a 12-week single-blind trial of divided daily doses of bupropion ( BPR ) .
intervention	All patients received weekly individual standardized relapse prevention therapy .
outcome	Treatment compliance and retention were good .
outcome	Patients reported significant reductions in attention difficulties , hyperactivity and impulsivity .
outcome	Self-reported cocaine use , cocaine craving , and cocaine positive toxicologies , also decreased significantly .
outcome	In a previously published trial , 12 patients who met similar diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD and cocaine dependence were entered into a 12-week trial of divided daily doses of sustained-release methylphenidate ( MPH ) .
outcome	Improvements observed on BPR were similar to , and did not differ from those previously observed with MPH .
outcome	These preliminary data suggest that BPR may be as effective as sustained-release MPH , when combined with relapse prevention therapy , for cocaine abusers with adult ADHD .
outcome	However , a future study directly comparing BPR to MPH in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial is needed .

###15338064
background	Quality of life ( QoL ) is an important outcome measure in clinical studies .
background	However , there is little experience with the interpretation of QoL results .
intervention	To guide interpretation of QoL results from a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) targeting the effectiveness of the immune modulator G-CSF on postoperative recovery in high risk ( ASA III/IV ) colorectal cancer patients , we compared RCT data with data from a
other	QoL was assessed using the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-C30 and CR38 questionnaires .
other	QoL results were analysed on discharge from hospital and six months postoperatively .
outcome	Colorectal cancer patients ( both from the RCT and the cohort study ) showed the greatest differences in QoL scores compared to norm reference data at discharge from hospital .
outcome	Six months postoperatively , global quality of life and pain approximated norm reference values indicating optimal recovery .
outcome	However , deficits still appeared in scores for role functioning , physical functioning , social functioning and fatigue .
outcome	The best improvements ( discharge from hospital to six months postoperatively ) were seen with respect to physical functioning , fatigue and pain .
outcome	For further analysis of RCT data , physical functioning and fatigue scores may be more sensitive than global quality of life to detect differences in treatment effects .

###6152313
background	The regional distribution of blood flow following intracranial haemorrhage at arterial pressure was measured with the 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique in Sprague Dawley Rats .
outcome	With uncontained haemorrhage , there was a bilateral reduction in cerebral blood flow , associated with a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure .
outcome	With contained intracerebral haemorrhage there was a profound ipsilateral reduction in flow in the hemisphere adjacent to the haematoma .
outcome	This study indicates that extensive cerebral ischaemia occurs immediately after an intracerebral haemorrhage , and that this may be the result of compression of the microcirculation .

###6968424
background	Traction lesions of the brachial plexus are becoming more frequent .
background	Many of the lesions involve avulsion of nerve roots from the spinal cord .
background	This very often results in severe pain which is associated with deafferentation .
background	Although reference to this pain and the difficulty in its management has been made in several reports in the literature , there has been no long-term study of the natural history of this pain and the effects of various attempts to mitigate it .
population	This series reports on a long-term follow-up of 275 patients of which is 108 had evidence of avulsion lestions .
other	Of these 108 , 98 suffered significant pain .
outcome	There is a remarkably constant description of the pain and the various activities that may affect it .
outcome	Drugs are of very limited use and the most valuable method of treatment found in this series was transcutaneous electrical stimulation -- although , only one-third responded dramatically to this treatment .
outcome	The single most effective manoeuvre that reduces pain is absorption by the patient in work .
outcome	There remains a significant number of young men with severe pain who may expect to suffer such pain indefinitely .
outcome	There is urgent need for new methods to be developed to control this pain .

###16133135
background	Neuropathic pain is characterised by hyperexcitability within nociceptive pathways that manifests behaviourally as allodynia and hyperalgesia and remains difficult to treat with standard analgesics .
background	However , antidepressants have shown reasonable preclinical and clinical anti-nociceptive efficacy against signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain .
other	To ascertain whether inhibition of serotonin ( 5-HT ) and/or noradrenaline ( NA ) and/or dopamine ( DA ) re-uptake preferentially mediates superior anti-nociception in preclinical pain models .
population	The 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine ( 3-30 mg/kg ) , the NA re-uptake inhibitor reboxetine ( 3-30 mg/kg ) , the dual 5-HT and NA re-uptake inhibitor venlafaxine ( 3-100 mg/kg ) and the dual DA and NA re-uptake inhibitor bupropion ( 3-30 mg/kg ) were tested afte
outcome	Reboxetine and venlafaxine dose-dependently attenuated second-phase flinching in the formalin test ; fluoxetine attenuated flinching only at the highest dose tested , whereas bupropion was ineffective .
outcome	In the chronic constriction injury ( CCI ) and spinal nerve ligation models of neuropathic pain , hindpaw mechanical allodynia was significantly attenuated by fluoxetine and particularly by bupropion .
outcome	Reboxetine and venlafaxine were completely ineffective .
outcome	In contrast , reboxetine and venlafaxine reversed thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats , whereas bupropion and fluoxetine were either minimally effective or ineffective .
outcome	Fluoxetine , reboxetine and venlafaxine transiently increased the tail-flick latency in uninjured animals .
outcome	Anti-nociceptive doses of drugs had no effect on motor function .
outcome	Combined re-uptake inhibition of 5-HT and NA appears to confer a greater degree of anti-nociception in animal models of experimental pain than single mechanism of action inhibitors .
outcome	The selective attenuation of mechanical allodynia by bupropion suggests that the additional re-uptake of DA may further augment 5-HT/NA re-uptake mediated anti-nociception after nerve injury .

###2092556
background	A 56-year-old patient suffered intractable radicular pain from spondylolisthesis L5/S1 .
background	There was no help from PLIT-fusion but pain decreased substantially by spinal cord stimulation with a PISCES-system .
background	On Nov 8th 1987 the battery exhausted gradually whereas the patient increased the output up to maximum .
background	When changing to a new battery he suffered an electric shock .
outcome	Acute opistonus with a jump from his wheelchair occurred with maximal innervation of the muscles of his left leg resulting in a comminuted fracture of his left acetabulum .
outcome	There seems to be a need for more information and precautions on involuntary overstimulation in the use of neurostimulators .

###17825546
background	Fatty acid deficiency symptoms ( FADS ) of dry hair and skin , frequent thirst and urination have been observed to be higher in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
population	Two studies investigated FADS in 7-12-year-old children ; Study 1 in a general population ( N = 347 ) and Study 2 in children with ADHD symptoms ( N = 104 ) .
outcome	Correlations between FADS and ADHD-related symptoms were found at baseline in Study 1 but not Study 2 .
outcome	FADS did not improve after supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) versus placebo after 15 weeks in Study 2 , and were not related to improvements in ADHD symptoms in the PUFA groups .
outcome	However , FADS did improve in all groups , possibly attributable to the linoleic acid present in both the PUFA and placebo ( palm oil ) supplements .
outcome	FADS are not a reliable selection criterion for children with ADHD who might benefit from omega-3 PUFA supplementation .

study design	STUDY DESIGN : Case report .
background	To report a novel management strategy for neuropathic pain management after spinal cord injury .
other	Outpatient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) clinic .
population	The patient demonstrated two neuropathic pain syndromes , namely at - and below-level pain .
intervention	These syndromes were recalcitrant to conservative measures and a decision was made to proceed with intrathecal therapies .
outcome	The patient 's at-level pain was responsive to intrathecal hydromorphone but the below-level pain was unaffected by this intervention .
outcome	Intrathecal ziconotide provided an opposite response with a positive effect observed on the below-level pain and minimal effect on the at-level pain .
outcome	The combination of intrathecal ziconotide and hydromorphone provided effective relief for both components of the patient 's SCI associated neuropathic pain .
outcome	The combination of intrathecal ziconotide and hydromorphone has the potential to provide significant pain relief for patients with neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury .

intervention	Hysteroscopic SSG .
other	Patency rate of tubes by SSG .
other	Pregnancy rate following SSG .
outcome	Eighty cases were divided into the study group ( SSG performed , 37 cases ) and the case-control group ( SSG not performed , 43 cases ) .
outcome	Successful SSG of at least one tube was obtained in all of 37 cases ( 100 % ) in whom SSG was attempted .
outcome	A patency rate of 95.9 % was documented in the 73 cannulated tubes of these cases .
outcome	The total subsequent pregnancy rate ( 48.6 % ) within 12 months of follow-up after SSG was significantly higher than that ( 11.6 % ) obtained in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .
outcome	The cumulative pregnancy rate in the study group was also significantly higher than that in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .
outcome	The findings of the present study encourage the application of SSG to infertile women , either as a sole therapeutic approach or in association with other methods of assisted reproductive technology , even if their fallopian tubes are shown to be patent by

background	Effective alternatives to long waiting lists for entry into methadone hydrochloride maintenance treatment are needed to reduce the complications of continuing heroin dependence and to increase methadone treatment entry .
other	To compare the effectiveness of interim methadone maintenance with that of the usual waiting list condition in facilitating methadone treatment entry and reducing heroin and cocaine use and criminal behavior .
study design	Randomized , controlled , clinical trial using 2 conditions , with treatment assignment on a 3:2 basis to interim maintenance-waiting list control .
other	A methadone treatment program in Baltimore .
population	A total of 319 individuals meeting the criteria for current heroin dependence and methadone maintenance treatment .
intervention	Participants were randomly assigned to either interim methadone maintenance , consisting of an individually determined methadone dose and emergency counseling only for up to 120 days , or referral to community-based methadone treatment programs .
other	Entry into comprehensive methadone maintenance therapy at 4 months from baseline ; self-reported days of heroin use , cocaine use , and criminal behavior ; and number of urine drug test results positive for heroin and cocaine at the follow-up interview conducted at time of entry into comprehensive methadone treatment ( or at 4 months from baseline for participants who did not enter regular treatment ) .
outcome	Significantly more participants assigned to the interim methadone maintenance condition entered comprehensive methadone maintenance treatment by the 120th day from baseline ( 75.9 % ) than those assigned to the waiting list control condition ( 20.8 % ) ( P < .0
outcome	Overall , in the past 30 days at follow-up , interim participants reported significantly fewer days of heroin use ( P < .001 ) , had a significant reduction in heroin-positive drug test results ( P < .001 ) , reported spending less money on drugs ( P < .001 ) , a

population	Sixty-one noncompliant subjects and 102 persons compliant with regularly scheduled annual examinations were paid to come to the clinic for evaluation .
other	Each participant completed a psychological questionnaire comprised of theoretical and socioeconomic variables .
outcome	There was no difference between the two groups according to gender , race , level or completeness of injury , education , etiology of injury , responses to questions from the Health Locus of Control Scale , Health Beliefs Model , inconvenience or discomfort .
outcome	For noncompliant versus compliant persons , cost ( P = 0.0002 ) , distance ( P = 0.0047 ) , transportation ( P = 0.0330 ) , belief that follow-up was not necessary ( P < 0.0001 ) , availability of good local doctor ( P = 0.0001 ) and time ( P = 0.0209 ) were identified

background	Impaired recall is a common consequence of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
background	Predicting recall during learning is a critical part of self-monitoring .
population	Adults with TBI and noninjured controls made recall predictions of noun pairs that varied in prediction timing ( immediate , delayed ) , and predictions of narrative information that varied in salience ( main idea and details ) and explicitness ( stated and impl
outcome	For both groups , delayed recall predictions for noun pairs and stated ( narrative ) information were relatively accurate , whereas immediate recall predictions of noun pairs and delayed predictions of implied information were relatively inaccurate .
outcome	Both groups were more confident making predictions of stated information than implied information .
outcome	Neither predictive accuracy nor confidence generalized across tasks .
outcome	Working memory load across tasks and individual differences are proposed explanations .
outcome	The lack of generalization highlights the need to train domain or task-specific self-monitoring .

###9818026
background	NAD ( P ) H : quinone oxidoreductase ( DT-diaphorase ; DTD ) plays a major role in activating mitomycin C ( MMC ) in human colon and gastric carcinoma cell lines .
background	Thus , measurement of DTD in clinical tumor samples could be beneficial in designing adjuvant chemotherapy .
outcome	We explored immunological quantitation of DTD protein using a monoclonal antibody against DTD , demonstrating a close correlation between protein expression and enzyme activity of DTD in colon and gastric carcinoma cell lines and in colorectal tumor sample
outcome	This indicates that such immunoblot analysis is a simple alternative method for quantitating DTD in clinically excised samples .
outcome	In most colorectal tumor samples , the tumors expressed larger amounts of DTD than did the peripheral normal tissues , suggesting a selective toxicity of MMC toward tumor cells .
outcome	Also tumors with nodal metastases showed significantly higher DTD levels than did tumors without metastasis .
outcome	These results raise the possibility that DTD expression is related to tumorigenesis and malignant progression of colorectal tumors .
outcome	Measurement of DTD by the immunological method described here could be beneficial in designing a rational adjuvant chemotherapy with MMC .

###11728162
background	We have previously shown that dietary ( n-3 ) fatty acids decrease mammary tumor vascularization and PGE ( 2 ) production .
background	One possible mechanism may be the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production by PGE ( 2 ) .
other	Macrophages are major producers of VEGF , and thus we assessed the role of PGE ( 2 ) in vitro and in vivo on their VEGF production .
outcome	When added to macrophages , pharmacological ( 10 ( -7 ) M ) but not physiological ( 10 ( -9 ) to 10 ( -11 ) M ) concentrations of PGE ( 2 ) increased VEGF mRNA and protein levels .
outcome	That increased expression was relatively rapid and sustained up to 8 hrs , but declined by 24 hrs .
outcome	Similarly , dibutryl cAMP increased production of VEGF protein which was completely inhibited by H89 .
outcome	Addition of cAMP-elevating agents further potentiated the production of VEGF by PGE ( 2 ) .
outcome	Next , ( n-3 ) and ( n-6 ) fatty acids were added to macrophages in vitro or provided in the diet .
outcome	Macrophages of mice fed safflower oil ( n-6 ) had 2 - to 4-fold greater copy number of VEGF transcripts after lipopolysaccarhide ( LPS ) stimulation compared to fish oil ( n-3 ) .
outcome	A decreasing trend was seen in LPS-induced VEGF secretion from macrophages in vitro after docosahexaenoic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid incubation compared to arachidonic acid .
outcome	While pharmacological concentrations of PGE ( 2 ) modulate VEGF expression , physiological alterations did not alter VEGF protein production by macrophages .

other	In this study , telemedicine and the use of advanced telemedicine technologies are explained .
background	Telemedicine is the use of modern telecommunications and information technologies for the provision of clinical care to individuals at a distance , and transmission of information to provide that care .
background	Telemedicine can be used for decision making , remote sensing , and collaborative arrangements for the real-time management of patients at a distance .
background	The use of telecommunications and information technologies in providing health services is determined .

###17572250
background	This study investigated whether reduced levels of circulating endothelial progenitors cells ( EPCs ) in chronic heart failure ( CHF ) are secondary to an exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) in the bone marrow or to reduced mobilization .
background	Circulating EPCs presumably originate from bone marrow-derived HSC .
background	Persistent mobilization of EPCs was shown to be associated with favorable left ventricular infarct remodeling processes .
population	We assessed the number and functional capacity of EPCs in 17 healthy controls , 25 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM ) , and 20 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) .
other	To document an impairment of HSC function in the bone marrow , the colony-forming unit capacity of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and the number of CD34 + HSCs were examined in 6 healthy volunteers , 94 ICM patients , and 25 DCM patients .
outcome	The number of EPCs was reduced in CHF , irrespective of its etiology .
outcome	In contrast , the migratory capacity was selectively impaired in EPCs of ICM patients ( 4.8 + / - 4.0 migrated cells ; DCM 9.7 + / - 5.8 ; p = 0.02 ) .
outcome	On multivariate analysis , ICM , advanced New York Heart Association functional class , and CHF were independent predictors of functional EPC impairment .
outcome	The number of bone marrow-derived CD34 + cells did not differ between the CHF populations .
outcome	However , colony-forming units ( CFUs ) were selectively reduced in ICM patients ( 54.4 + / - 24.6 ; DCM 68.1 + / - 26.9 ; p < 0.02 ) .
outcome	Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the only independent predictor of impaired CFU capacity .
outcome	Impaired CFU capacity was associated with reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the bone marrow plasma .
outcome	Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with selective impairment of progenitor cell function in the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood , which may contribute to an unfavorable left ventricular ( LV ) remodeling process .

background	Sjögren-Larsson syndrome ( SLS ) is characterized by congenital ichthyosis , mental retardation and spastic di - or tetraplegia .
background	All patients older than one year have glistening dots in the fundus of the eye .
background	SLS has autosomal recessive inheritance .
population	All 35 SLS patients in Sweden , alive in 1978 , were examined physically and neurologically by the authors .
outcome	Prematurity was common but did not have any prognostic importance .
outcome	Thirty-two patients had non-progressive pronounced or severe spastic diplegia , and two had severe tetraplegia .
outcome	Those who were most motor-handicapped were also most mentally retarded .
outcome	However , the degree of ichthyosis and the changes in the ocular fundus varied independently of the cerebral symptoms .
outcome	There were no morphological abnormalities of the brain found in cranial computed tomography .
outcome	Shortness of stature was due to poor development of paretic legs and contractures in joints and the spine due to spasticity .
outcome	SLS should be suspected in a child with congenital ichthyosis .
outcome	The diagnosis is confirmed when signs of spasticity and mental retardation are present before the age of three years .

background	Functional mitral regurgitation ( MR ) is a powerful predictor of poor prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD ) .
background	However , severity of MR varies with dynamic exercise .
other	Accordingly , we sought to assess the prognostic value of exercise-induced changes in functional MR in patients with LVSD and functional MR at rest .
population	One hundred four patients with chronic heart failure due to LVSD ( ejection fraction [ EF ] < 45 % ) and functional MR at rest underwent conventional continuous 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography at rest and during maximal symptom-limited exercise .
other	The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality .
other	The median follow-up period was 20 months .
other	Fifty-six patients ( 54 % ) had ischemic cardiomyopathy .
outcome	When feasible , all 56 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy had undergone revascularization procedures before enrollment into the study .
outcome	In the whole patient cohort , resting LV end-diastolic volume was 205 + / - 76 mL and EF was 26 % + / - 9 % .
outcome	Univariate predictors of death were functional class ( New York Heart Association ) , LV EF , LV end-diastolic volume , resting mitral effective regurgitant orifice , mitral E deceleration time , tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion < or = 14 mm , systol
outcome	Exercise-induced change in mitral effective regurgitant orifice did not predict survival ( HR 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.94-1 .04 , P = .63 ) .
outcome	By Cox multivariate analysis , resting LV end-diastolic volume and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion < or = 14 mm were the independent predictors of death .
outcome	Exercise Doppler echocardiography does not refine the predictive value of resting Doppler echocardiography in patients with LVSD and functional MR at rest .

background	The prognosis for survival has improved dramatically for cancer patients over the past three decades .
background	Advances in systemic therapy have prolonged survival even in those who can not be cured .
background	The importance of managing spinal column disease and protecting the spinal cord has subsequently been amplified .
background	Almost any patient presenting with detectable neurologic function and enough physical reserve to withstand an operation will benefit from a spinal stabilization , pain relief , and neural decompression ; there are few exceptions .
background	Advances in surgical technique and biomaterials have not only improved survival and functional outcome , they have diminished many of the postoperative complications that plagued earlier treatment techniques .
background	Methods of preventing or correcting iatrogenic deformity have improved outcome .
background	Newer fixation techniques promise to eliminate many of the causes of hardware and fixation failure previously seen .
background	Improved medical management , antibiotics , and preoperative planning , along with techniques of preoperative embolization and early postoperative mobilization have made surgical management much less risky .
background	Vertebrectomy , considered a last alternative in the past , is now coming to be seen as the conservative approach to tumor management in many situations .
background	Appropriate surgical treatment can have a dramatic impact on function and outcome in patients with tumors of the spinal column , and should never be dismissed as an option without serious consideration .

###11262719
background	The validity of correcting for demographic variables when considering neuropsychological test scores was evaluated in a sample of 136 patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) who had been screened carefully for premorbid or comorbid confounding factors .
outcome	When considered in concert with neurological variables , age and education accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in raw scores on the Category Test and the Trail Making Test in the complete sample .
outcome	Gender did not affect level of test performance .
outcome	Correcting neuropsychological test scores for demographic variables did not significantly alter their success in identifying patients with severe TBI , but did lead to greater accuracy when classifying individuals with mild-moderate TBI .
outcome	This investigation concluded that norms that consider the demographic background of the individual are likely to reflect more accurately the neuropsychological status of patients with TBI than interpretations that are based exclusively on raw data .

population	Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of interventions based on psychological models compared with educational , attention or no active intervention controls to improve adherence to oral hygiene in adults with either gingivitis or periodon
other	Titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review were independently screened by two review authors .
other	Those that were clearly ineligible were rejected .
other	For the remaining studies , the full paper was reviewed by two review authors and where necessary further information was sought from the author to verify eligibility .
other	Included studies were assessed on their quality using standard criteria .
outcome	The review identified four studies ( including 344 participants ) in which a psychological model or theory had been explicitly used as the basis for the design of the intervention .
outcome	The overall quality of trials was low .
outcome	Due to the hetereogeneity between studies , both in terms of outcome measures and psychological models adopted , a meta-analysis was not possible .
outcome	The four studies adopted four different theoretical frameworks , though there was some overlap in that three of the studies incorporated elements of Operant and Classical Conditioning .
outcome	Psychological interventions resulted in improved plaque scores in comparison to no intervention groups , and in one study in comparison to an attention control group .
outcome	One study found decreased gingival bleeding in the active intervention group but no change in pocket depth or attachment loss after 4 months .
outcome	Psychological interventions were associated with improved self reported brushing and flossing in both studies which assessed these behaviours .
outcome	Only one study explored the impact of psychological interventions on beliefs and attitudes , the psychological intervention , in comparison to educational and no intervention controls , showed improved self efficacy beliefs in relation to flossing , but no ef
outcome	There is tentative evidence from low quality studies that psychological approaches to behaviour management can improve oral hygiene related behaviours .
outcome	However , the overall quality of the included trials was low .
outcome	Furthermore , the design of the interventions was weak and limited , ignoring key aspects of the theories .
outcome	Thus , there is a need for greater methodological rigour in the design of trials in this area .

background	To determine the effect of a laxative alone and in combination with tegaserod in alleviating pain and improving stool frequency in adolescents with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome .
population	Forty-eight postpubertal adolescents of both sexes with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome , as defined by Rome II criteria , were randomly allocated to Group A ( n = 27 ) for treatment with a laxative ( polyethylene glycol 3350 oral solution ) o
other	Symptoms of abdominal pain ( scale 0-10 ) and frequency of bowel movements were recorded daily in the pre-treatment phase and the post-treatment phase after a 7-day ` washout ' period .
other	Patients served as their own controls .
outcome	Treatment with the laxative alone ( Group A ) resulted in significant increase in frequency of bowel movements ( P < 0.05 ) , but not significant improvement in pain ( P > 0.05 ) .
outcome	Treatment with the combination of the laxative and tegaserod ( Group B ) led to significant increase in the frequency of bowel movements and also significant reduction in pain ( P < 0.05 ) .
outcome	The laxative alone improved stooling but not pain in adolescents with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome .
outcome	Addition of tegaserod resulted in alleviation of pain as well .

population	In a large population-based multiple sclerosis ( MS ) sample ( n = 7,951 ) , 116 twins were identified ( 1.4 % ) , of which it was possible to contact 97 .
other	In 27 pairs , the twin of the patient with MS was dead .
other	Among the 70 remaining pairs , 16 were excluded because either the index patient or their twin did not accept protocol requirements .
other	The final sample included 54 pairs .
other	Twin zygosity was determined by DNA fingerprint analysis .
other	We found 17 monozygotic pairs and 37 dizygotic pairs .
outcome	One of the 17 monozygotic pairs ( 5.9 % ) and 1 of the 37 dizygotic pairs ( 2.7 % ) were concordant for MS.
outcome	In 42 of the clinically unaffected twins , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the brain was performed , and 9 scans were classified as indicative of MS.
outcome	Three of these 42 patients had abnormal visual-evoked potentials , but all 3 had normal MRI scans .
outcome	The overall proportion of pairs in which the co-twin had some form of clinical , radiological , or electrophysiological abnormality was approximately 30 % ; this proportion was independent of zygosity .

background	To what extent does the scientific literature have an impact on current clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) in trauma surgery ?
population	We searched for CPGs on the initial management of multiply injured patients and assessed the quality of literature search and appraisal within these CPGs .
other	Secondly , we compiled a list of all medical journal with relevance to prehospital trauma care .
other	Lastly , we performed a hand search for randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) in some of the German not in Medline indexed traumatological journals .
outcome	We identified 22 CPGs of varying methodological quality .
outcome	The American guidelines scored highest .
outcome	Only 21 of the 38 journals ( 55 % ) in the field of prehospital trauma surgery were indexed in Medline , while 6 were covered only by Embase and 11 were indexed in neither of both databases .
outcome	Hand searching four non-indexed German journals identified nearly 200 RCTs .
outcome	Information flow between clinical research and CPG development remains difficult .

background	A 38-year-old man in a wheelchair for spinal cord injury from a traffic accident was referred to our hospital with complaint of dull right flank pain .
background	The patient had a history of skin ulcer formation on both toes due to poor circulation .
background	Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan revealed a huge retroperitoneal tumor compressing the right kidney .
background	Serum levels of cortisol , adrenocorticotropic hormone , aldosterone , adrenalin , noradrenalin , urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid , homovanillic acid , 17-ketosteroid and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid were all within normal limits .
other	Combining all preoperative diagnostic information , the possibility of retroperitoneal liposarcoma could not be thoroughly ruled out .
intervention	The patient consented to undergo resection of the tumor with the right kidney .
other	Prior to the scheduled operation simulation of the positioning on the operation table was done to evaluate the compressing pressure .
intervention	During operation decompressing pads were used to minimize the compressing pressure and intermittent pneumatic compression was also used to prevent pressure ulcer and facilitate circulation to the lower extremities .
intervention	Five thousands units of heparin ( FragminR , Pfizer , USA ) was used daily to prevent deep vein thrombosis until the patient could use his wheelchair .
other	Perioperative rehabilitation was conducted by a team of physical therapists .
other	The excised tumor weighed 1,320 g.

background	Several epidemiological surveys have suggested that an alteration in the habitual intake of the type rather than the amount of dietary fat may offer a nutritional means for a reduction in mortality from severe cardiac arrhythmia which can not be achieved a
background	We have examined this possibility in a series of long-term feeding studies with the small non-human primate marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus .
outcome	In both in vitro and in vivo studies of the mechanical performance of cardiac muscle we have found that diets rich in saturated fatty acids promote arrhythmia when the heart is subjected to pharmacological or ischemic stress .
outcome	Conversely , diets enriched in either omega-6 or omega-3 PUFA are beneficial , reducing the vulnerability to pharmacologically induced dysrhythmia in vitro or ischemic arrhythmia in vivo .
outcome	In addition , PUFA enriched diets enhance myocardial performance ( left ventricular ejection fraction and end diastolic volume ) and raise the electrical threshold at which ventricular fibrillation can be induced .
outcome	These diet-induced changes in cardiac performance are accompanied by significant alterations in the PUFA composition of cardiac muscle membranes , and the subsequent production of myocardial eicosanoids .

background	The purpose of this study was to examine pain experience among patients with chronic wounds , assess the utility of pain assessment scales for chronic wound-related pain , and determine the relation of wound-related pain to wound stage , affective distress ,
population	In this cross-sectional study of patients with a mix of chronic wounds ( n = 69 ) recruited for a study evaluating a telemedicine system for assessing chronic wounds , 19 men ( 12 with spinal cord injury ) with wound-related pain were identified .
intervention	Questionnaires included the Numerical Pain Rating Scale , McGill Pain Questionnaire , Brief Symptom Inventory , Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale , and the catastrophizing scale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire .
outcome	The McGill Pain Questionnaire was more sensitive to pain experience than a single rating of pain intensity .
outcome	Wound stage was positively related to severity of pain .
outcome	Pain catastrophizing was positively related to pain intensity and higher levels of affective distress and depressive symptoms .
outcome	Pain associated with chronic wounds is a significant clinical challenge for both patients and health practitioners .

background	Some prolonged and turbulent grief reactions include symptoms that differ from the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder .
background	The authors investigated a new diagnosis that would include these symptoms .
other	They developed observer-based definitions of 30 symptoms noted clinically in previous longitudinal interviews of bereaved persons and then designed a plan to investigate whether any combination of these would serve as criteria for a possible new diagnosis of complicated grief disorder .
population	Using a structured diagnostic interview , they assessed 70 subjects whose spouses had died .
other	Latent class model analyses and signal detection procedures were used to calibrate the data against global clinical ratings and self-report measures of grief-specific distress .
outcome	Complicated grief disorder was found to be characterized by a smaller set of the assessed symptoms .
outcome	Subjects elected by an algorithm for these symptoms patterns did not significantly overlap with subjects who received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder .
outcome	A new diagnosis of complicated grief disorder may be indicated .
outcome	Its criteria would include the current experience ( more than a year after a loss ) of intense intrusive thoughts , pangs of severe emotion , distressing yearnings , feeling excessively alone and empty , excessively avoiding tasks reminiscent of the deceased , u

other	Relevant journals and conference proceedings were hand searched and authors published in this field were contacted for knowledge of unpublished ongoing trials .
population	RCT 's comparing iNO with maximal conventional therapy and inhaled placebo , for AHRF in either children or adults .
other	Data were extracted and the analyses performed independently by two reviewers .
other	All 5 authors were contacted for missing data .
other	Qualitative assessment of each trial was made according to methodology described by Schulz ( Schulz 1995 ) , and analyses according to statistical methods in Review Manager MetaView 3.1 .
other	The fixed effect model was applied .
other	Where possible , sub-group analyses were performed to assess the impact of iNO in varied doses .
outcome	Five RCT 's were evaluated , assessing 535 patients with AHRF .
outcome	Inhaled nitric oxide made no impact on mortality in trials without cross-over ( RR 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.66 , 1.44 ) , or with cross-over of treatment failures to open-label iNO ( RR 1.22 , 95 % CI 0.65 , 2.29 ) .
outcome	Published evidence from one study demonstrated that iNO resulted in a transient improvement in oxygenation in the first 24 hours of treatment : the oxygenation index ( OI ) showed a mean difference of -3 [ 95 % CI -5.354 , -0.646 ] , and PaO2/FiO2 ratio , a mean d
outcome	Limited data demonstrated no difference in ventilator-free days between treatment and placebo groups , and no specific dose of iNO was significantly advantageous over another .
outcome	Other clinical indicators of effectiveness , such as duration of hospital and intensive care stay , were inconsistently reported .
outcome	There were no complications reported to be directly attributable to this treatment .
outcome	From the data provided to date , iNO had no effect on mortality and only transiently improved oxygenation in AHRF in children and/or adults .
other	There was a lack of data to assess other end points .
outcome	The long term adverse effects of this drug are not known , as no long term follow-up of trial participants has been reported .
outcome	If further trials comparing iNO with an inhaled placebo are to proceed , they should be stratified for primary disease and must specifically evaluate clinically relevant outcomes , before any benefit of iNO in AHRF can be excluded .

background	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life ( QoL ) of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) caregivers , and to determine relationships that may exist between caregiver and patient QoL .
population	Patients with definite MS ( n = 445 ) and their caregivers ( n = 445 ) were required to complete the generic , 36-item short-form ( SF-36 ) Health Survey .
other	Median SF-36 dimension scores ranged from 55 to 100 for caregivers and from 46 to 78 for patients .
outcome	Although the QoL of MS carers was not as severely affected as that of patients , caregiving was associated with lower mental health , vitality and general health scores , compared to healthy subjects .
outcome	Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between the predictors of patient QoL and caregiver QoL .
outcome	The main predictors of patient QoL were Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score , MS course , fatigue and depression .
outcome	Female gender and advanced age were the main predictors of lower QoL in caregivers .
outcome	In addition , patient BDI score was found to be a significant predictor of almost all caregiver SF-36 dimension scores , while EDSS score , disease duration and course , and patient therapeutic characteristics were found to be predictors of some caregiver SF -
outcome	Therefore , caregiver QoL was significantly influenced by patient characteristics , and supportive strategies for MS caregivers are warranted .

background	Although the need for effective ovarian cancer screening is apparent , a highly sensitive and specific screening methodology has yet to be elucidated .
background	42-44 Given that there are more than 43 million women in the United States older than 45 years of age and that the average cost of a pelvic sonogram is $ 275 ( and $ 45 for CA125 screening ) , the screening of this population is estimated to increase health
background	45 The additional cost of BRCA1 screening varies according to the level of diagnostic effort required to establish BRCA1 gene mutations in a particular family and ranges from $ 295 to $ 1,200 per sample .
background	Assuming an average cost of $ 600 per sample , initial screening of these same women would likely increased costs in excess of $ 25 billion .
background	Current knowledge and technology in ovarian cancer screening has not yet proved beneficial for the general population or for women with fewer than two affected family members .
background	For women with two or more affected family members , there is a 3 % chance of that patient being a proband in a hereditary cancer syndrome family .
background	11,46 In this group , who may be at increased risk for developing a malignancy , heightened surveillance is warranted , although there are still no data to confirm that screening even these high-risk women will reduce mortality .

background	Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) is characterized by increased peripheral vascular resistance .
background	Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , a potent endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor , is present at increased concentrations in the plasma and contributes to the regulation of vascular tone in CHF .
background	An endothelium-derived relaxing factor , nitric oxide ( NO ) , also regulates vascular tone , but endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilation is blunted in CHF .
background	An endogenous NO synthase inhibitor , asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) , which inhibits NO production and endothelium-dependent relaxation , is present at increased levels in the plasma and plays a role in impaired endothelial function in CHF .
background	However , at present , the relationship between ET-1 and impaired vascular relaxation in CHF is not well known .
other	We hypothesized that ET-1 inhibits NO-mediated vasodilation via increased ADMA production in CHF , and that an endothelin receptor antagonist can prevent this increase in plasma ADMA levels .
population	In the present study , we first examined whether circulating ADMA levels were increased in a dog model of CHF induced by 3 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing ( n = 5 ; 270 beats/min ) compared with normal dogs ( n = 5 ) .
outcome	After 3 weeks of pacing , cardiac output had decreased significantly ( 1.56 + / -0.16 compared with 2.93 + / -0.25 litres/min ; P < 0.01 ) and systemic vascular resistance had increased ( 4653 + / -374 compared with 3227 + / -396 dyn.s.cm ( -5 ) ; P < 0.01 ) in dogs with CHF
outcome	Plasma levels of both ET-1 ( 4.95 + / -0.83 compared with 2.12 + / -0.39 pg/ml ; P < 0.05 ) and ADMA ( 3.27 + / -0.49 compared with 1.91 + / -0.25 nmol/ml ; P < 0.05 ) were significantly increased in CHF dogs .
outcome	A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma ET-1 and ADMA levels ( r = 0.72 , P < 0.05 ) .
intervention	Secondly , we chronically administered an ET ( A ) receptor antagonist , TA-0201 ( 0.3 mg/kg ; n = 5 ) , to paced CHF dogs .
other	Drug administration started on day 8 of pacing and continued throughout the experiment .
outcome	TA-0201 significantly increased cardiac output ( 2.58 + / -0.24 litres/min ; P < 0.01 ) and suppressed the increases in plasma ADMA levels and systemic vascular resistance ( 2.36 + / -0.30 nmol/ml and 2423 + / -188 dyn.s.cm ( -5 ) respectively ; P < 0.05 for each ) compa
outcome	In conclusion , ET-1 contributes to the regulation of vascular tone due , in part , to increased levels of an endogenous NO synthase inhibitor in CHF , and an ET ( A ) receptor antagonist can prevent the inhibition of NO production and the increased peripheral v

other	Research literature on the outcomes of schizophrenia appearing within the last 8 years was reviewed .
outcome	First , a review of follow-up studies published in the developed world suggests that heterogeneity in outcome across individuals with schizophrenia remains the rule , with affective symptoms , later and acute onset , and responsiveness to biological treatment
outcome	Negative symptoms are associated with poor outcome , cognitive impairments , and incapacity in social and work domains .
outcome	Deterioration appears to occur within the first few months of onset if not already in the prodrome , with recent early-course studies finding longer duration of untreated psychosis associated with insidious onset , negative symptoms , social and work incapac
outcome	Second , a review of recent cross-cultural and historical studies provides evidence that outcome varies across time and place , schizophrenia having a more favourable outcome in the developing world and becoming a more benign disorder over the course of thi
outcome	Third , a review of studies of the domains of functioning within individuals identifies 4 relatively independent dimensions of depression and negative , psychotic , and disorganized symptoms .
outcome	Cognitive deficits , which are associated with negative symptoms , also constitute a relatively stable dimension over time , showing neither marked deterioration nor improvement once established early in the course of disorder .
outcome	The early appearance and stability over time of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments call for assertive intervention efforts early in the course of disorder to prevent chronicity and prolonged disability .

background	The review examined the historical progression and current status of pharmacotherapy of child and adolescent major affective disorder .
population	A MEDLINE search was used to identify double-blind , placebo-controlled studies of child and adolescent major depression .
other	Only studies that used reliable diagnostic and recovery parameters were included .
outcome	Few well-designed studies have compared placebo and tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents .
outcome	However , results consistently suggest that tricyclic antidepressants are not efficacious .
outcome	Early results of double-blind placebo-controlled trials with fluoxetine and paroxetine have shown a significant drug effect .
outcome	However , the results are inconsistent , which could reflect the ways that response to medication is defined , the ways that rating scales measure recovery , and uncertainties of dosing strategies with second-generation antidepressants .
outcome	Hypothesized reasons for the unique response pattern in youths include the changing hormonal status of children , the differential maturation of the noradrenergic versus serotonergic neurotransmitter systems , and the possibility that a large proportion of
outcome	Tricyclic antidepressants are not superior to placebo for the treatment of child and adolescent major depressive disorder .
outcome	Although two of three trials of second-generation antidepressants in this age group have had negative results , data suggest that these drugs may be more promising .
outcome	It is too early in our investigation to know whether these agents will be effective in treating major depressive disorder in children and adolescents .

background	To examine the associations between reported intakes of dietary fat and incident type 2 diabetes .
population	We studied the relation between dietary fatty acids and diabetes in a prospective cohort study of 35,988 older women who initially did not have diabetes .
other	Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline , and 1,890 incident cases of diabetes occurred during 11 years of follow-up .
outcome	After adjusting for age , smoking , alcohol consumption , BMI , waist-to-hip ratio , physical activity , demographic factors , and dietary magnesium and cereal fiber , diabetes incidence was negatively associated with dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids , vegetabl
outcome	After simultaneous adjustment for other dietary fat , only vegetable fat remained clearly related to diabetes risk .
outcome	Relative risks across quintiles of vegetable fat intake were 1.00 , 0.90 , 0.87 , 0.84 , and 0.82 ( P = 0.02 ) .
outcome	Diabetes risk was also inversely related to substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty acids and positively correlated to the Keys dietary score .
outcome	These data support an inverse relation between incident type 2 diabetes and vegetable fat and substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty acids and cholesterol .

background	When treating the patient complaining of low back pain , the physical therapist may decide to support the lumbar spine through the temporary use of a lumbar orthosis .
background	In severe cases ( generally involving fracture or instability ) the goal of orthosis application may be immobilization or significant limitation of movement .
background	In less severe cases the goal is generally the reduction of spinal stress by the application of supportive pressure to the abdomen and by supporting a flexed , neutral , or extended position of the lumbar spine .
background	A variety of orthoses is commercially available .
background	These include rigid orthotics and body casts , various types of corsets , elastic binders with molded plastic inserts , and all-elastic binders .
background	To date , however , we have not encountered a commercially available orthosis which provides abdominal support and lumbar positional support which can be varied by the patient in order to meet his changing biomechanical needs as he changes body position .

background	To evaluate the association between physical activity and the morphological , functional and physiological components of physical fitness in postmenopausal women .
population	A cross-sectional study of 162 postmenopausal women , 40-65 years of age , who verbally responded to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire applied to evaluate their level of physical activity .
other	Physical fitness was evaluated by measuring body mass index , waist circumference , body fat percentage , maximum oxygen consumption , plasma levels of total and fractional cholesterol , triglycerides and fasting glucose , as well as blood pressure .
outcome	Approximately 83.5 % of the women were active , principal physical activities being household chores and transportation walking .
outcome	Approximately 80 % of the women were overweight or obese and presented a waist circumference indicative of high or very high risk for cardiovascular disease , and fat percentage above 33 % .
outcome	Over 50 % were found to have low oxygen consumption .
outcome	There were no significant differences between the groups of active and inactive women with respect to mean body mass index ( p = 0.43 ) , percentage of body fat ( p = 0.60 ) , hip-to-waist ratio ( p = 0.93 ) , waist circumference ( p = 0.44 ) , maximum VO2 ( p = 0.32 )
outcome	Adjusted prevalence ratios also showed no significant differences between the groups .
outcome	Habitual physical activity is not associated with variations in the components that are used to describe physical fitness .
outcome	It is important to encourage physical activity and provide guidelines to ensure that it is carried out in the quantity , duration and intensity required for improving physical fitness level and obtaining health benefits .

other	The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in lumbar flexion together with the pattern and level of muscle activity of selected erector spinae during a rowing trial.Design .
study design	Cross-sectional repeated measures design .
background	Low back pain is a common problem in rowers .
background	The amount of lumbar flexion occurring during rowing might influence the possibility of injury .
population	Sixteen young adult school rowers participated in the study .
other	Changes in lumbar flexion and muscle activity were recorded across the drive phase , at three stages of an ergometer based rowing trial .
intervention	Lumbar flexion was calculated by computerised motion analysis of surface markers attached to the spinous processes of L1 and S1 .
other	Surface electromyography techniques were used to examine the magnitude of activity from three erector spinae muscles .
other	The median frequency of the electromyographic signal was examined to quantify fatigue in the erector spinae muscles during isometric maximal effort muscle activation prior to and after the rowing trial .
outcome	Lumbar flexion increased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) during the rowing trial , as did the magnitude of electromyographic activity from sites over the lumbar multifidus , iliocostalis lumborum and longissimus thoracis muscles .
outcome	The median frequency decreased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) in each muscle examined .
outcome	The findings showed that rowers attain relatively high levels of lumbar flexion during the rowing stroke , and these levels are increased during the course of the rowing trial .
outcome	Indirect evidence of muscle fatigue in erector spinae muscles was also apparent , and this observation may in part be responsible for the increased levels of lumbar flexion observed .
outcome	Excessive lumbar flexion may influence the potential for injury to spinal structures .
outcome	An awareness of increased lumbar flexion and muscle fatigue in the erector spinae muscles may be important for injury prevention programs for rowers .

background	Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs ) are associated with a series of clinical consequences leading to increased morbidity and even mortality .
background	Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention is desirable in order to remobilise patients and prevent further bone loss .
background	Not all fractures are , however , sufficiently treatable by conservative measures .
background	Here , vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty may provide immediate pain relief by minimally invasive fracture stabilisation .
outcome	In cases of acute fractures , kyphoplasty has the potential to reduce kyphosis and restore the normal sagittal alignment of the spine .
outcome	The complex nature of systemic osteoporosis , coupled with the intricate biomechanics of vertebral fractures , leads to a clinical setting which is ideally treated interdisciplinarily by the rheumatologist and spine surgeon .

background	An estimated 20 % of all breast cancer or ovarian and breast cancer cases have familial aggregation .
background	Today it is known that approximately 10 % of these cases are attributable to inherited mutations of a predisposition gene that confers a high risk of developing the disease .
background	Several genes have been identified that differ in the risks which they determine , the proportion of cases they explain and the other cancers they may cause .
background	Out of all the genes reported so far , BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most important ones .
background	The mutations in the remaining genes are rare or involve moderate or low risks .
background	The possibility to detect breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in high risk families poses serious challenges that must be faced by health professionals related with this field .

background	Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) - alpha , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , modulates inflammation and tissue injury events associated with spinal cord trauma in mice .
background	Palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) , the naturally occurring amide of palmitic acid and ethanolamine , reduces pain and inflammation through a mechanism dependent on PPAR-alpha activation .
population	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the PEA on secondary damage induced by experimental spinal cord injury ( SCI ) in mice .
intervention	SCI was induced by application of vascular clips to the dura mater via a four-level T ( 5 ) - T ( 8 ) laminectomy .
outcome	This resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema , neutrophil infiltration , and production of inflammatory mediators , tissue damage , and apoptosis .
outcome	Repeated PEA administration ( 10 mg/kg i.p. ; 30 min before and 1 and 6 h after SCI ) significantly reduced : 1 ) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury , 2 ) neutrophil infiltration , 3 ) nitrotyrosine formation , 4 ) proinflammatory cytokine expr
outcome	Moreover , PEA treatment significantly ameliorated the recovery of motor limb function .
outcome	Together , the results indicate that PEA reduces inflammation and tissue injury associated with SCI and suggest a regulatory role for endogenous PPAR-alpha signaling in the inflammatory response associated with spinal cord trauma .
