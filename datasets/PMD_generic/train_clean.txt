Background	Treatment of patients with drug-eluting stent ( DES ) in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) remains a major challenge .
Problem	This study evaluated the comparative efficacy of drug-eluting balloons ( DEB ) and everolimus-eluting stents ( EES ) in patients presenting with DES-ISR .
Method	The study design of this multicenter randomized clinical trial assumed superiority of EES for the primary endpoint , in-segment minimal lumen diameter at the @ - to @-month angiographic follow-up .
Result	A total of @ patients with DES-ISR from @ Spanish university hospitals were randomly allocated to DEB ( n = @ ) or EES ( n = @ ) .
Result	At late angiography ( median @ days ; @ % of eligible patients ) , patients in the EES arm had a significantly larger minimal lumen diameter ( @ @ mm vs. @ @ mm ; p < @ ) ( absolute mean difference : @ mm ; @ % CI : @ to @ ) , net lumen gain ( @ @ mm vs. @ @ mm ; p < @ ) , and lower percent diameter stenosis ( @ @ % vs. @ @ % ; p < @ ) and binary restenosis rate ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) , compared with patients in the DEB arm .
Result	Consistent results were observed in the in-lesion analysis .
Result	At the @-year clinical follow-up ( @ % of patients ) , the main clinical outcome measure ( composite of cardiac death , myocardial infarction , and target vessel revascularization ) was significantly reduced in the EES arm ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ; hazard ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @ to @ ) , mainly driven by a lower need for target vessel revascularization ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	In patients with DES-ISR , EES provided superior long-term clinical and angiographic results compared with DEB .
Conclusion	( Restenosis Intra-Stent of Drug-Eluting Stents : Drug-Eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-Eluting Stent -LSB- RIBS IV -RSB- ; NCT@ ) .

Background	Electrical muscle stimulation ( EMS ) is applied to critically ill patients in order to improve their muscle strength , thereby preventing hypotrophy and promoting functional recovery .
Problem	To assess the effects of early EMS on the range of movement of the ankle joint , and on thigh and leg circumference in critically ill patients .
Method	This is a prospective randomized clinical trial comprising @ patients undergoing mechanical ventilation .
Method	Before and after EMS the thigh and leg circumference in both lower limbs and the goniometry of the tibiotarsal joint were measured .
Method	The angle of @ on the goniometer was taken as the standard neutral position ( NP ) , with the arm fixed on the lateral malleolus of the ankle joint .
Method	Other measurements , namely dorsiflexion and plantar flexion , referred to as mobile arm , were taken from the NP .
Method	These recordings were obtained following an active contraction of the patients ' muscles .
Result	Compared with the electrostimulated limb , a difference in dorsiflexion of the control limb was observed ( @ versus @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	A girth of @cm of the leg was found in limb reduction when compared to the electrostimulated one ( @ versus @ cm ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	EMS used at low current intensity and for a short duration failed to prevent muscle atrophy in critically ill patients .
Conclusion	However , we did find a significant improvement in active dorsiflexion of the ankle joint suggesting that it could help to prevent against stance plantar flexion in these patients .

Problem	To study the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute non-ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) without early reperfusion intervention .
Method	A total of @ NSTEMI patients without early reperfusion intervention were enrolled in the study and randomized to the tirofiban group ( n = @ ) and the control group ( n = @ ) .
Method	Coronary angiography was performed at day @ and day @ , while percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) was performed when necessary .
Method	Parameters including thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) flow , bleeding complications and clinic events within @ days were compared between the two groups .
Result	Before PCI , no increase in the percentage of patient with TIMI flow better than TIMI-@ was observed by the treatment of tirofiban ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	While after PCI , significant increase in the percentage of patient with TIMI flow better than TIMI-@ was manifested in the tirofiban group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	Tirofiban treatment also significantly decreased the rate of poor myocardial perfusion after PCI ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	There were @ and @ major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) within @ days observed in the tirofiban group and the control group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	No difference between the two groups was found in the bleeding complications within @ days including the mild hemorrhage ( @ vs @ cases , P = @ ) , severe hemorrhage ( @ vs @ cases , P = @ ) or severe thrombocytopenia ( @ vs @ cases , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Tirofiban treatment does not increase the bleeding complications in NSTEMI patients without early PCI .
Conclusion	Tirofiban can improve the TIMI flow and the myocardial perfusion after PCI with less MACE within @ days .

Background	Recently , various near-infrared vascular imaging devices aimed at facilitating peripheral intravenous cannulation ( PIC ) were introduced , all claiming to increase success rate of PIC .
Background	We evaluated the clinical utility of a near-infrared vascular imaging device ( VascuLuminator ( ) ) in pediatric patients who were referred to the anesthesiologist because of difficult cannulation .
Method	There were @ consecutive children referred to pediatric anesthesiologists by the treating pediatrician of the in - and outpatient clinic , because of difficulties with intravenous cannulation , were included in this cluster randomized clinical trial .
Method	The presence and use of the near-infrared vascular imaging device for PIC was randomized in clusters of @ week .
Method	Success at first attempt ( Fisher exact test ) and time to successful cannulation ( Log-rank test ) were assessed to evaluate differences between groups .
Result	Success at first attempt in the group with the VascuLuminator ( ) ( @ % ) was not significantly different from the control group ( @ % , P = @ ) , neither was the median time to successful cannulation : @ s and @ s , respectively ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Visualization of blood vessels with near-infrared light and with near-infrared vascular imaging device did not improve success of PIC in pediatric patients who are known difficult to cannulate .

Problem	There is still no gold standard technique for graft fixation during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction .
Problem	We compared the functional outcomes of patients receiving either ToggleLoc with ZipLoop technology or Translig transverse crosspin device for femoral graft fixation .
Method	A total of @ patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either Translig ( ) transverse crosspin ( Translig group @ : n = @ , mean age @ years , age @-@years ) or ToggleLoc with ZipLoop technology ( ToggleLoc group : n = @ , mean age @ , age @-@years ) for femoral graft fixation .
Method	Early and @-year assessment was made with Lysholm knee scale , International Knee Documentation Committee Scoring , Tegner Activity Level Scale , KT-@ arthrometer and pivot shift test .
Result	Preoperative vs. postoperative functional parameters showed significant improvement in both groups .
Result	Two groups were similar in terms of Lysholm knee scale , IKDC and Tegner activity scores ( p > @ ) .
Result	The KT-@ arthrometer revealed slightly less anterior sliding in Translig group than that in ToggleLoc group ( p > @ ) .
Result	ToggleLoc technique allowed a radiographically more horizontal placement of the graft than Translig technique .
Conclusion	Two distinct techniques used in this study are likely to be suitable for femoral graft fixation during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the femoral tunnel being created via anteromedial approach .

Background	Structured educational programmes for patients at risk for anaphylaxis have not yet been established .

Problem	The study examined the efficacy of family-based and adolescent-only HIV prevention programs in decreasing HIV risk and improving parental monitoring and sexual communication among youths in mental health treatment .
Method	A randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with @ adolescents ( ages @-@ years ) and their caregivers from mental health settings in three U.S. cities were randomly assigned to one of three theory-based , structured group interventions : family-based HIV prevention , adolescent-only HIV prevention , and adolescent-only health promotion .
Method	Interventions were delivered during an all-day workshop .
Method	Assessments were completed at baseline and three months postintervention .
Result	Compared with those in the health intervention , adolescents in the HIV prevention interventions reported fewer unsafe sex acts ( adjusted rate ratio = @ , p = @ ) , greater condom use ( adjusted relative change = @ % , p = @ ) , and greater likelihood of avoiding sex ( adjusted odds ratio = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	They also showed improved HIV knowledge ( p < @ ) and self-efficacy ( p < @ ) .
Result	The family-based intervention , compared with the other interventions , produced significant improvements in parent-teen sexual communication ( p < @ ) , parental monitoring ( p < @ ) , and parental permissiveness ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This RCT found that the HIV prevention interventions reduced sexual risk behavior over three months in a large , diverse sample of youths in mental health treatment and that the family-based intervention improved parental monitoring and communication with teens about sex .
Conclusion	These interventions show promise .

Background	Several long-acting injectable ( LAI ) second-generation antipsychotics are now available for the management of schizophrenia .
Background	As patients with schizophrenia frequently present with diverse and challenging symptoms , it is important to understand the effects of antipsychotics in treating these different symptom subgroups and the timing of these responses .
Method	For this review , data from two randomized , double-blind trials were analyzed in respect to the onset and persistence of effects on several measures of psychopathology ( as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale -LSB- PANSS -RSB- ) after treatment with LAI paliperidone palmitate ( PP ) ( NCT@ and NCT@ ) .
Conclusion	Symptom reductions from baseline with PP were significant by day @ for all five PANSS factors in both studies .
Conclusion	Some effects may have been driven by the presence or absence of a placebo response .
Conclusion	A significant effect for PP versus placebo was observed for all major symptom domains for one or more doses of PP during the first month of treatment .
Conclusion	Once established , most ( but not all ) significant responses persisted to the end point .
Conclusion	Similar improvements were observed in PANSS scores with PP and oral risperidone .
Conclusion	Dose-dependent trends were observed for the effect of PP on positive , negative and uncontrolled hostility/excitement symptoms .

Problem	Up to @ % of patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention show some limitation in the use of drug-eluting stents .

Problem	The metabolic variability and response to acute systematic hypoxia have been characterized by the high resolution of liquid chromatography/time-of-flight/mass spectrometry ( LC-TOF/MS ) in this study .
Problem	Specifically , we compared the urinary metabolic profiles of six healthy sedentary men under normoxia ( @ % O@ ) with acute systematic hypoxic conditions of @ % ( equivalent to about @ m in altitude ) and @ % O@ ( equivalent to about @ m in altitude ) for @ h in a normobaric hypoxia chamber .
Result	A clear separation of dose-dependent responses was visualized by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis ( PLS-DA ) between normoxic and hypoxic conditions .
Result	Over one thousand features were found in this study , about @ % of which showed significant change from hypoxia treatment and @ metabolites were identified ; however , there is great variability in metabolite concentrations among the @ subjects , which reflects the diversity of human systems .
Result	Within the variability , we found that @-methyladenosine and @-methylthioadenosine are conspicuously upregulated ; on the other hand , @-inodoleacetic acid and L-glutamic acid were downregulated .
Conclusion	The increase in purine metabolic products ( uric acid , xanthine , and hypoxathine ) results from hypoxia ; this increase can be used as a marker for the hypoxic condition .
Conclusion	@-Methyladenosine was also highly upregulated from MH to SH and may be a very sensitive biomarker that reflects cellular hypoxia , due to its potential connection to HIF-@ .
Conclusion	The increase of free carnitine and acetyl carnitines , on the other hand , signals a change in the pathway of energy , or lipid , metabolism .

Background	Spatial neglect is a frequent and debilitating consequence of acquired brain injury and currently has no widely accepted standard of care .
Background	While previous interventions for spatial neglect have targeted patients ' overt spatial deficits ( e.g. , reduced contralesional visual scanning ) , far fewer have directly targeted patients ' non-spatial deficits ( e.g. , sustained attention deficits ) .
Background	Considering that non-spatial deficits have shown to be highly predictive of long-term disability , we developed a novel computer based training program that targets both sustained ( tonic ) and moment-to-moment ( phasic ) aspects of non-spatial attention ( Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training , TAPAT ) .
Background	Preliminary studies demonstrate that TAPAT is safe and effective in improving both spatial and non-spatial attention deficits in the post-acute recovery phase in neglect patients .
Background	The purpose of the current trial ( referred to as the REmediation of SPatial Neglect or RESPONSE trial ) is to compare TAPAT to an active control training condition , include a larger sample of patients , and assess both cognitive and functional outcomes .
Method	We will employ a multi-site , longitudinal , blinded randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) design with a target sample of @ patients with spatial neglect .
Method	Patients will either perform , at their home , the experimental TAPAT training program or an active control computer games condition for thirty minutes/day , five days a week , over three months .
Method	Patients will be assessed on a battery of cognitive and functional outcomes on three occasions : a ) immediately before training , b ) within forty-eight hours post completion of total training , and c ) after a three-month no-contact period post completion of total training , to assess the longevity of potential training effects .
Conclusion	The strengths of this protocol are that it tests an innovative , in-home administered treatment that targets a fundamental deficit in neglect , employs highly sensitive computer-based assessments of cognition as well as functional outcomes , and incorporates a large sample size ( relative to other neglect treatment studies ) in an RCT design .

Problem	To identify genetic markers capable of predicting the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and adverse effects of risperidone .
Method	Genotyping was performed in @ healthy volunteers receiving a single @mg oral dose of risperidone .
Method	Risperidone and hydroxyrisperidone plasma levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry.Prolactin concentration was quantified by direct chemiluminescence .
Result	Poor CYP@D@ metabolizers showed higher risperidone Cmax , area under the curve ( AUC ) , and t@/@ , as well as lower clearance .
Result	They also showed lower Cmax and AUC and higher t@/@ for hydroxyrisperidone .
Result	Furthermore , individuals with a mutant VKORC@ genotype had a lower risperidone AUC and t@/@ and higher clearance .
Result	The hydroxyrisperidone AUC was lower in individuals with the COMT mutant genotype .
Result	Risperidone increased prolactin levels ( iAUC and iCmax ) , which were higher in women than in men .
Result	The most frequent reactions were somnolence ( @ % ) , headache ( @ % ) , and dizziness ( @ % ) .
Result	Women had neurological effects and headache more frequently than men .
Result	The incidence of headache was associated with polymorphisms in the AGTR@ and NAT@ ; neurological effects were associated with CYP@C@ .

Conclusion	Differences in adverse reactions can be explained by gender and polymorphisms in CYP@C@ , AGTR@ , and NAT@ .

Problem	To investigate whether a treat-to-target strategy with methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticosteroid injections suppresses MRI inflammation and halts structural damage progression in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis ( ERA ) , and whether adalimumab provides an additional effect .
Method	In a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , @ disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-nave patients with ERA were randomised to receive methotrexate , intra-articular glucocorticosteroid injections and placebo/adalimumab ( @/@ ) .
Method	Contrast-enhanced MRI of the right hand was performed at months @ , @ and @ .
Method	Synovitis , osteitis , tenosynovitis , MRI bone erosion and joint space narrowing ( JSN ) were scored with validated methods .
Method	Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) was carried out in @ patients .
Result	Synovitis , osteitis and tenosynovitis scores decreased highly significantly ( p < @ ) during the @-months ' follow-up , with mean change scores of -@ ( median -@ ) , -@ ( -@ ) and -@ ( -@ ) , respectively .
Result	No overall change in MRI bone erosion and JSN scores was seen , with change scores of @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) .
Result	The tenosynovitis score at month @ was significantly lower in the adalimumab group , @ ( @ ) , than in the placebo group , @ ( @ ) , Mann-Whitney : p < @ .
Result	Furthermore , the osteitis score decreased significantly during the @-months ' follow-up in the adalimumab group , but not in the placebo group , Wilcoxon : p = @-@ @ and p = @-@ @ .
Result	DCE-MRI parameters correlated closely with conventional MRI inflammatory parameters .
Result	Clinical measures decreased highly significantly during follow-up .
Conclusion	A treat-to-target strategy with methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticosteroid in patients with ERA effectively decreased synovitis , osteitis and tenosynovitis and halted structural damage progression as judged by MRI .

Background	Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-@ ( MOBID-@ ) pain scale is a staff-administered pain tool for patients with dementia .
Background	This study explores MOBID-@ 's test-retest reliability , measurement error and responsiveness to change .
Method	Analyses are based upon data from a cluster randomized trial including @ patients with advanced dementia from @ Norwegian nursing homes .
Method	Test-retest reliability between baseline and week @ ( n = @ ) , and weeks @ and @ ( n = @ ) was examined in patients not expected to change ( controls ) , using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC@ @ ) , standard error of measurement ( SEM ) and smallest detectable change ( SDC ) .
Method	Responsiveness was examined by testing six priori-formulated hypotheses about the association between change scores on MOBID-@ and other outcome measures .
Result	ICCs of the total MOBID-@ scores were @ ( @-@ weeks ) and @ ( @-@ weeks ) .
Result	SEM and SDC were @ and @ ( @-@ weeks ) and @ and @ ( @-@ weeks ) , respectively .
Result	Five out of six hypotheses were confirmed : MOBID-@ discriminated ( p < @ ) between change in patients with and without a stepwise protocol for treatment of pain ( SPTP ) .
Result	Moderate association ( r = @ ) was demonstrated with Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory , and no association with Mini-Mental State Examination , Functional Assessment Staging and Activity of Daily Living .
Result	Expected associations between change scores of MOBID-@ and Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version were not confirmed .
Conclusion	The SEM and SDC in connection with the MOBID-@ pain scale indicate that the instrument is responsive to a decrease in pain after a SPTP .
Conclusion	Satisfactory test-retest reliability across test periods was demonstrated .
Conclusion	Change scores @ on total and subscales are clinically relevant and are beyond measurement error .

Background	Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in the presence of cervical spine instability may put patients at risk of cervical cord injury .
Background	Nevertheless , the biomechanics of intubation ( cervical spine motion as a function of applied force ) have not been characterized .
Background	This study characterized and compared the relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion using two laryngoscopes hypothesized to differ in force .
Method	Fourteen adults undergoing elective surgery were intubated twice ( Macintosh , Airtraq ) .
Method	During each intubation , laryngoscope force , cervical spine motion , and glottic view were recorded .
Method	Force and motion were referenced to a preintubation baseline ( stage @ ) and were characterized at three stages : stage @ ( laryngoscope introduction ) ; stage @ ( best glottic view ) ; and stage @ ( endotracheal tube in trachea ) .
Result	Maximal force and motion occurred at stage @ and differed between the Macintosh and Airtraq : ( @ ) force : @ @ versus @ @ N , respectively , P = @ ; ( @ ) occiput-C@ extension : @ @ versus @ @ degrees , respectively , P = @ .
Result	Between stages @ and @ , the motion/force ratio differed between Macintosh and Airtraq : @ @ versus @ @ degrees/N , respectively ; P = @ .
Conclusion	The relationship between laryngoscope force and cervical spine motion is : ( @ ) nonlinear and ( @ ) differs between laryngoscopes .
Conclusion	Differences between laryngoscopes in motion/force relationships are likely due to : ( @ ) laryngoscope-specific cervical extension needed for intubation , ( @ ) laryngoscope-specific airway displacement/deformation needed for intubation , and ( @ ) cervical spine and airway tissue viscoelastic properties .
Conclusion	Cervical spine motion during endotracheal intubation is not directly proportional to force .
Conclusion	Low-force laryngoscopes can not be assumed to result in proportionally low cervical spine motion .

Background	The home food environment is an important setting for the development of dietary patterns in childhood .
Background	Interventions that support parents to modify the home food environment for their children , however , may also improve parent diet .
Background	The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a telephone-based intervention targeting the home food environment of preschool children on the fruit and vegetable consumption of parents .
Method	In @ , @ parents of @-@ year-old children from @ preschools in the Hunter region of Australia were recruited to this cluster randomised controlled trial and were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group .
Method	Intervention group parents received four weekly @-minute telephone calls and written resources .
Method	The scripted calls focused on ; fruit and vegetable availability and accessibility , parental role-modelling , and supportive home food routines .
Method	Two items from the Australian National Nutrition Survey were used to assess the average number of serves of fruit and vegetables consumed each day by parents at baseline , and @ - , @ - , @ - , and @-months later , using generalised estimating equations ( adjusted for baseline values and clustering by preschool ) and an intention-to-treat-approach .
Result	At each follow-up , vegetable consumption among intervention parents significantly exceeded that of controls .
Result	At @-months the difference was @ serves ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p < @ ) , and at @-months the difference was @ serves ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
Result	Fruit consumption among intervention parents was found to significantly exceed consumption of control parents at the @ -,@ - and @-month follow-up , with the difference at @-months being @ serves ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) , and @ serves maintained at @-months , ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	A four-contact telephone-based intervention that focuses on changing characteristics of preschoolers ' home food environment can increase parents ' fruit and vegetable consumption .
Conclusion	( ANZCTR@ ) .

Problem	Heart rate characteristics monitoring for early detection of late-onset neonatal sepsis was first described in @ .
Problem	This technique , which uses mathematical methods to report the fold-increase in the risk of imminent neonatal sepsis , adds independent information to laboratory tests and clinical findings , and , in a large randomized trial , reduced NICU mortality of very low birth weight infants .
Problem	Through re-analysis and new secondary analyses of published studies , we have systematically evaluated the utility of this new risk marker for screening the growing population of premature infants .
Method	We followed the guidelines proposed by Hlatky et al. ( Circulation , @:@ -@ , @ ) , reviewed past works , and re-analyzed data from @,@ patients receiving conventional monitoring alone , @ of whom had @ episodes of proven sepsis , in the large randomized trial .
Result	Heart rate characteristics monitoring passed all phases of risk marker development from proof of concept to improvement of clinical outcomes .
Result	The predictiveness curve affirmed good calibration , and addition of the heart rate characteristics index to predictive models using standard risk factors favorably impacted the receiver operating characteristic curve area ( increase of @ ) , continuous net reclassification index ( @ ) and the integrated discrimination index ( @ ) , and compares well to other modern risk factors .
Conclusion	Heart rate characteristics monitoring is a validated risk marker for sepsis in the NICU .

Background	The bile acid derivative @-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid ( obeticholic acid ) is a potent activator of the farnesoid X nuclear receptor that reduces liver fat and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease .
Background	We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis .
Method	We did a multicentre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic acid given orally ( @ mg daily ) or placebo for @ weeks .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned @:@ using a computer-generated , centrally administered procedure , stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status .
Method	The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least @ points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment .
Method	A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at @ weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment ( @ weeks ) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial ( relative change in alanine aminotransferase -@ % , @ % CI -@ to -@ ) .
Method	A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid ( p = @ ) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in @ patients , but to continue the trial to obtain the @-week post-treatment measures .
Method	Analyses were done by intention-to-treat .
Method	This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	Between March @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid and @ to placebo .
Result	@ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the obeticholic acid group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and @ weeks had improved liver histology compared with @ ( @ % ) of @ such patients in the placebo group ( relative risk @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	@ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the obeticholic acid developed pruritus compared with nine ( @ % ) of @ in the placebo group .
Conclusion	Obeticholic acid improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification .

Problem	To investigate whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSG ) affects endometrial thickness , implantation rates , and clinical pregnancy rates in routine , unselected IVF cycles .
Method	Registered , individually randomized , two-group , parallel double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial .
Method	Academically affiliated private clinical and research center .
Method	@ consecutive , unselected , consenting women with no history of renal disease , sickle cell disease , or malignancy who were undergoing IVF .
Method	Sealed , numbered , opaque envelopes assigned @ patients to receive G-CSF ( Filgrastim , Amgen , @ g/@ @ mL ) and @ to receive placebo ( saline ) .
Method	Endometrial thickness , clinical pregnancy , and embryo implantation rates .
Result	The mean age for the whole study group was @ @ years ( G-CSF : @ @ years ; placebo : @ @ years ) .
Result	Endometrial thickness statistically significantly increased over the @-day observation period for the whole group by approximately @ mm .
Result	The increase in the G-CSF group was not statistically significantly different from the control group .
Result	Statistical models looking at treatment effects on clinical pregnancy and implantation rates demonstrated no effect of G-CSF treatment .
Result	There were no adverse events for either treatment group .
Conclusion	In normal IVF patients , G-CSF does not affect endometrial thickness , implantation rates , or clinical pregnancy rates .
Conclusion	Because these results were obtained in an older patient population , they may not necessarily apply to younger women .

Problem	The effects of i.v. remifentanil in combination with an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate tracheal extubation of deeply anesthetized adults after otologic surgery are investigated .
Method	Fifty patients undergoing middleear surgery were recruited for the study .
Method	All patients were administered deep anesthesia ( i.v. fentanil , propofol , and mivacurium ) and intubated , with subsequent administration of inhaled sevoflurane for anesthesia maintenance .
Method	Prior to endotracheal tube removal , the patients received i.v. dexamethasone , ondansetron hydrochloride , and parecoxib and were randomly allocated to two groups .
Method	In group S ( n = @ ) , anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane alone ( @ times the minimum effective alveolar concentration -LSB- MAC -RSB- ) , while patients in group SR ( n = @ ) received low-dose i.v. remifentanil and a reduced dose of sevoflurane ( @ MAC ) .
Result	The mean remifentanil dosage was @ g/kg per minute .
Result	Relative to patients in group S , patients in group SR had a significantly lower mean respiratory rate ( @ breaths per minute versus @ breaths per minute , p < @ ) and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure ( @ mm Hg versus @ mm Hg , p < @ ) after extubation .
Result	Postextubation airway obstructions requiring nasal airway placement were less frequent in group SR ( @ cases versus @ cases in group S , p < @ ) ; patients in group SR also had a shorter mean time to awakening ( @ minutes versus @ minutes , p < @ ) and a shorter mean time to orientation ( @ minutes versus @ minutes , p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Sevoflurane combined with remifentanil provided rapid recovery and appeared to be safe for deep-anesthesia tracheal extubation in adult patients after otologic surgery .

Background	With regard to clinicopathological findings and disease prognosis , breast cancer in young women is different from that in older women .
Background	However , few studies have investigated magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) characteristics of young age-onset breast cancer .
Problem	To retrospectively evaluate and compare the MR images and clinicopathological characteristics of invasive breast cancer in young women ( aged < @ years ) with those of breast cancers in older premenopausal women ( @-@ years ) .
Method	A total of @ invasive breast cancers in @ premenopausal women aged @ years and younger who underwent preoperative breast MRI and curative surgery were identified between @ and @ .
Method	The subjects were divided into a young group ( < @ years , n = @ ) and an older group ( @-@ years , n = @ ) .
Method	MRI features and clinicopathological data were compared between the two groups .
Result	The young group had more positive axillary lymph nodes , higher histologic grade , negative estrogen receptor ( ER ) , negative progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and higher p@ and Ki-@ expression compared to the older group .
Result	Using MRI , the young group was more likely to display a round/oval or lobular mass shape , a smooth mass margin , and a high signal intensity on T@-weighted images when compared to the older group .
Result	In multivariate analysis , positive axillary nodal status ( adjusted odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ ; P = @ ) , higher expression of p@ ( adjusted OR , @ ; P = @ ) , lobular mass shape ( adjusted OR , @ ; P = @ ) , and smooth mass margin ( adjusted OR , @ ; P = @ ) were independently associated with the young group .
Conclusion	MR morphologic features , including lobular mass shape and smooth mass margin , were independently associated with breast cancer in young women , in addition to positive axillary nodal status and higher p@ expression status .

Background	Potassium-channels in the carotid body and the brainstem are important regulators of ventilation .
Background	The BKCa-channel contains response elements for CO , O@ , and CO@ .
Background	Its block increases carotid body signalling , phrenic nerve activity , and respiratory drive .
Background	GAL-@ , a new BKCa-channel blocker , increases minute ventilation in rats and non-human primates .
Background	This study assessed the single-dose safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) , and pharmacodynamics ( PDs ) of GAL-@ in healthy volunteers .
Method	Thirty subjects participated in a nine-period , randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover , ascending dose , first-in-human study with i.v. infusions of @-@ @ mg kg ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) for @ h and intermediate doses up to @ h.
Result	Adverse event rates were generally similar among dose levels and between placebo - and GAL-@-treated subjects .
Result	At higher GAL-@ doses , a mild/moderate burning sensation at the infusion site occurred during the infusion .
Result	No clinically significant changes in vital signs or clinical chemistries were noted .
Result	Minute ventilation increased ( AUE@-@ h @ % , P < @ ) and end-tidal carbon dioxide ( -LSB- Formula : see text -RSB- ) decreased ( AUE@-@ h @ % , P < @ ) during the first hour at @ mg kg ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) with @/@-maximal -LSB- Formula : see text -RSB- and -LSB- Formula : see text -RSB- - change occurring by @ min .
Result	Drug concentration rose rapidly during the infusion and decreased rapidly initially ( distribution t@/@ of @ min ) and then more slowly ( terminal t@/@ of @ h ) .
Conclusion	GAL-@ was safe and generally well tolerated with adverse events comparable with placebo except for an infusion site burning sensation .
Conclusion	GAL-@ stimulated ventilation at the highest doses suggesting that greater infusion rates may be required for maximum PD effects .
Conclusion	GAL-@ had PK characteristics consistent with an acute care medication .

Problem	To observe the clinical efficacy of acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking for menstrual headache and to discuss its mechanism .
Method	Eighty-five patients with menstrual headache were randomly divided into an observation group ( @ cases ) and a control group ( @ cases ) .
Method	The observation group was treated with body acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking and the control group was treated with flunarizine hydrochloride capsules orally .
Method	The treatments of @ menstrual cycles were required .
Method	The clinical efficacy was observed in the two groups .
Method	The content of serum prostaglandin F@ , ( PGF@ ) and plasma arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) in the menstrual periods of some patients randomly selected in the two groups was tested before and after treatment and was compared with that of @ cases in a normal group .
Method	Results The total effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the observation group which was obviously superior to @ % ( @/@ ) in the control group ( P < @ ) .
Method	Before treatment , the content of serum PGF@ and plasma AVP of patients in the two groups was higher than that in the normal group ( all P < @ ) .
Method	After treatment , the content of serum PGF@ and plasma AVP was lower than that before treatment in the two groups ( P < @ , P < @ ) .
Method	The content of serum PGF@ in the observation group was decreased significantly compared with that in the control group ( P < @ ) and returned to the level of the normal group .
Conclusion	Body acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking achieves positive efficacy for menstrual headache and its mechanism could be related to regulating the abnormal levels of serum PGF@ and plasma AVP .

Problem	The current study investigated the effects of coaching as part of an emergent literacy professional development program to increase early childhood educators ' use of verbal references to print and phonological awareness during interactions with children .
Method	Thirty-one educators and @ children from each of their classrooms ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to an experimental group ( @ hr of in-service workshops plus @ coaching sessions ) and a comparison group ( workshops alone ) .
Method	The in-service workshops included instruction on how to talk about print and phonological awareness during a post-story craft/writing activity .
Method	All educators were video-recorded during a @-min craft/writing activity with a small group of preschoolers at pretest and posttest .
Method	All videotapes were transcribed and coded for verbal references to print and phonological awareness by the educators and children .
Result	Although at posttest , there were no significant group differences in the educators ' or the children 's references to print as measured by rate per minute , both the educators and the children in the experimental group used a significantly higher rate per minute of references to phonological awareness relative to the comparison group .
Conclusion	Professional development that included coaching with a speech-language pathologist enabled educators and children to engage in more phonological awareness talk during this activity .

Problem	The effects of hypoxic training on exercise performance remain controversial .
Problem	Here , we tested the hypotheses that i ) hypoxic training possesses ergogenic effects at sea level and altitude and ii ) the benefits are primarily mediated by improved mitochondrial function of the skeletal muscle .
Method	We determined aerobic performance ( incremental test to exhaustion and time trial for a set amount of work ) in moderately trained subjects undergoing @ wk of endurance training ( @-@ times per week , @ min per session ) in normoxia ( placebo , n = @ ) or normobaric hypoxia ( FIO@ = @ , n = @ ) using a double-blind and randomized design .
Method	Exercise tests were performed in normoxia and acute hypoxia ( FIO@ = @ ) .
Method	Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacities and electron coupling efficiencies were measured via high-resolution respirometry .
Method	Total hemoglobin mass was assessed by carbon monoxide rebreathing .
Result	Skeletal muscle respiratory capacity was not altered by training or hypoxia ; however , electron coupling control respective to fat oxidation slightly diminished with hypoxic training .
Result	Hypoxic training did increase total hemoglobin mass more than the placebo ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	In normoxia , hypoxic training had no additive effect on maximal measures of oxygen uptake or time trial performance .
Result	In acute hypoxia , hypoxic training conferred no advantage on maximal oxygen uptake but tended to enhance time trial performance more than normoxic training ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Our data suggest that , in moderately trained subjects , @ wk of hypoxic training possesses no ergogenic effect at sea level .
Conclusion	It is not excluded that hypoxic training might facilitate endurance capacity at moderate altitude ; however , this issue is still open and needs to be further examined .

Background	Breastfeeding has several advantages for both mother and child .
Background	Lactation consultants may promote prolonged breastfeeding , but little is known about their impact on the initiation of complementary feeding .
Method	Dietary intake during the initial complementary feeding period from @ to @ months was collected on mother-infant pairs who had unlimited access to lactation consultants along with those mother-infant pairs who received routine care at the well-baby clinics .
Method	The total duration of breastfeeding in each study population was also recorded , and total breastfeeding durations of infants receiving complementary foods from @ months and those exclusively breastfed for @ months in each of the two study populations were compared .
Result	Higher proportion of infants of mothers with unlimited access to lactation consultants were fed vegetable and vegetable pures ( p = @ ) and more than one food type ( p = @ ) at @ months .
Result	Furthermore , a lower percentage of them had three meals per day at @ months ( p = @ ) compared with those receiving routine care at the well-baby clinics .
Result	Infants exclusively breastfed for @ months all had similar duration of total breastfeeding .
Conclusion	Mother-infant pairs with unlimited access to lactation consultant had slower introduction of complementary foods at the initial complementary feeding period , according to number of infant 's meals at @ months of age .
Conclusion	Furthermore , those exclusively breastfed for @ months had more prolonged breastfeeding compared with mothers who began complementary feeding at @ months regardless of exposure to lactation consultants .

Method	Case-control study ; ecological study .
Problem	To examine the efficacy of wearing compression stockings to prevent muscle damage and to maintain running performance during a marathon competition .
Background	Exercise-induced muscle damage has been identified as one of the main causes of the progressive decrease in running and muscular performance found during marathon races .
Method	Thirty-four experienced runners were pair-matched for age , anthropometric data , and best race time in the marathon , and randomly assigned to a control group ( n = @ ) of runners who wore conventional socks or to a group of runners who wore foot-to-knee graduated compression stockings ( n = @ ) .
Method	Before and after the race , a sample of venous blood was obtained , and jump height and leg muscle power were measured during a countermovement jump .
Method	Serum myoglobin and creatine kinase concentrations were determined as blood markers of muscle fiber damage .
Result	Total race time was not different between the control group and the compression stockings group ( @ @ and @ @ minutes , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Result	Between the control group and the compression stockings group , postrace reductions in leg muscle power ( -@ % @ % versus -@ % @ % , respectively ; P = @ ) and jump height ( -@ % @ % versus -@ % .
Result	@ % , respectively ; P = @ ) were similar .
Result	At the end of the race , there were no differences between the control group and the compression stockings group in serum myoglobin ( @ @ ngmL ( -@ ) versus @ @ ngmL ( -@ ) , respectively ; P = @ ) and creatine kinase concentration ( @ @ UL ( -@ ) versus @ @ UL ( -@ ) , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The use of compression stockings did not improve running pace and did not prevent exercise-induced muscle damage during the marathon .
Conclusion	Wearing compression stockings during long-distance running events is an ineffective strategy to avoid the deleterious effects of muscle damage on running performance .
Method	Therapy , level @b .

Problem	Studies conducted in large populations of patients and providing full information on Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) antibiotic resistance are needed to determine the efficacy of sequential therapy ( SQT ) against this pathogen .
Problem	This study compared eradication rates with SQT and standard triple therapy ( STT ) , and evaluated the impact of antibiotic resistance on outcomes .
Method	The study population included adults with positive H. pylori culture presenting at four centers in China between March @ and December @ .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned to @ days of treatment with esomeprazole , amoxicillin , and clarithromycin ( STT ; n = @ ) or to @ days of treatment with esomeprazole and amoxicillin , followed by @ days of esomeprazole , clarithromycin , and tinidazole ( SQT ; n = @ ) .
Method	Eradication was assessed @-@ weeks after treatment .
Result	There was no significant difference between the eradication rates achieved with STT ( @ % ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ ) ) and SQT ( @ % ( @-@ @ ) ; P = @ ) in either the intention-to-treat analysis or the per-protocol analysis ( @ % ( @-@ @ ) and @ % ( @-@ @ ) , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Result	Clarithromycin resistance ( CLA-R , odds ratio ( OR ) = @ ( @-@ @ ) , P < @ ) and metronidazole resistance ( MET-R , OR = @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ ) both independently predicted treatment failure in the SQT group .
Result	Patients in the SQT group with dual CLA-R and MET-R had a lower eradication rate ( @ % ) than those with isolated CLA-R ( @ % , P = @ ) or isolated MET-R ( @ % , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	H. pylori eradication rates with STT and SQT were compromised by antibiotic resistance .
Conclusion	SQT may be suitable in regions with high prevalence of isolated CLA-R , but it is unsatisfactory when both CLA-R and MET-R are present .

Problem	Low dose computerised tomography ( CT ) screening for lung cancer can reduce lung-cancer-specific mortality .
Problem	The objective of this study was to analyse healthcare costs and healthcare utilisation of participants in the Danish lung cancer CT-screening trial ( DLCST ) .
Method	This registry study was nested in a randomised controlled trial ( DLCST ) .
Method	@ participants , current or former heavy smokers , aged @-@ years were randomised to five annual low dose CT scans or usual care during @-@ .
Method	Total healthcare costs and healthcare utilisation data for both the primary and the secondary healthcare sector were retrieved from public registries from randomisation - September @ and compared between ( @ ) the CT-screening group and the control group and , ( @ ) the control group and each of the true-positive , false-positive and true-negative groups .
Result	The median annual costs per participant were significantly higher in the CT-screening group ( Euros -LSB- EUR -RSB- @ , interquartile range -LSB- IQR -RSB- @-@ ) compared with the control group ( EUR @ , IQR @-@ ) ( p < @ ) .
Result	When the cost of the CT-screening programme was excluded , there was no longer a statistically significant difference between the CT-screening group ( EUR @ , IQR @-@ ) and the control group ( p = @ ) .
Result	Analyses according to the diagnostic groups showed that annual costs were @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) times higher for the true-positive and @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) times higher for the false-positive group compared with the control group .
Conclusion	Low dose lung cancer CT screening increases healthcare costs compared with no screening ; this difference was attributable to the costs of the CT-screening programme .
Conclusion	Overall healthcare costs were higher for the true-positive and false-positive groups than for the control group , also when excluding the cost of the CT-screening programme .
Conclusion	This increase was outweighed by the larger true-negative group showing no significant differences in costs compared with the control group .

Background	Hotel-based sex workers in Bangladesh have high rates of sexually transmissible infections ( STIs ) , high client turnover and low condom use .
Background	Two monthly clinic-based strategies were compared : periodic presumptive treatment ( PPT ) and enhanced syndromic management ( ESM ) - one round of presumptive treatment followed by treatment based on assessment and laboratory tests .
Method	A randomised controlled trial compared PPT and ESM by prevalence and incidence , behaviour , retention , cost and STI incidence and prevalence .
Method	Demographic , behavioural and clinical data were collected from women at two clinics in Dhaka .
Method	All women received presumptive treatment and were randomised to receive PPT or ESM at nine monthly visits .
Result	In total , @ women ( median age : < @ years ) were enrolled .
Result	At baseline , the prevalence of chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis ) and gonorrhoea ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae ) was @ % ( ESM : @ % ; PPT : @ % ) .
Result	After @ months , chlamydia and gonorrhoea decreased to @ % overall , ( ESM : @ % ; PPT : @ % ) .
Result	At each visit , @ % of women receiving ESM met the therapy criteria and were treated .
Result	Retention was low ( @ % ) .
Result	Total costs were @ % lower per visit for each woman for PPT ( ESM : $ @ v. PPT : $ @ ) .
Result	The number of sex work sessions was reduced from @ to @ ( P < @ ) , but income did not change .
Result	Coercion was reduced but condom use at last sex did not change significantly .
Conclusion	Monthly PPT and ESM were effective approaches for STI control .
Conclusion	PPT offered a feasible , low-cost alternative to ESM .
Conclusion	Educational aspects led to a reduction in coercion and fewer sessions .
Conclusion	Implementation studies are needed to improve condom use and retention .

Background	Use of hypotonic intravenous fluid to maintain hydration in children in hospital has been associated with hyponatraemia , leading to neurological morbidity and mortality .
Background	We aimed to assess whether use of fluid solutions with a higher sodium concentration reduced the risk of hyponatraemia compared with use of hypotonic solutions .
Method	We did a randomised controlled double-blind trial of children admitted to The Royal Children 's Hospital ( Melbourne , VIC , Australia ) who needed intravenous maintenance hydration for @ h or longer .
Method	With an online randomisation system that used unequal block sizes , we randomly assigned patients ( @:@ ) to receive either isotonic intravenous fluid containing @ mmol/L of sodium ( Na@ ) or hypotonic fluid containing @ mmol/L of sodium ( Na@ ) for @ h or until their intravenous fluid rate decreased to lower than @ % of the standard maintenance rate .
Method	We stratified assignment by baseline sodium concentrations .
Method	Study investigators , treating clinicians , nurses , and patients were masked to treatment assignment .
Method	The primary outcome was occurrence of hyponatraemia ( serum sodium concentration < @ mmol/L with a decrease of at least @ mmol/L from baseline ) during the treatment period , analysed by intention to treat .
Method	The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN@ .
Result	Between Feb @ , @ , and Jan @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ patients .
Result	Of these patients , primary outcome data were available for @ who received Na@ and @ who received Na@ .
Result	Fewer patients given Na@ than those given Na@ developed hyponatraemia ( @ patients -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
Result	No clinically apparent cerebral oedema occurred in either group .
Result	Eight patients in the Na@ group ( two potentially related to intravenous fluid ) and four in the Na@ group ( none related to intravenous fluid ) developed serious adverse events during the treatment period .
Result	One patient in the Na@ had seizures during the treatment period compared with seven who received Na@ .
Conclusion	Use of isotonic intravenous fluid with a sodium concentration of @ mmol/L had a lower risk of hyponatraemia without an increase in adverse effects than did fluid containing @ mmol/L of sodium .
Conclusion	An isotonic fluid should be used as intravenous fluid for maintenance hydration in children .

Background	The J-ROCKET AF study found that rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin with respect to the principal safety outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .
Background	The aim of this subgroup analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban and warfarin in relation to patient age .
Result	A total of @ % were elderly ( aged @ years ) .
Result	In elderly patients , the principal safety outcome occurred at @ % / year with rivaroxaban vs. @ % / year on warfarin ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @-@ @ ) , whereas the primary efficacy endpoint occurred at @ % / year vs. @ % / year ( HR , @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) , respectively .
Result	There were significant interactions in the principal safety outcomes of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin between the elderly and non-elderly groups , but not in the primary efficacy endpoints ( P = @ and @ for both interactions , respectively ) .
Result	Furthermore , in elderly patients , in the rivaroxaban group there was a trend to increase the principal safety outcome regardless of renal function .
Result	In elderly patients with preserved renal function , however , patients on rivaroxaban had a marginally favorable trend in the primary efficacy endpoint incidence rate compared with patients on warfarin .
Conclusion	There is a need to carefully consider the risks and benefits of therapy with rivaroxaban in elderly patients with non-valvular AF .

Background	Persistent muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction may be due to underlying activation failure and arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) .
Background	Knee-joint cryotherapy has been shown to improve quadriceps function transiently in those with AMI , thereby providing an opportunity to improve quadriceps muscle activation and strength in patients with a reconstructed ACL .
Problem	To compare quadriceps muscle function in patients with a reconstructed ACL who completed a @-week intervention including daily cryotherapy ( ice bag ) , daily exercises , or both .
Method	Cross-sectional study .
Method	Laboratory .
Method	A total of @ patients with reconstructed ACLs who were at least @ months post-index surgery and had measurable quadriceps AMI .
Method	The patients attended @ supervised visits over a @-week period .
Method	They were randomly assigned to receive @ minutes of knee-joint cryotherapy , @ hour of therapeutic rehabilitation exercises , or cryotherapy followed by exercises .
Method	We measured quadriceps Hoffmann reflex , normalized maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque , central activation ratio using the superimposed-burst technique , and patient-reported outcomes before and after the intervention period .
Result	After the @-week intervention period , patients who performed rehabilitation exercises immediately after cryotherapy had higher normalized maximal voluntary isometric contraction torques ( P = @ , Cohen d effect size = @ ) compared with those who received cryotherapy alone ( P = @ , d = @ ) or performed exercise alone ( P = @ , d = @ ) .
Conclusion	After ACL reconstruction , patients with AMI who performed rehabilitation exercises immediately after cryotherapy experienced greater strength gains than those who performed cryotherapy or exercises alone .

Background	Different types of exercises can help manage chronic neck pain .
Background	Supervised exercise interventions are widely used , but these protocols require substantial resources .
Background	The aim of this trial , which focused on adherence , was to evaluate two home exercise interventions .
Method	This parallel group randomized controlled trial included @ women randomly allocated into two groups - a strength training group ( STRENGTH , @ subjects ) and a stretching group ( STRETCH , @ subjects ) .
Method	The interventions focused on the neck and shoulder muscles and lasted for @ months .
Method	The STRENGTH group performed weight training and ended each session with stretching exercises .
Method	These stretching exercises constituted the entirety of the STRETCH group 's training session .
Method	Both groups were instructed to exercise three times per week .
Method	All the participants kept an exercise diary .
Method	In addition , all participants were offered support via phone and e-mail .
Method	The primary outcomes were pain intensity and function .
Method	The trial included a four - to six-month and a twelve-month follow-up .
Method	A completer in this study exercised at least @,@ times per week during eight unbroken weeks .
Method	A responder in this study reported clinically significant improvements on pain and function .
Method	The statistical analyses used the Mann Whitney U-test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test , and X@ test .
Result	At four - to six-months , the numbers of completers were @ in the STRENGTH group and @ in the STRETCH group .
Result	At twelve months , the corresponding numbers were @ ( STRENGTH ) and @ ( STRETCH ) .
Result	At four - to six-months , the proportions of subjects reporting clinically important changes ( STRENGTH and STRETCH ) were for neck pain : @ % and @ % , shoulder pain : @ % and @ % , function : @ % and @ % .
Result	At twelve months , the corresponding numbers were for neck pain : @ % and @ % , shoulder pain : @ % and @ % , function : @ % and @ % .
Conclusion	No differences in the two primary outcomes between the two interventions were found , a finding that may be due to the insufficient statistical power of the study .
Conclusion	Both interventions based on home exercises improved the two primary outcomes , but the adherences were relatively low .
Conclusion	Future studies should investigate ways to improve adherence to home exercise treatments .

Problem	Povidone iodine is used primarily as an antiseptic to decrease surgical site infection .
Problem	Its hemostatic and antiedematous properties in oral surgery also have been investigated recently .
Method	A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in @ patients undergoing mandibular third molar removal in a split-mouth design .
Method	In the study group , a povidone iodine solution with a concentration of @ mg/mL was used as the coolant and irrigant solution , whereas normal saline was used in the control group .
Method	Swelling ( orotragus and mentotragus distances ) , trismus ( maximum interincisal opening ) , and pain ( visual analog scale score ) were evaluated on postoperative days @ and @ .
Result	In the study group , a significant decrease in swelling and trismus was observed at the @ postoperative visits ( P = @ ) compared with the control group .
Result	The decrease of pain in the study group was not statistically significant at either postoperative visit ( P > @ ) .
Result	More patients ( @ % ) were subjectively satisfied with the side treated with povidone iodine .
Conclusion	Povidone iodine irrigation is an inexpensive and safe method to lessen the postoperative sequelae of third molar surgery .

Background	Cervical cancer is a frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide .
Background	Despite having easy preventive and therapeutic approaches , it is an important cause of mortality among women .
Method	The CRICERVA study is a cluster clinical trial which assigned one of three interventions to the target population registered in Cerdanyola , Barcelona .
Method	Among the @,@ resident women aged @ to @ years in the study area , women with no record of cervical cytology over the last three years were selected .
Method	The study included four arms : three interventions all including a pre-assigned date for screening visit and i ) personalized invitation letter ; ii ) adding to i ) an informative leaflet ; and , iii ) in addition to ii ) a personalized appointment reminder phone call , and iv ) no specific action taken ( control group ) .
Method	Participants were offered a personal interview about social-demographic characteristics and about screening attitudes .
Method	Cervical cytology and HPV DNA test ( HC@ ) were offered as screening tests .
Method	In the case of screening positive in any of these tests , the women were followed up until a full diagnosis could be obtained .
Method	The effect size of each study arm was estimated as the absolute gain in coverage between the original coverage and the final coverage .
Result	From the intervention groups ( @,@ women ) , we identified @,@ who were not appropriately screened , of which @,@ women answered the trial call and @,@ were amenable to screening .
Result	HPV was tested in @ women and cervical cytology in all @,@ .
Result	Overall , there was an absolute gain in coverage of @ % in the intervention groups compared to @ % in the control group .
Result	Coverage increased from @ % to @ % in strategy i ) ; from @ % to @ % in strategy ii ) and from @ % to @ % in strategy iii ) .
Result	Lack of information about the relevance of screening was the most important factor for not attending the screening program .
Conclusion	The study confirms that actively contacting women and including a date for a screening visit , notably increased participation in the screening program .
Conclusion	Efforts to improve health education in preventative activities are warranted .

Background	Fitzpatrick 's classification is the most common way of assessing skin UV sensitivity .
Background	The study aim was to investigate how self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity , as measured by phototest , are associated with attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection , as well as the correlation between self-estimated and actual UV sensitivity .
Method	A total of @ primary healthcare patients filled-out a questionnaire investigating attitudes towards sunbathing and the propensity to increase sun protection .
Method	They reported their skin type according to Fitzpatrick , and a UV sensitivity phototest was performed .
Result	Self-rated low UV sensitivity ( skin type III-VI ) was associated with a more positive attitude towards sunbathing and a lower propensity to increase sun protection , compared to high UV sensitivity .
Result	The correlation between the two methods was weak .
Conclusion	The findings might indicate that individuals with a perceived low but in reality high UV sensitivity do not seek adequate sun protection with regard to skin cancer risk .
Conclusion	Furthermore , the poor correlation between self-reported and actual UV sensitivity , measured by phototest , makes the clinical use of Fitzpatrick 's classification questionable .

Problem	Previous studies have demonstrated pronounced reduction of REM sleep on the first nights following major surgery which may influence pain , analgesic use , and recovery .
Problem	This placebo-controlled , randomized , double-blind study set out to evaluate the effect of zolpidem on sleep architecture in an elderly population undergoing fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty ( THA/TKA ) with length of stay < @ days .
Method	Twenty patients ( @ years ) undergoing THA or TKA in a standardized setup with spinal anesthesia and multimodal opioid-sparing postoperative analgesia were included .
Method	Polysomnography measures were performed for @ nights , @ night at home prior to surgery and on the first night after surgery , when the patient received placebo or zolpidem @ mg .
Method	Analgesic use , pain levels , and subjective measures of fatigue and sleep quality were recorded .
Method	Analysis of sleep data was performed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual .
Result	Objective sleep data did not show a significant difference between groups in any of the sleep stages .
Result	However , subjective data on sleep quality and fatigue showed significantly less fatigue and better sleep quality in the zolpidem group ( p < @ ) , and reduced objectively recorded number of arousals ( p = @ ) .
Result	Levels of pain and opioid use were similar in the @ groups .
Conclusion	Our objective data did not support the primary hypothesis that one night 's treatment with zolpidem would significantly improve sleep architecture following major surgery , although there was improved feeling of sleep quality and fatigue associated with fewer postoperative arousals .

Background	Long-term sick leave has considerably negative impact on the individual and society .
Background	Hence , the need to identify effective occupational rehabilitation programs is pressing .
Background	In Norway , group based occupational rehabilitation programs merging patients with different diagnoses have existed for many years , but no rigorous evaluation has been performed .
Background	The described randomized controlled trial aims primarily to compare two structured multicomponent inpatient rehabilitation programs , differing in length and content , with a comparative cognitive intervention .
Background	Secondarily the two inpatient programs will be compared with each other , and with a usual care reference group .
Method	The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups .
Method	The Social Security Office performs monthly extractions of sick listed individuals aged @-@ years , on sick leave @-@ months , with sick leave status @ % - @ % due to musculoskeletal , mental or unspecific disorders .
Method	Sick-listed persons are randomized twice : @ ) to receive one of two invitations to participate in the study or not receive an invitation , where the latter `` untouched '' control group will be monitored for future sick leave in the National Social Security Register , and @ ) after inclusion , to a Long or Short inpatient multicomponent rehabilitation program ( depending on which invitation was sent ) or an outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy group comparative program .
Method	The Long program consists of @ weeks with full rehabilitation days .
Method	The Short program consists of @ +@ full days , separated by two weeks , in which a workplace visit will be performed if desirable .
Method	Three areas of rehabilitation are targeted : mental training , physical training and work-related problem solving .
Method	The primary outcome is number of sick leave days .
Method	Secondary outcomes include time until full sustainable return to work , health related quality of life , health related behavior , functional status , somatic and mental health , and perceptions of work .
Method	In addition , health economic evaluation will be performed , and the implementation of the interventions , expectations and experiences of users and service providers will be investigated with different qualitative methods .

Problem	To study the clinical effect of development theory based acupuncture on early cerebral palsy ( CP ) infants with parafunctional sitting position .
Method	Totally @ early CP infants were randomly assigned to two groups equally , the treatment group and the control group .
Method	All received acupuncture combined with training rehabilitation .
Method	Patients in the treatment group adopted acupuncture based on infants development theory , while those in the control group were treated by head acupuncture .
Method	Sitting functional points in Gross motor function measure ( GMFM ) @ were observed in different groups and infant patients of various types before and after treatment .
Method	Root mean square ( RMS ) signals of sitting correlated muscles ( latissimus dorsi , erector spinae , rectus abdominis ) were recorded by surface electromyography ( sEMG ) .
Method	The effective rate was evaluated by Nimodipine method .
Result	Compared with before treatment , sitting functional points were significantly improved in the two groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	After treatment , it was higher in the treatment group than in the control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	The advance amplitude was higher in CP infants of the spastic type and the hypotonic type than other types ( P < @ ) .
Result	Along with sitting process , latissimus dorsi RMS signals were gradually tapered , erector spinae RMS signals were gradually enhanced , and rectus abdominis RMS signals were slightly weakened .
Result	Compared with the control group , latissimus dorsi RMS signals obviously decreased , and erector spinae RMS signals obviously increased in the treatment group after treatment ( all P < @ ) .
Result	The total effective rate was higher in the treatment group than in the control group ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Infants development theory based acupuncture could effectively elevate dorsi-extensor muscles force , improve sitting position of @ months to @ year old CP infants with parafunctional sitting position .

Background	Emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity .
Background	Yet , empirical evidence for individual ( trait ) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal .
Problem	The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake .
Problem	It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .
Method	Participants ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions ( sad/neutral ) .
Method	Attentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli .
Method	Self-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( DEBQ ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer .
Result	Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition .
Result	Yet , attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition , but not in the sad mood condition .
Conclusion	The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating ( based on the DEBQ ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad , at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women .
Conclusion	Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state , and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general , but maybe not during sad mood .

Problem	Sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca ( @ + ) - handling proteins play an important role in myocardial dysfunction after acute ischemia/reperfusion injury .
Problem	We hypothesized that nitrite would improve postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction by increasing nitric oxide ( NO ) generation and that the mechanism of this protection is related to the modulation of SR Ca ( @ + ) - handling proteins .
Method	We conducted a randomized prospective animal study using male Sprague-Dawley rats .
Method	Cardiac arrest was induced by intravenous bolus of potassium chloride ( @ g/g ) .
Method	Nitrite ( @ nmol/g ) or placebo was administered when chest compression was started .
Method	No cardiac arrest was induced in the sham group .
Method	Hemodynamic parameters were monitored invasively for @ minutes after the return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) .
Method	Echocardiogram was performed to evaluate cardiac function .
Method	Myocardial samples were harvested @ minutes and @ hour after ROSC .
Result	Myocardial function was significantly impaired in the nitrite and placebo groups after resuscitation , whereas cardiac function ( i.e. , ejection fraction and fractional shortening ) was significantly greater in the nitrite group than in the placebo group .
Result	Nitrite administration increased the level of nitric oxide in the myocardium @ min after resuscitation compared to the other two groups .
Result	The levels of phosphorylated phospholamban ( PLB ) were decreased after resuscitation , and nitrite increased the phosphorylation of phospholamban compared to the placebo .
Result	No significant differences were found in the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ( @ + ) ATPase ( SERCA@a ) and ryanodine receptors ( RyRs ) .
Conclusion	postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is associated with the impairment of PLB phosphorylation .
Conclusion	Nitrite administered during resuscitation improves postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction by preserving phosphorylated PLB protein during resuscitation .

Problem	This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects on glycemic control of a diabetes care program focusing on case management and to discuss challenges in the quality of diabetes care in Taiwan .
Method	We randomized @,@ study subjects recruited from the Diabetes Management through an Integrated Delivery System project in @-@ into intervention ( n = @ from @ clinics ) and control ( n = @ from @ clinics ) groups .
Method	The quarterly self-care and nutrition-education program in the intervention group was delivered by case managers , and standard care was provided to the control group .
Method	The intervention program was conducted during @-@ .
Method	A multivariate mixed model analysis was used to assess the @-year intervention effects on glycemic control .
Result	Glycated hemoglobin ( HbA@c ) level in the intervention group ( especially for those with a baseline HbA@c level of @-@ % and > @ % ) was significantly lower than that in the control group @ months after recruitment and remained lower through the subsequent three intervention years .
Conclusion	The current findings provide evidence that case management provided in the pay-for-performance ( P@P ) diabetes care program in Taiwan was effective at improving glycemic control for at least @ years .
Conclusion	However , previous research indicated poverty is associated with not only higher diabetes incidence but also inequality of diabetes care in Taiwan despite universal health coverage .
Conclusion	Those with a more severe condition were less likely to be enrolled in the P@P diabetes care program .
Conclusion	Additional cost-effectiveness studies and more health policy reforms are needed to optimize diabetes care in Taiwan .

Background	Positive-pressure ventilation during transport of intubated patients is generally delivered via a hand-pressurized device .
Background	Of these devices , self-inflating resuscitators ( SIR ) and flow-inflating resuscitators ( FIR ) constitute the two major types used .
Background	Selection of a particular device for transport , however , remains largely an institutional practice .
Problem	To evaluate the hypothesis that transport ventilation goals of intubated pediatric patients are better achieved using an FIR compared to an SIR .
Method	This randomized crossover simulation study compared the performance of SIR and FIR among anesthesia providers in a pediatric transport scenario .
Method	Subjects hand-ventilated a test lung while simultaneously maneuvering a stretcher bed to simulate patient transport .
Method	Hand ventilation was carried out using a Jackson-Rees circuit ( FIR ) and a Laerdal pediatric silicone resuscitator ( SIR ) .
Method	The primary outcome was the proportion of total breaths delivered within the predefined target PIP/PEEP range ( @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ cm H@O ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes included proportion of total breaths delivered with operationally defined unacceptable breath variables ( PIP > @ cm H@O or PEEP < @ cm H@O ) .
Result	Overall , participants were four times more likely to deliver target breaths and one-third less likely to deliver unacceptable breaths using the FIR compared to the SIR .
Result	When comparing device performance , a @ % increase in the proportions of target breaths and a @ % decrease in unacceptable breaths using the FIR were observed ( P < @ for both ) .
Conclusion	Hand ventilation during patient transport is superior using the FIR compared to the SIR to achieve target ventilatory goals and avoid unacceptable ventilatory cycles .

Background	Hip fractures are a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide , and the number of hip fractures is expected to rise to over @ million per year by @ .
Background	The optimal approach for the surgical management of displaced femoral neck fractures remains unknown .
Background	Current evidence suggests the use of arthroplasty ; however , there is lack of evidence regarding whether patients with displaced femoral neck fractures experience better outcomes with total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) or hemiarthroplasty ( HA ) .
Background	The HEALTH trial compares outcomes following THA versus HA in patients @years of age or older with displaced femoral neck fractures .
Method	HEALTH is a multicentre , randomised controlled trial where @ patients , @years of age or older , with displaced femoral neck fractures from international sites are randomised to receive either THA or HA .
Method	Exclusion criteria include associated major injuries of the lower extremity , hip infection ( s ) and a history of frank dementia .
Method	The primary outcome is unplanned secondary procedures and the secondary outcomes include functional outcomes , patient quality of life , mortality and hip-related complications-both within @years of the initial surgery .
Method	We are using minimisation to ensure balance between intervention groups for the following factors : age , prefracture living , prefracture functional status , American Society for Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Class and centre number .
Method	Data analysts and the HEALTH Steering Committee are blinded to the surgical allocation throughout the trial .
Method	Outcome analysis will be performed using a ( @ ) test ( or Fisher 's exact test ) and Cox proportional hazards modelling estimate .
Method	All results will be presented with @ % CIs .
Background	The HEALTH trial has received local and McMaster University Research Ethics Board ( REB ) approval ( REB # : @-@ ) .
Result	Outcomes from the primary manuscript will be disseminated through publications in academic journals and presentations at relevant orthopaedic conferences .
Result	We will communicate trial results to all participating sites .
Result	Participating sites will communicate results with patients who have indicated an interest in knowing the results .

Problem	To evaluate the occurrence of reflux from the great saphenous vein by color Doppler ultrasonography in subjects undergoing treatment of insufficiency of the saphenofemoral junction by simple ligation or ligation with section of the saphenous arch .
Method	We performed @ operations ( in @ subjects ) of varicose insufficiency of the saphenofemoral junction ( SFJ ) , belonging to the CEAP clinical classification of @-@ , who were randomly divided into two groups .
Method	A group called C , with ligature and section of the saphenous arch , and a group called L , with simple ligation of the saphenous vein and no sectioning of its arch .
Method	We then investigated the occurrence of reflux from the great saphenous vein in groups C and L through postoperative color Doppler ultrasonography at intervals of six months to one year .
Result	Of the @ members submitted to the approach of the saphenous arch , @ were evaluated by postoperative doppler ultrasound , since two subjects ( three limbs ) did not return and were excluded from the study .
Result	The mean age was @ years , with @ % females and predominance of CEAP classification @ in @ % .
Result	Of the @ operations for the treatment of reflux of the saphenous arch , @ % had reflux postoperatively ,@ % in group C and @ % in group L ( p < @,@ ) .
Result	The relative risk of reflux of the saphenous arch in group L was @ times higher compared with group C.
Conclusion	the section of the arch of the great saphenous vein causes less postoperative reflux than simple ligation in treatment of insufficiency of the great saphenous vein .

Problem	We examined whether the addition of another conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) to methotrexate ( MTX ) upon infliximab ( IFX ) discontinuation in well-controlled rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients could suppress subsequent disease flare .
Method	RA patients maintaining DAS@-CRP ( Disease Activity Score of @ joints with C-reactive protein ) scores < @ for @ months with IFX were randomized either to receive addition of bucillamine ( BUC ) to MTX ( BUC + MTX group ; n = @ ) or not ( MTX group ; n = @ ) upon discontinuing IFX .
Method	The primary endpoint was the flare rate within @ years of IFX discontinuation .
Result	Six patients discontinuing MTX during the study were excluded from analyses .
Result	Seventeen patients ( @ % ) experienced flares in the MTX group , which was significantly reduced in the BUC + MTX group ( @ % ; p = @ ) .
Result	Further , the flare rates differed significantly between remission and non-remission by a Boolean definition upon IFX discontinuation in the MTX group ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) , but they were comparable in the BUC + MTX group .
Result	BUC treatment was interrupted in seven patients due to rash , proteinuria and incompliance .
Conclusion	DMARDs combination therapy may be a better treatment strategy than MTX monotherapy for maintaining RA control after successful discontinuation of biological agents .

Background	Diet and lifestyle modification is commonly used in constipation management .
Background	As there is a dearth of studies on this topic in Malaysia , we aim to elucidate the relations between stool patterns , dietary intake and physical activity levels among adults with functional constipation .
Method	From a database collected via surveys at public events , a convenience sample of @ adults diagnosed with Rome II-defined functional constipation was enrolled in this cross-sectional study .
Method	After severity assessment using the Chinese Constipation Questionnaire , subjects completed @-week bowel movement diaries to determine stool frequency , consistency and output .
Method	Dietary intake and physical activity levels were assessed twice using three-day @-hour diet recalls and International Physical Activity Questionnaire , respectively .
Method	Ninety subjects who completed the study were included in the analysis .
Result	Mean weekly stool frequency was @ + / - @ times , consistency score was @ + / - @ ( range @-@ @ ) , output was @ + / - @ balls ( @ mm diameter ) and severity score was @ + / - @ ( range @-@ @ ) .
Result	Mean daily dietary intakes were : energy @,@ + / - @kcal , dietary fibre @ + / - @ g and fluid @ + / - @ L.
Result	The majority of subjects were physically inactive .
Result	Stool frequency and output were positively associated with dietary fibre ( r ( s ) = @ , P < @ ; r ( s ) = @ , P < @ ) and fluid intake ( r ( s ) = @ , P < @ ; OR = @ , @ % CI -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
Result	Constipation severity was associated with higher physical activity levels ( OR = @ , @ % CI -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
Conclusion	Insufficient intake of dietary fibre and fluid are associated with aggravated constipation symptoms .
Conclusion	Further studies are necessary to confirm usefulness of dietary intervention in treatment of constipation as dietary factors alone may not influence overall severity and stool consistency , an integral element of constipation .

Problem	To assess whether medical record documentation reflects actual home practices regarding the administration of preventive medications to urban children with persistent asthma .
Method	Baseline data from a prompting asthma intervention were used for this cross-sectional analysis .
Method	As part of the larger study , we enrolled children ( @-@ years ) with persistent asthma in the waiting room at @ primary care offices ( @-@ ) .
Method	Prior to their visit with a healthcare provider , caregivers reported information regarding their child 's asthma symptom severity and current preventive medications ( i.e. name and frequency of use ) .
Method	We compared caregiver-reported medication information with medical record data to determine the rate of complete concordance , defined as total consistency between the prescribed medication data documented in the medical record and parent report describing how the child is actually using the medication at home .
Result	According to @ completed medical record reviews , @ ( @ % ) children had a current prescription for a daily preventive asthma medication .
Result	Of these children , @ ( @ % ) had caregivers who reported complete concordance .
Result	Those reporting complete concordance were more likely to have children with greater symptom severity , including fewer symptom-free days in the prior two weeks ( @ vs. @ , p = @ ) , and @ asthma-related hospitalization in the prior year ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Medical records may poorly reflect actual home practices and providers should specifically inquire about medication use and barriers to adherence at the time of an office visit to promote guideline-based , consistent treatment for children with persistent asthma .

Problem	To determine if supervised exercise minimises treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) .
Problem	This is the first study to date that has investigated the potential role of exercise in preventing ADT toxicity rather than recovering from established toxicities .
Method	Sixty-three men scheduled to receive ADT were randomly assigned to a @-month supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise sessions commenced within @ days of their first ADT injection ( @ men ) or usual care ( @ men ) .
Method	The primary outcome was body composition ( lean and fat mass ) .
Method	Other study outcomes included bone mineral density , physical function , blood biomarkers of chronic disease risk and bone turnover , general and prostate cancer-specific quality of life , fatigue and psychological distress .
Method	Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values .
Result	Compared to usual care , a @-month exercise programme preserved appendicular lean mass ( P = @ ) and prevented gains in whole body fat mass , trunk fat mass and percentage fat with group differences of -@ kg ( P = @ ) , -@ kg ( P = @ ) and -@ % ( P < @ ) , respectively .
Result	Significant between-group differences were also seen favouring the exercise group for cardiovascular fitness ( peak oxygen consumption @ mL/kg/min , P = @ ) , muscular strength ( @-@ @ kg , P @ ) , lower body function ( -@ s , P < @ ) , total cholesterol : high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio ( -@ , P = @ ) , sexual function ( @ , P = @ ) , fatigue ( @ , P = @ ) , psychological distress ( -@ , P = @ ) , social functioning ( @ , P = @ ) and mental health ( @-@ @ , P @ ) .
Result	There were no significant group differences for any other outcomes .
Conclusion	Commencing a supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise when initiating ADT significantly reduced treatment toxicity , while improving social functioning and mental health .
Conclusion	Concurrent prescription of supervised exercise when initiating ADT is therefore advised to minimise morbidity associated with severe hypogonadism .

Problem	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous iron versus placebo added to standard oral iron therapy in the treatment of severe postpartum anaemia .
Method	A randomised , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in a single centre .
Method	Hospital Clinic of Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain .
Method	A cohort of @ women with severe postpartum anaemia ( @-@ @ g/dl ) treated with oral ferrous sulphate ( two tablets of @mg ) .
Method	Women were randomised to receive either intravenous ferrous sucrose ( @mg/@hours for two consecutive days ) or intravenous placebo , in addition to standard iron therapy .
Method	Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at @ , @ , and @weeks .
Method	Haemoglobin and haematocrit at @ , @ , and @weeks .
Method	Other haematological and clinical parameters , psychological status , and adverse side effects were also evaluated .
Result	Haemoglobin and haematocrit values were comparable in women receiving intravenous iron or placebo in addition to oral iron therapy at any of the time points .
Result	At @weeks , haemoglobin level ( meanSD ) was @ versus @ g/dl , with a mean difference of -@ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) , in the placebo and in the intravenous iron groups , respectively .
Result	No differences were found between clinical symptoms of anaemia , psychological status , and adverse side effects between groups .
Conclusion	Intravenous iron added to oral iron therapy did not show significant benefits over placebo , neither in haemoglobin rise nor in symptoms or adverse side effects .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of orally administered propranolol versus prednisolone versus both in the treatment of potentially disfiguring or functionally threatening infantile hemangiomas .
Method	A prospective study of @ patients aged @ week-@ months was randomized into three equal groups .
Method	These were as follows : A , propranolol ( @-@ mg/kg/d ) ; B , prednisolone ( @-@ mg/kg/d ) ; and C , receiving both for a minimum duration of @ months .
Method	Dimensions , color , consistency , ultrasonography , photographic documentation based on Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) were recorded before and periodically after starting treatment .
Method	A minimum @ % improvement was considered as success with no regrowth up to @ month of stopping treatment .
Result	Mean initial response time ( days ) in A ( @ SD ) and C ( @ SD ) was significantly lower than B ( @ SD ) ( p < @ ) .
Result	Significant change in consistency was noted very early in A ( @ hours ) compared to B and C ( @ days ) .
Result	VAS results are as follows : ( a ) color fading -- significant reduction in A within @ hours compared to B and C ( p = @ ) , ( b ) flattening -- more significant and earlier in A and C than B ( p < @ ) , and ( c ) mean reduction in size : significant in A and C at @ months ( p = @ , p = @ ) , @ months ( p = @ , p = @ ) , @ months ( p = @ , p = @ ) , and @ months ( p = @ , p = @ ) , whereas in B , it was seen only at @ months ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Propranolol had a consistent , rapid therapeutic effect compared to prednisolone .
Conclusion	A combination of the two had a comparable but not higher efficacy than propranolol alone .
Conclusion	Prednisolone was associated with a higher number of complications , thereby decreasing patient compliance .

Problem	To evaluate the therapeutic effect on pain in the dressing change after perianal abscess surgery treated with warm suspending moxibustion at Changqiang ( GV @ ) .
Method	One hundred and sixty patients were randomized into a moxibustion group and a far-infrared therapy group , @ cases in each one .
Method	In the moxibustion group , the warm suspending moxibustion at Changqiang ( GV @ ) was applied .
Method	In the far-infrared therapy group , the infrared ray was radiated at Changqiang ( GV @ ) .
Method	The treatment started in @ min after dressing change in the two groups .
Method	Totally , @ treatments were required .
Method	The time requirement being equal to or less than @ score in the assessment face scale ( AFS ) , the case number of pain relief in @ min after treatment and the intention of the two therapies after everyday dressing change were observed in the patients of the two groups .
Result	In the moxibustion group , the time of pain relief was shorter than that of the far-infrared therapy group -LSB- ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @st day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @nd day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @rd day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @th day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @th day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @th day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @th day ; ( @ + / - @ ) min vs ( @ + / - @ ) min on the @th day , all P < @ -RSB- .
Result	The case numbers of pain relief in @ min after treatment were @ cases , @ cases , @ cases and @ cases from the @st to the @th day separately in the moxibustion group , which were much more than @ cases , @ cases , @ cases and @ cases in the far-infrared therapy group ( all P < @ ) .
Result	The treatment intention scores in the moxibustion group were better than those in the far-infrared therapy group ( all P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The warm suspending moxibustion at Changqiang ( GV @ ) relieves pain rapidly in the dressing change of much more patients after perianal abscess surgery in much shorter time as compared with the far-infrared therapy .
Conclusion	Moreover , the patients have more expectation to be treated with moxibustion therapy .

Background	The Feedback Intervention Trial was a national trial of an intervention to increase hand hygiene behavior in English and Welsh hospitals .
Background	It significantly improved behavior , the effect increasing with fidelity to intervention , but the intervention proved more difficult to implement than anticipated .
Background	This study aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementation as experienced by those who delivered the intervention .
Method	Semistructured interviews were conducted with @ intervention ward coordinators implementing the intervention .
Method	Interview questions were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework .
Method	Text relating to each domain was scored according to whether it indicated low or high likelihood of implementation , and thematic analysis conducted .
Result	The lowest scoring domains were `` environmental context and resources , '' `` beliefs about capabilities , '' `` social influences , '' and `` emotion . ''
Result	Lack of time and understaffing , perceived negativity from other staff members , and stress were identified as challenges to implementation .
Result	The highest scoring domains were `` behavioral regulation , '' `` motivation , '' `` skills , '' `` knowledge , '' and `` professional role . ''
Result	Ward coordinators reported that they had the skills , understanding , and motivation to implement the intervention and spoke of consistency of tasks with existing roles .
Conclusion	Implementation might be improved by giving designated time for intervention tasks and ensuring that the ward coordinator role is allocated to staff for whom tasks are commensurate with existing professional roles .

Background	Millions of children worldwide suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms and other mental health problems due to repeated exposure to war or organized violence .
Background	Forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) are the most commonly used treatment for PTSD and appear to be effective for children as well , but little is known about the mechanisms of change through which they achieve their effectiveness .
Background	Here we present the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) studying the effectiveness and mechanisms of change of Narrative Exposure Therapy ( NET ) , a CBT-based , manualized , short-term intervention for PTSD symptoms resulting from repeated traumatization , in immigrant children traumatized by war .
Method	We are conducting a multicentre , pragmatic RCT in a usual care setting .
Method	Up to @ @-@-year-old immigrant children who have experienced war and suffer from PTSD symptoms will be randomized into intervention ( NET ) and control ( treatment as usual , TAU ) groups of equal sizes .
Method	The effectiveness of NET treatment will be compared to both a waiting list and the parallel TAU positive control group , on the primary outcomes of PTSD and depressive symptoms , psychological distress , resilience , and level of cognitive performance .
Method	The effects of the intervention on traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions will be studied as potential mechanisms of change mediating overall treatment effectiveness .
Method	The possible moderating effects of peritraumatic dissociation , level of cognitive performance , and gender on treatment effectiveness will also be considered .
Method	We hypothesize that NET will be more effective than a waitlist condition or TAU in reducing PTSD and other symptoms and improving resilience , and that these effects will be mediated by changes in traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions .
Conclusion	The results of this trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of NET in treating trauma-related symptoms in immigrant children affected by war .
Conclusion	The trial will also generate insights into the complex relationships between PTSD , memory functions , posttraumatic cognitions and cognitive performance in children , and help guide the future development and implementation of therapeutic interventions for PTSD in children .

Background	This study is a European multicentre , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of nilvadipine as a disease course modifying treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) in a phase III study that will run for a period of @weeks with a treatment period of @weeks .
Method	Adult patients , males and females over @years with mild-to-moderate AD as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer 's disease and Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS-ADRDA ) criteria , will be included in the study .
Method	It aims to recruit a total of @ patients with AD ; @ in the nilvadipine group and @ in the placebo group .
Method	Participants will be randomised to receive nilvadipine , an @mg overencapsulated , sustained release capsule , or a matching overencapsulated placebo ( sugar pill ) for a period of @weeks of treatment .
Method	The primary efficacy outcome measure in this study is the change in cognitive function as assessed by the Alzheimer 's disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS-Cog @ ) from baseline to the end of treatment duration ( @weeks ) .
Method	There are two key secondary outcome measures , the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes ( CDR-sb ) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia ( DAD ) .
Method	If a statistically significant effect is seen in the primary outcome , CDR-sb will be considered to be a coprimary end point and only the DAD will contribute to the secondary outcome analysis .

Background	Mental and physical fatigue while at work is common among emergency medical services ( EMS ) shift workers .
Background	Extended shifts ( for example @ hours ) and excessive amounts of overtime work increase the likelihood of negative safety outcomes and pose a challenge for EMS fatigue-risk management .
Background	Text message-based interventions are a potentially high-impact , low-cost platform for sleep and fatigue assessment and distributing information to workers at risk of negative safety outcomes related to sleep behaviors and fatigue .
Method	We will conduct a pilot randomized trial with a convenience sample of adult EMS workers recruited from across the United States using a single study website .
Method	Participants will be allocated to one of two possible arms for a @-day study period .
Method	The intervention arm will involve text message assessments of sleepiness , fatigue , and difficulty with concentration at the beginning , during , and end of scheduled shifts .
Method	Intervention subjects reporting high levels of sleepiness or fatigue will receive one of four randomly selected intervention messages promoting behavior change during shiftwork .
Method	Control subjects will receive assessment only text messages .
Method	We aim to determine the performance characteristics of a text messaging tool for the delivery of a sleep and fatigue intervention .
Method	We seek to determine if a text messaging program with tailored intervention messages is effective at reducing perceived sleepiness and/or fatigue among emergency medicine clinician shift workers .
Method	Additional aims include testing whether a theory-based behavioral intervention , delivered by text message , changes ` alertness behaviors ' .
Conclusion	The SleepTrackTXT pilot trial could provide evidence of compliance and effectiveness that would support rapid widespread expansion in one of two forms : @ ) a stand-alone program in the form of a tailored/individualized sleep monitoring and fatigue reduction support service for EMS workers ; or @ ) an add-on to a multi-component fatigue risk management program led and maintained by employers or by safety and risk management services .

Problem	To assess the efficacy of a financial incentive added to routine specialist pregnancy stop smoking services versus routine care to help pregnant smokers quit .
Method	Phase II therapeutic exploratory single centre , individually randomised controlled parallel group superiority trial .
Method	One large health board area with a materially deprived , inner city population in the west of Scotland , United Kingdom .
Method	@ self reported pregnant smokers in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde who were English speaking , at least @ years of age , less than @ weeks pregnant , and had an exhaled carbon monoxide breath test result of @ ppm or more .
Method	@ women were randomised to incentives and @ to control .
Method	The control group received routine care , which was the offer of a face to face appointment to discuss smoking and cessation and , for those who attended and set a quit date , the offer of free nicotine replacement therapy for @ weeks provided by pharmacy services , and four , weekly support phone calls .
Method	The intervention group received routine care plus the offer of up to @ of shopping vouchers : @ for attending a face to face appointment and setting a quit date ; then another @ if at four weeks ' post-quit date exhaled carbon monoxide confirmed quitting ; a further @ was provided for continued validated abstinence of exhaled carbon monoxide after @ weeks ; a final @ voucher was provided for validated abstinence of exhaled carbon monoxide at @-@ weeks ' gestation .
Method	The primary outcome was cotinine verified cessation at @-@ weeks ' gestation through saliva ( < @ ng/mL ) or urine ( < @ ng/mL ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes included birth weight , engagement , and self reported quit at four weeks .
Result	Recruitment was extended from @ to @ months to achieve the target sample size .
Result	Follow-up continued until September @ .
Result	Of the @ women randomised , three controls opted out soon after enrolment ; these women did not want their data to be used , leaving @ intervention and @ control group participants in the intention to treat analysis .
Result	No harms of financial incentives were documented .
Result	Significantly more smokers in the incentives group than control group stopped smoking : @ ( @ % ) versus @ ( @ % ) .
Result	The relative risk of not smoking at the end of pregnancy was @ ( @ % confidence interval @ to @ ) P < @ .
Result	The absolute risk difference was @ % ( @ % confidence interval @ % to @ % ) .
Result	The number needed to treat ( where financial incentives need to be offered to achieve one extra quitter in late pregnancy ) was @ ( @ % confidence interval @ to @ ) .
Result	The mean birth weight was @ g ( SD @ g ) in the incentives group and @ ( SD @ ) g in the control group ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	This phase II randomised controlled trial provides substantial evidence for the efficacy of incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy ; as this was only a single centre trial , incentives should now be tested in different types of pregnancy cessation services and in different parts of the United Kingdom .

Problem	Motor learning results in changes of movement representation in primary motor cortex ( M@ ) a process involving long-term potentiation ( LTP ) .
Problem	Pairing motor training with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) of M@ enhances the formation of a motor memory .
Problem	Here we determined the effect of pairing M@ stimulation and the execution of training movements at different times and frequencies on the formation of a motor memory .
Method	Formation of a motor memory was defined as increases in motor evoked potentials ( MEP ) of the training agonist ( extensor carpi ulnaris muscle , ECU ) and increases in peak acceleration of the trained movements that last more than @min .
Method	Training consisted of auditory-paced ballistic wrist extension movements ( @min , @ Hz ) paired with @ , @ or @ Hz subthreshold rTMS .
Method	The rTMS pulse was applied at either the onset , @ms prior to or @ms after the onset of training movement related increases in electromyographic ( EMG ) activity of ECU .
Method	This was compared to a Sham condition .
Result	Only @ Hz rTMS applied at the onset of the training related increase in ECU-EMG activity resulted in increases in MEP amplitudes and peak acceleration when compared to the Sham .
Conclusion	The formation of motor memory is enhanced above the nave level by co-administration of low frequency rTMS at the time of execution of training movements .
Conclusion	These results indicate the importance of time and frequency of rTMS in these settings and should be considered in the design of rehabilitation treatment strategies using rTMS .

Background	Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension , inflammation , and increased cardiovascular risk .
Background	Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) reduces blood pressure , but adherence is often suboptimal , and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain .
Background	Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea , we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk .
Method	We conducted a randomized , controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices .
Method	Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire , and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis .
Method	Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of @ to @ events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone ( the control group ) or , in addition to education , either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen .
Method	Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after @ weeks of the study treatment .
Method	The primary outcome was @-hour mean arterial pressure .
Result	Of @ patients who underwent randomization , @ ( @ % ) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up .
Result	On average , the @-hour mean arterial pressure at @ weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group ( -@ mm Hg ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen ( -@ mm Hg ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant difference in the @-hour mean arterial pressure between the control group and the group receiving oxygen .
Result	A sensitivity analysis performed with the use of multiple imputation approaches to assess the effect of missing data did not change the results of the primary analysis .
Conclusion	In patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors , the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP , but not nocturnal supplemental oxygen , resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure .
Conclusion	( Funded by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute and others ; HeartBEAT ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	Orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) has become the therapeutic option of choice for end-stage liver disease .
Background	The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of splenic morphology , signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values and explore their value in evaluating the therapeutic effects of orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) on portal hypertension at @ Tesla MRI .
Method	Twenty patients with portal hypertension undergoing OLT were included in this study .
Method	Conventional MRI and diffusion-weighted image ( DWI ) ( b value = @ s/mm ( @ ) ) sequences were applied on each patient before and after OLT , and these patients were referred to as the preoperative and postoperative groups .
Method	Twenty healthy individuals were selected as the normal group .
Method	After image acquisition , the splenic width ( W ) , thickness ( T ) , length ( L ) , the diameter of the portal vein ( PD ) and splenic vein ( SD ) were measured and the splenic volume ( V ) was calculated .
Method	The SNR and CNR were measured on T@WI .
Method	The ADC maps were calculated using the b@ in DWIs and the ADC values were measured .
Result	Compared with the preoperative group , the splenic V , PD and SD decreased significantly in the postoperative group ( P < @ ) .
Result	All splenic morphological values were significantly different between preoperative and normal groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	The splenic L and V were significantly different ( P < @ ) between postoperative and normal groups .
Result	The SNR and CNR values were @ @ and @ @ , @ @ and @ @ , @ @ and @ @ in the preoperative , postoperative and normal groups , respectively .
Result	Both SNR and CNR decreased after OLT , but they was still higher than the normal values .
Result	The SNR was significantly different between any two groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	The CNR was significantly different ( P < @ ) between the preoperative and postoperative groups , preoperative and normal groups .
Result	The splenic ADC values were ( @ @ ) @ ( -@ ) mm ( @ ) / s , ( @ @ ) @ ( -@ ) mm ( @ ) / s and ( @ @ ) @ ( -@ ) mm ( @ ) / s in the preoperative , postoperative and normal groups , respectively .
Result	The difference of ADC values were significant ( P < @ ) between the preoperative and postoperative groups , and the preoperative and normal groups .
Conclusion	OLT is an effective method of treatment for portal hypertension .
Conclusion	In addition to dramatically decreasing the splenic V , it can also decrease the splenic SNR , CNR and ADC values in patients with portal hypertension .
Conclusion	The changes of splenic SNR , CNR and ADC after OLT may be helpful in providing noninvasive supplementary information in assessing the therapeutic effect of OLT on portal hypertension .

Background	Low-fluence Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet @,@-nm laser ( LFQS ) and glycolic acid ( GA ) peeling have been reported as a treatment option for melasma .
Background	However , there are limited data on their efficacy in men .
Problem	To compare the efficacy and safety of LFQS monotherapy with combined LFQS and @ % GA peeling in male patients with melasma .
Method	Fifteen males with mixed type melasma were randomized to receive @ weekly sessions of LFQS on one side of the face and LFQS plus @ % GA peeling on the contralateral side and were followed for @ weeks .
Method	Twelve patients completed the protocol .
Result	Mean relative lightness index ( RL * I ) of the combined treatment side was lowered throughout the study period , with the maximal improvement of @ % reduction at the fourth week follow-up ( p = @ ) .
Result	Patient self-assessment was favorable in the combined treatment .
Result	However , the mean RL * I increased at @ and @ weeks of follow-up .
Result	One subject ( @ % ) developed guttate hypopigmentation , which did not resolve by the @-week follow-up .
Conclusion	Low-fluence Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet @,@-nm laser combined with GA peeling temporarily reduced melasma in men , but the incidence of side effects does not justify the short-lived benefits of this procedure .
Conclusion	This technique requires further study .

Background	Red ginseng is prepared by steaming raw ginseng , a process believed to increase the pharmacological efficacy .
Background	Further bioconversion of red ginseng through fermentation is known to increase its intestinal absorption and bioactivity , and bioconversion diminishes the toxicity of red ginseng 's metabolite .
Background	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily supplementation with fermented red ginseng ( FRG ) on glycemic status in subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type @ diabetes .
Method	This study was a four-week long , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial .
Method	Forty-two subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type @ diabetes were randomly allocated to two groups assigned to consume either the placebo or fermented red ginseng ( FRG ) three times per day for four weeks .
Method	Fasting and postprandial glucose profiles during meal tolerance tests were assessed before and after the intervention .
Result	FRG supplementation led to a significant reduction in postprandial glucose levels and led to an increase in postprandial insulin levels compared to the placebo group .
Result	There was a consistently significant improvement in the glucose area under the curve ( AUC ) in the FRG group .
Result	However , fasting glucose , insulin , and lipid profiles were not different from the placebo group .
Conclusion	Daily supplementation with FRG lowered postprandial glucose levels in subjects with impaired fasting glucose or type @ diabetes .

Problem	To examine if a small token monetary incentive ( NZ$ @ ) increases mail survey response rates and participant retention of @-@ year old New Zealand women .
Method	In @ , @ women were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral rolls for a prospective study investigating factors related to the prevention of weight gain .
Method	At baseline , @ women were randomly assigned to receive NZ$ @ with the initial survey mail-out in addition to nonmonetary gifts to encourage participation ( pen , tea bag , entry in lottery draw ) received by all women .
Method	At @ years , @ women ( @ received NZ$ @ at baseline and @ had not ) were randomly assigned to receive the same token monetary incentive .
Method	At @ years , all women identifying as an ethnic minority ( n = @ ) and @ randomly selected women of other ethnicities received the token monetary incentive with the initial mail out .
Result	The baseline response rate for women who received NZ$ @ was significantly higher than for women who did not ( @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) .
Result	At @ years , retention rate for all women who received NZ$ @ was significantly higher than for women who did not ( @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) .
Result	At @ years , among those women not identifying as an ethnic minority , the retention rate for those who received NZ$ @ was significantly higher than for those who did not ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Inclusion of a small token monetary incentive significantly increases mail survey response rates and participant retention in mid-age New Zealand women .

Problem	To compare intraocular lens implantation using a motorized injector vs standard manual injector through a @-mm clear corneal incision .
Method	Patients underwent standard phacoemulsification using a @-mm clear corneal incision .
Method	Hydrophobic acrylic aspheric intraocular lens ( Acrysof SN@WF intraocular lens ( IOL ) ) was inserted using D cartridge with manual monarch injector or autosert motorized injector .
Method	IOL safety , final incision size and wound integrity in terms of anterior and posterior wound gape , and descemet 's membrane detachment were compared between the two groups at post-operative day @ and at @ month using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography .
Result	The study recruited @ patients in the group I ( manual injector ) and @ patients in group II ( motorized injector ) .
Result	In group I , the final incision after IOL insertion increased by @ mm ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ( P < @ ) , which was seen in @ % of the patients .
Result	In group II , the incision enlarged by @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ( P = @ ) and was seen in only @ % of the cases .
Result	IOL nicks were seen in @ % of the cases in group I only .
Result	Although the incidence of descemet 's membrane detachment and anterior wound gape was similar for both groups , posterior wound gape was seen more often with the manual injector in the immediate post-operative period .
Result	( P = @ ) CONCLUSION : The motorized insertion system was gentle and safe for the IOLs with lesser incidence of IOL nicks .
Result	Regarding wound safety , it caused significantly less incision enlargement and better posterior wound integrity .

Problem	Evidence suggests a positive association between administration of psychoactive drugs and rates of cigarette smoking .
Problem	Prevalence of smoking among opioid-dependent individuals , for example , is four times greater than the general population .
Problem	We recently completed a randomized double-blind trial evaluating outpatient buprenorphine taper for prescription opioid ( PO ) abusers , which provided a unique opportunity to examine naturalistic changes in smoking among participants who detoxified without resumption of illicit opioid use .
Method	Participants received no smoking-cessation services and were not encouraged to alter their smoking in any way .
Method	A subset of @ opioid-dependent smokers , who were randomized to receive the same @-week buprenorphine taper and successfully completed detoxification , were included in the present study .
Method	They provided staff-observed urine specimens thrice-weekly throughout the @-week trial .
Method	Specimens were analyzed on-site via enzyme-multiplied immunoassay for urinary cotinine , a metabolite of nicotine that provides a sensitive biochemical measure of smoking status .
Result	Mean cotinine levels were significantly different across study phases , with significantly lower cotinine levels during taper ( @ ng/ml ) and post-taper ( @ ng/ml ) vs. intake ( @ ng/ml ) phases ( p '' s < @ ) .
Result	Overall , mean cotinine levels decreased by @ % between intake and end-of-study , reflecting a reduction of approximately eight cigarettes per day .
Conclusion	These data provide additional evidence that opioids influence smoking and extend prior findings to include primary PO abusers , rigorous double-blind opioid dosing conditions and urinary cotinine .
Conclusion	These results also suggest that , while likely insufficient for complete cessation , patients who successfully taper from opioids may also experience concurrent reductions in smoking and thus may be ideal candidates for smoking cessation services .

Background	The current study was conducted to find out whether two oral preparations of @ mg gabapentin ( the test and reference capsules ) were bioequivalent .
Method	This was a randomized , single-blind , crossover study under fasting condition , with a @-day washout period , which included @ healthy adult male and female subjects .
Method	After an overnight fast , subjects were given , orally , one capsule of the test drug or of the reference drug .
Method	Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug , then at @ and @ minutes , and @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ hours after dosing , to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of the single dose administration , ie , the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) from time zero to @ hours ( AUCt ) , AUC from time zero to infinity ( AUC ( inf ) ) , the peak plasma concentration of the drug ( Cmax ) , time needed to achieve Cmax ( tmax ) , and the elimination half-life ( t@/@ ) .
Method	The plasma concentrations of gabapentin were determined using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection .
Result	The geometric mean ratios ( @ % confidence interval ) of the test drug/reference drug for gabapentin were @ % ( @ % -@ % ) for AUCt , @ % ( @ % -@ % ) for AUC ( inf ) , and @ % ( @ % -@ % ) for Cmax .
Result	The differences in tmax and t@/@ values between the test and reference drug products for gabapentin were not statistically significant .
Result	Light-headedness , nausea , and headache were encountered during the study , but they were all mild and well tolerated .
Result	The @ % confidence intervals of the test/reference AUC ratio and Cmax ratio of gabapentin were within the acceptance range for bioequivalence .
Conclusion	The two preparations of gabapentin @ mg capsule were bioequivalent , thus both can be used interchangeably in the clinical setting .

Problem	Esophageal variceal bleed is a major problem in patients with cirrhosis .
Problem	Endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) has been shown to be equal to or better than propranolol in preventing first bleed .
Problem	Carvedilol is a non-selective blocker with alpha-@ adrenergic blocker activity .
Problem	Hemodynamic studies have shown carvedilol to be more effective than propranolol at reducing portal pressure .
Problem	We compared efficacy of carvedilol with EVL for primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleed .
Method	Cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices were randomized to carvedilol @ mg daily or EVL at three university hospitals of Pakistan .
Method	End points were esophageal variceal bleeding , death or liver transplant .
Result	Two hundred and nine patients were evaluated .
Result	Eighty two and eighty six patients were randomized in carvedilol and EVL arms respectively .
Result	Mean age was @ @ years ; @ ( @ % ) were males ; @ % had viral cirrhosis ; mean Child-Pugh score was @ @ and mean follow up was @ @ months ( range @-@ months ) .
Result	Both EVL and carvedilol groups had comparable variceal bleeding rates ( @ % vs. @ % ) , bleed related mortality ( @ % vs. @ % ) and overall mortality ( @ % vs. @ % ) respectively .
Result	Adverse events in carvedilol group were hypotension ( n = @ ) , requiring cessation of therapy , while transient nausea ( n = @ ) and dyspnea ( n = @ ) resolved spontaneously .
Result	In the EVL arm , post banding ulcer bleed ( n = @ ) and chest pain ( n = @ ) , were termed as serious adverse events while transient dysphagia ( n = @ ) resolved without treatment .
Conclusion	Although our study is underpowered , the findings suggest that carvedilol is probably not superior to EVL in preventing first variceal bleed in patients with viral cirrhosis .

Problem	The objectives of this randomized , single-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot trial were to investigate the effects of varenicline on opioid withdrawal among chronic pain patients undergoing opioid detoxification in an interdisciplinary pain program and the feasibility of varenicline use in this population .
Method	Twenty-one patients were recruited ( varenicline = @ , placebo = @ ) , and @ patients in the varenicline and @ in the placebo group completed the study .
Method	Opioid withdrawal was quantified using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale , and varenicline-related adverse effects were assessed .
Result	Opioid withdrawal scores tended to decrease over the course of opioid tapering in those receiving varenicline and increase in those receiving placebo .
Result	Varenicline was well-tolerated in this population , with no adverse drug effects ( including nausea ) observed and no effect on improvements in pain severity and depression .
Conclusion	This randomized pilot study provides preliminary data for future trials of varenicline in opioid-dependent adults with chronic pain undergoing medically directed opioid detoxification .

Background	Few treatments have the potential to reduce the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients .
Background	Some small studies have suggested that organic honey may be a useful preventive treatment .
Method	This investigator-initiated double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial investigated whether honey reduced the severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis ( ROM ) .
Method	One hundred six head and neck cancer patients from the Vancouver and Sudbury Cancer Centers in Canada were randomized to swish , hold , and swallow either @ ml of irradiated organic manuka honey or a placebo gel , four times a day throughout radiation treatment , plus seven more days .
Method	Severity of oral mucositis according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale scales , weight , and subjects ' symptom severity and quality of life were assessed weekly .
Method	Sialometry was performed at baseline and at the last study visit .
Result	One hundred six patients were recruited .
Result	Twenty-four did not attend any mucositis assessments .
Result	One was removed from the study because of off-study consumption of store-bought manuka honey .
Result	The remaining @ patients had at least one mucositis assessment and were included in the analysis .
Result	Sixty-two percent of subjects received concurrent chemotherapy ; @ % were male .
Result	The groups were well-matched , and blinding was excellent .
Result	Dropouts were mostly due to nausea and were similar in both arms , with @ % being able to tolerate the study products for more than @ week .
Result	The dropout rate was @ % in those who received honey and @ % in those who received placebo gel .
Result	The dropout rate in those who had concurrent chemotherapy was @ % and in those who only received radiation was @ % .
Result	There was no statistically significant difference between the honey and placebo arms in any of the outcome indicators .
Result	Those who completed the study in both treatment arms had low rates of RTOG greater than or equal to grade @ mucositis ; @ % in the honey group and @ % in the placebo group .
Conclusion	Despite promising earlier reports , manuka honey was not tolerated well by our patients and , even when used as directed , did not have a significant impact on the severity of ROM .

Background	Uremic pruritus as a symptom that affects hemodialysis ( HD ) patients can decrease the quality of life and increase morbidity in these patients .
Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of turmeric on uremic pruritus in HD patients .
Method	This was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted on @ HD patients suffering from pruritus .
Method	Patients ( mean age @ @ years ) were randomized into two groups : turmeric and placebo .
Method	The pruritus score and biochemical determinants including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) were compared before and at the end of the study between the two groups .
Result	The mean decrease in hs-CRP was significantly higher in the turmeric than the placebo group ( -@ @ vs. @ @ mg/l , p = @ ) .
Result	Also reduction of pruritus scores was greater in the turmeric than the placebo group ( @ @ vs. @ @ , p = @ ) .
Result	No side effect was observed during the study due to the use of turmeric .
Conclusion	This study demonstrates the possible efficacy of turmeric in decreasing hs-CRP and uremic pruritus in end stage renal disease patients .
Conclusion	Future studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of turmeric .

Background	Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is an inflammatory skin disease arising as a result of immune system and skin barrier defects .
Background	Topical corticosteroids are safe and effective treatments for AD , when used in short courses .
Background	Prolonged use is associated with skin barrier damage .
Background	Topical calcineurin inhibitors are alternative immune-modulating treatments for AD purported to have no negative effects on the skin barrier .
Problem	To compare the effects of betamethasone valerate @ % cream ( BMVc ) and tacrolimus @ % ointment ( TACo ) on the skin barrier .
Method	Twenty volunteers with quiescent AD ( no active signs for @months ) participated in a randomized observer-blind study , wherein BMVc was applied to one forearm and TACo to the other , twice daily for @weeks .
Method	The biophysical/biological properties of the stratum corneum were assessed before and after treatment .
Method	Nine volunteers with active disease and @ with healthy skin were assessed at untreated sites .
Result	BMVc significantly reduced skin barrier function , integrity and cohesion , and the levels of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ( PCA ) and urocanic acid ( UCA ) towards the subclinical barrier defect observed in patients with AD ( nonlesional sites ) .
Result	TACo preserved skin barrier function , integrity , cohesion and PCA and UCA levels , while significantly increasing skin hydration to levels comparable with healthy skin .
Result	Both treatments reduced skin surface pH and trypsin-like protease activity , with TACo doing so to a significantly greater degree .
Conclusion	In quiescent AD , @weeks of BMVc treatment adversely affected the biophysical properties of the skin and reduced the levels of natural moisturizing factor , whereas TACo improved the condition of the skin barrier .

Problem	We evaluated whether presenting prescription drug efficacy information in direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) advertising helps individuals accurately report a drug 's benefits and , if so , which numerical format is most helpful .
Method	We conducted a randomized , controlled study of individuals diagnosed with high cholesterol ( n = @ ) who viewed fictitious prescription drug print or television ads containing either no drug efficacy information or efficacy information in one of five numerical formats .
Method	We measured drug efficacy recall , drug perceptions and attitudes , behavioral intentions , and drug risk recall .
Result	Individuals who viewed absolute frequency and/or percentage information more accurately reported drug efficacy than participants who viewed no efficacy information .
Result	Participants who viewed relative frequency information generally reported drug efficacy less accurately than participants who viewed other numerical formats .
Conclusion	Adding efficacy information to DTC ads-both in print and on television-may potentially increase an individual 's knowledge of a drug 's efficacy , which may improve patient-provider communication and promote more informed decisions .
Conclusion	Providing quantitative efficacy information in a combination of formats ( e.g. , absolute frequency and percent ) may help patients remember information and make decisions about prescription drugs .

Result	Total inflammatory score was significantly high in the cyanoacrylate group at @ week , @ weeks , and @ months .
Conclusion	Both fibrin and cyanoacrylate glue are equally efficacious for muscle reattachment ; however , fibrin glue is more biotolerant compared to cyanoacrylate glue and results in less postoperative inflammation , and is thus recommended for recession in strabismus surgery .

Problem	To determine the response , toxicities , and progression free survival of a regimen of temsirolimus with or without hormonal therapy in the treatment of advanced , or recurrent endometrial carcinoma .
Background	Preclinical evidence suggested that blockade of the PI@K/AKT/mTOR pathway might overcome resistance to hormonal therapy .
Method	We performed a randomized phase II trial of intravenous temsirolimus @mg weekly versus the combination of weekly temsirolimus with a regimen of megestrol acetate @ mg bid for three weeks alternating with tamoxifen @mg bid for three weeks in women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma .
Result	There were @ eligible patients who received at least one dose of therapy with @ of these treated on the combination arm which was closed early because of an excess of venous thrombosis , with @ episodes of deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) and @ pulmonary emboli .
Result	There were three responses observed in that arm ( @ % ) .
Result	A total of @ eligible patients were treated on the single agent arm with @ episodes of DVT and @ responses ( @ % ) .
Result	Response rates were similar in patients with prior chemotherapy ( @ of @ ; @ % ) and those with no prior chemotherapy ( @ of @ ; @ % ) .
Result	Two of four patients with clear cell carcinoma responded .
Conclusion	Adding the combination of megestrol acetate and tamoxifen to temsirolimus therapy did not enhance activity and the combination was associated with an excess of venous thrombosis .
Conclusion	Temsirolimus activity was preserved in patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy .

Problem	To assess the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of continuous and discontinuous regimens of bevacizumab ( Avastin ) and ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) from a UK National Health Service ( NHS ) perspective .
Method	A within-trial cost-utility analysis with a @-year time horizon , based on a multicentre factorial , non-inferiority randomised controlled trial .
Method	@ hospital ophthalmology clinics .
Method	@ patients aged @years with untreated nAMD in the study eye .
Method	@ mg ranibizumab or @ mg bevacizumab given continuously ( monthly ) or discontinuously ( as-needed ) for @years .
Method	Quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) .
Result	Total @-year costs ranged from @/patient ( $ @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) for discontinuous bevacizumab to @/patient ( $ @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) for continuous ranibizumab .
Result	Ranibizumab was significantly more costly than bevacizumab for both continuous ( +@ / patient ( $ @ ) ; @ % CI @ to @ ; p < @ ) and discontinuous treatment ( +@ ( $ @ ) ; @ % CI @ to @ ; p < @ ) , with negligible difference in QALYs .
Result	Continuous ranibizumab would only be cost-effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if the NHS were willing to pay @ million ( $ @ million ) per additional QALY gained .
Result	Patients receiving continuous bevacizumab accrued higher total costs ( +@ ( $ @ ) ; @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) than those receiving discontinuous bevacizumab , but also accrued non-significantly more QALYs ( +@ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	Continuous bevacizumab therefore cost @ ( $ @ ) per QALY gained versus discontinuous bevacizumab .
Result	However , bootstrapping demonstrated that if the NHS is willing to pay @/QALY gained , there is a @ % chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective versus discontinuous bevacizumab .
Conclusion	Ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab , being substantially more costly and producing little or no QALY gain .
Conclusion	Discontinuous bevacizumab is likely to be the most cost-effective of the four treatment strategies evaluated in this UK trial , although there is a @ % chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective .

Background	Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ( FF/VI ) is an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta@-agonist ( ICS/LABA ) , recently approved as once-daily maintenance therapy for COPD .
Background	We compared the lung function effects of FF/VI with those of twice-daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( FP/SAL ) .
Method	Three @ week studies comparing FF/VI and FP/SAL were conducted .
Method	Patients aged @ years with moderate-to-very severe COPD were randomized to receive double-blind , double-dummy FF/VI @/@ mcg once-daily , or FP/SAL @/@ mcg twice-daily for @ weeks following a @ week placebo run-in period .
Method	The primary endpoint of each study was change from baseline trough in @-@ h weighted mean FEV ( @ ) ( wmFEV ( @ ) ) on Day @ .
Method	Safety was also assessed .
Result	In Study @ ( HZC@ ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = @ ; FP/SAL = @ ) , the increase from baseline in @-@ h wmFEV ( @ ) was significantly greater with FF/VI than FP/SAL ( @ mL , P < @ ) .
Result	In Study @ ( HZC@ ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = @ ; FP/SAL = @ ) and Study @ ( RLV@ ) ( intent-to-treat n : FF/VI = @ ; FP/SAL = @ ) , the increase from baseline in @-@ h wmFEV ( @ ) was not significantly greater with FF/VI than FP/SAL ( @ mL , P = @ ; @ mL , P = @ ) .
Result	The treatment difference was statistically but not clinically significant in a pooled analysis ( @ mL , P < @ ) .
Result	Pooled adverse events ( FF/VI @ % ; FP/SAL @ % ) and serious adverse events ( FF/VI @ % ; FP/SAL @ % ) were similar between treatments .
Conclusion	Our data suggest that once-daily FF/VI @/@ mcg provides FEV ( @ ) improvement in COPD that is at least comparable with that conferred by twice-daily FP/SAL @/@ mcg , although interpretation is limited by differences in individual study outcomes .
Conclusion	The safety profiles of FF/VI @/@ mcg and FP/SAL @/@ mcg are similar .

Problem	To investigate risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection in the Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study .
Method	Cohort of a randomized , double-masked , multicenter clinical trial .
Method	Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with at least @months of follow-up were included .
Method	Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of more than @mm Hg , visual field mean deviation worse than-@ dB , or contraindications to study medications .
Method	Patients were randomized to topical treatment with timolol @ % or brimonidine @ % .
Method	Stereophotographs were reviewed independently by @ masked graders searching for disc hemorrhages .
Method	The main outcomes investigated were the detection of disc hemorrhage at any time during follow-up and their recurrence .
Method	Ocular and systemic risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model and were tested further for independence in a multivariate model .
Result	Two hundred fifty-three eyes of @ subjects ( mean age , @ @ years ; women , @ % ; European ancestry , @ % ) followed up for an average standard deviation of @ @months were included .
Result	In the multivariate analysis , history of migraine ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ ; P = @ ) , narrower neuroretinal rim width at baseline ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) , use of systemic - blockers ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) , low mean systolic blood pressure ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) , and low mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure during follow-up ( HR , @ ; P = @ ) were significant and independent risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection .
Result	Treatment randomization was not associated with either the occurrence or recurrence of disc hemorrhages .
Conclusion	In this cohort of Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients , migraine , baseline narrower neuroretinal rim width , low systolic blood pressure and mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure , and use of systemic - blockers were risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection .
Conclusion	Randomization assignment did not influence the frequency of disc hemorrhage detection .

Background	Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) is simple and quick and has low complication rates .
Background	However , the disadvantage of local recurrence or remnant rate limits the use of this technique .
Background	We aimed to analyse the outcomes of conventional EMR and EMR with circumferential incision ( CIEMR ) , a simplified modification of EMR , in the endoscopic treatment of rectal carcinoid tumours .
Method	A total of @ consecutive patients with rectal carcinoid tumours without regional lymph node enlargement confirmed by endoscopic ultrasonography were included in the study .
Method	These patients underwent endoscopic treatment from January @ to September @ and were randomly designated into CIEMR ( n = @ ) or EMR group ( n = @ ) .
Method	En bloc resection rate , pathological complete resection rate , procedure time , complications and follow-up outcomes were analysed .
Result	The en bloc resection rate was not significantly different between the CIEMR and EMR groups ( @ % versus @ % , P > @ ) .
Result	The pathological complete resection rate was higher in the CIEMR group than in the EMR group ( @ % versus @ % , P < @ ) .
Result	The overall complication rate , delayed bleeding and procedure time were not significantly different between the two groups .
Result	No recurrence was observed in either the EMR or CIEMR group .
Conclusion	CIEMR optimises the procedure of EMR and simplifies the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection ; thus , it has a better histologically complete resection rate and more acceptable complication rate than EMR .
Conclusion	Thus , CIEMR may be preferable to conventional EMR for resection of rectal carcinoid tumours less than @ mm .

Background	There are no randomized studies that compare outcomes after single-incision ( SLC ) and conventional multi-incision ( MLC ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy under an optimized perioperative analgesic regimen .

Background	Inhaled corticosteroids , known to be effective as a maintenance medication in chronic asthma , have also been suggested as a therapy for acute asthma when given at high doses .
Method	A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children aged @ to @ years with moderate or severe acute asthma , as determined based on a clinical score of @ to @ points , where @ is the most severe .
Method	We compared the addition of budesonide @,@ g vs placebo to standard acute asthma treatment , which included salbutamol , ipratropium bromide , and a single dose of prednisolone @ mg/kg given at the beginning of therapy .
Method	The primary outcome was hospital admission rate within @ h.
Result	A total of @ ED visits by children with moderate or severe acute asthma were evaluated .
Result	Seventy-five cases out of @ ( @ % ) in the budesonide group vs @ of @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group were admitted ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	However , among cases with high baseline clinical score ( @ ) , significantly fewer children were admitted in the budesonide group ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) than in the placebo group ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The addition of budesonide nebulization did not decrease the admission rate of children with acute asthma overall .
Conclusion	However , it may decrease the admission rate of children with severe acute asthma .

Problem	To observe the therapeutic effect of cervical paravertebral block plus acupuncture treatment for cervicogenic headache .
Method	Sixty cases of cervicogenic headache were randomly and equally divided into cervical paravertebral block ( control ) group and acupuncture plus cervical paravertebral block ( acupuncture ) group .
Method	Paravertebral block was performed by injection of @ mL of @ % lidocaine solution containing triamcinolone ( @ mg ) into the @nd cervical paravertebral tissue from the cross point between the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle and the angle of jaw , once every week for three weeks .
Method	Manual acupuncture stimulation was applied to Baihui ( GV @ ) , unilateral Fengchi ( GB @ ) and Jiaosun ( SJ @ ) , once daily for @ weeks .
Method	The patients ' headache severity was assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and their cervical vertebral activity assessed by range of motion ( ROM ) before and after the treatment .
Result	Compared with pre-treatment in the same one group , the scores of both VAS and ROM at time points of one , two and three weeks after the treatment were significantly decreased in the control and acupuncture groups ( P < @ ) , suggesting a marked improvement of both headache and cervical motion after the treatment .
Result	Comparison between the two groups showed that the VAS and ROM scores of the acupuncture group were evidently lower than those of the control group at each time point after the treatment ( P < @ ) , displaying a better therapeutic effect of acupuncture plus paravertebral block for cervicogenic headache .
Conclusion	Acupuncture combined with cervical paravertebral block is effective in relieving cervicogenic headache and improving cervical vertebral activity in cervicogenic headache patients , and can strengthen the therapeutic effect of simple paravertebral block .

Background	We sought to determine the incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes in treated elderly hypertensive patients and the prognostic impact of diabetes on long-term survival .
Method	The Second Australian National Blood Pressure ( ANBP@ ) study randomized @,@ hypertensive patients aged @-@ years to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) or thiazide diuretic-based therapy and followed them for a median of @ years .
Method	Long-term survival was determined in @,@ patients over an additional median of @ years after ANBP@ ( post-trial ) .
Result	After ANBP@ , the cohort was classified into preexisting ( @ % ) , newly diagnosed ( @ % ) , and no diabetes ( @ % ) groups .
Result	A @ % higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes was observed in patients randomized to thiazide diuretic compared with ACEI-based treatment .
Result	The other predictors of newly diagnosed diabetes were having a higher body mass index , having a higher random blood glucose , and living in a regional location compared to major cities ( a geographical classification based on accessibility ) at study entry .
Result	After completion of ANBP@ , compared with those with no diabetes , the preexisting diabetes group experienced higher cardiovascular ( hazards ratio ( HR ) = @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @-@ @ ) and all-cause mortality ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) when adjusted for age , sex , and treatment .
Result	A similar pattern was observed after including the post-trial period for cardiovascular ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) and all-cause mortality ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
Result	However , when the newly diagnosed group was compared with the no diabetes group , no significant difference was observed in cardiovascular ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) or all-cause mortality ( HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) either during the ANBP@ trial or including post-trial follow-up ( cardiovascular : HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ; all-cause mortality : HR = @ ; @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	Long-term presence of diabetes reduces survival .
Conclusion	Compared with thiazide diuretics , ACEI-based antihypertensives may delay the development of diabetes in those at risk and thus potentially improve cardiovascular outcome in the elderly .

Background	Impulsive decision making is a hallmark of frequently occurring addiction disorders including alcohol dependence ( AD ) .
Background	Therefore , ameliorating impulsive decision making is a promising target for the treatment of AD .
Background	Previous studies have shown that modafinil enhances cognitive control functions in various psychiatric disorders .
Background	However , the effects of modafinil on delay discounting and its underlying neural correlates have not been investigated as yet .
Background	The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on neural correlates of impulsive decision making in abstinent AD patients and healthy control ( HC ) subjects .
Method	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects cross-over study using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) was conducted in @ AD patients and @ HC subjects .
Method	All subjects participated in two fMRI sessions in which they either received a single dose of placebo or @mg of modafinil @h before the session .
Method	During fMRI , subjects completed a delay-discounting task to measure impulsive decision making .
Result	Modafinil improved impulsive decision making in AD pateints , which was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of frontoparietal regions and reduced activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex .
Result	Moreover , modafinil-induced enhancement of functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and ventral striatum was specifically associated with improvement in impulsive decision making .
Conclusion	These findings indicate that modafinil can improve impulsive decision making in AD patients through an enhanced coupling of prefrontal control regions and brain regions coding the subjective value of rewards .
Conclusion	Therefore , the current study supports the implementation of modafinil in future clinical trials for AD .

Problem	In the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure ( EMPHASIS-HF ) , aldosterone blockade with eplerenone decreased mortality and hospitalisation in patients with mild symptoms ( New York Heart Association class II ) and chronic systolic heart failure ( HF ) .
Problem	The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in the treatment of these patients in the UK and Spain .
Result	Results from the EMPHASIS-HF trial were used to develop a discrete-event simulation model estimating lifetime direct costs and effects ( life years and quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained ) of the addition of eplerenone to standard care among patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms .
Result	Eplerenone plus standard care compared with standard care alone increased lifetime direct costs per patient by @ for the UK and @ for Spain , with additional quality-adjusted life expectancy of @ QALYs for the UK and @ QALYs for Spain .
Result	Mean lifetime costs were @ per QALY in the UK and @ per QALY in Spain .
Result	Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a @ % likelihood of eplerenone being regarded as cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of @ per QALY ( UK ) or @ per QALY ( Spain ) .
Conclusion	By currently accepted standards of value for money , the addition of eplerenone to optimal medical therapy for patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms is likely to be cost-effective .

Background	This study aimed to evaluate whether incidental CT findings of emphysema , airway thickening and bronchiectasis , as seen on CT scans performed for other non-pulmonary clinical indications , are associated with future acute exacerbations of COPD resulting in hospitalisation or death .
Method	This multicentre prospective case-cohort study comprised @ subjects who underwent routine diagnostic chest CT for non-pulmonary indications .
Method	Using a case-cohort approach , we visually graded CT scans from cases and a random sample of @ % of the baseline cohort ( n = @ ) for emphysema severity ( range @-@ ) , airway thickening ( range @-@ ) and bronchiectasis ( range @-@ ) .
Method	We used weighted Cox proportional hazards analysis to assess the independent association between CT findings and hospitalisation or death due to COPD exacerbation .
Result	During a median follow-up of @ years ( maximum @ years ) , @ COPD events were identified .
Result	The risk of experiencing a future acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in hospitalisation or death was significantly increased in subjects with severe emphysema ( score @ ) and severe airway thickening ( score @ ) .
Result	The respective HRs were @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) and @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) .
Result	Severe bronchiectasis ( score @ ) was not significantly associated with increased risk of adverse events ( HR @ ; @ % CI @ to @ ) .
Conclusion	Morphological correlates of COPD such as emphysema and airway thickening detected on CT scans obtained for other non-pulmonary indications are strong independent predictors of subsequent development of acute exacerbations of COPD resulting in hospitalisation or death .

Background	Attrition is common in alcohol clinical trials and the resultant loss of data represents an important methodological problem .
Background	In the absence of a simulation study , the drinking outcomes among those who are lost to follow-up are not known .
Background	Individuals who drop out of treatment and continue to provide drinking data , however , may be a reasonable proxy group for making inferences about the drinking outcomes of those lost to follow-up .
Method	We used data from the COMBINE study , a multisite , randomized clinical trial , to examine drinking during the @months of treatment among individuals who dropped out of treatment but continued to provide drinking data ( i.e. , `` treatment dropouts ; '' n = @ ) .
Method	First , we estimated the observed treatment effect size for naltrexone versus placebo in a sample that included both treatment completers ( n = @ ) and treatment dropouts ( n = @ ; total N = @,@ ) , as well as the observed treatment effect size among just those who dropped out of treatment ( n = @ ) .
Method	In both the total sample ( N = @,@ ) and the dropout sample ( n = @ ) , we then deleted the drinking data after treatment dropout from those @ individuals to simulate missing data .
Method	Using the deleted data sets , we then estimated the effect of naltrexone on the continuous outcome percent heavy drinking days using @ methods to handle missing data ( last observation carried forward , baseline observation carried forward , placebo mean imputation , missing = heavy drinking days , multiple imputation ( MI ) , and full information maximum likelihood -LSB- FIML -RSB- ) .
Result	MI and FIML produced effect size estimates that were most similar to the true effects observed in the full data set in all analyses , while missing = heavy drinking days performed the worst .
Conclusion	Although missing drinking data should be avoided whenever possible , MI and FIML yield the best estimates of the treatment effect for a continuous outcome measure of heavy drinking when there is dropout in an alcohol clinical trial .

Background	There is a need to identify innovative , low-cost and broad-reaching strategies for promoting exercise and improving physical function in older adults with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Method	This randomised controlled pilot trial will test the efficacy of a @-month , DVD-delivered exercise intervention to improve functional performance and quality of life in older adults with MS. Participants will be randomised either into a DVD-delivered exercise condition or an attentional control condition .
Method	This novel approach to programme delivery provides participants with detailed exercise instructions which are presented in a progressive manner and includes a variety of modifications to better meet varying levels of physical abilities .
Method	The targeted exercises focus on three critical elements of functional fitness : flexibility , strength and balance .
Method	It is hypothesised that participants who are randomised to the exercise DVD condition will demonstrate improvements in physical function compared with participants assigned to the attentional control condition .
Method	Data analysis will include a @ ( condition ) @ ( time ) mixed factor analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) that follows intent-to-treat principles , as well as an examination of effect sizes .
Method	Participants will take part in qualitative interviews about perspectives on physical activity and programme participation .

Result	There was no significant difference in rates of complications between direct laryngoscopy and Glidescope video laryngoscopy : esophageal intubations ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , aspiration events ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , desaturation ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , and hypotension ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Glidescope video laryngoscopy improves the first-attempt success rate during urgent endotracheal intubation performed by pulmonary and critical care medicine fellows when compared with direct laryngoscopy .

Background	A variety of techniques exist for the treatment of patients with great saphenous vein ( GSV ) varicosities .
Background	Few data exist on the long-term outcomes of these interventions .
Method	Patients undergoing conventional surgery , endovenous laser ablation ( EVLA ) and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy ( UGFS ) for GSV varicose veins were followed up for @ years .
Method	Primary outcome was obliteration or absence of the treated GSV segment ; secondary outcomes were absence of GSV reflux , and change in Chronic Venous Insufficiency quality-of-life Questionnaire ( CIVIQ ) and EuroQol - @D ( EQ-@D ) scores .
Result	A total of @ legs were included ( @ conventional surgery , @ EVLA , @ UGFS ) , @ ( @ per cent ) of which were evaluated at final follow-up .
Result	At @ years , Kaplan-Meier estimates of obliteration or absence of the GSV were @ ( @ per cent c.i. @ to @ ) , @ ( @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) per cent in the conventional surgery , EVLA and UGFS groups respectively .
Result	Absence of above-knee GSV reflux was found in @ ( @ to @ ) , @ ( @ to @ ) and @ ( @ to @ ) per cent respectively .
Result	CIVIQ scores deteriorated over time in patients in the UGFS group ( @ increase per year , @ per cent c.i. @ to @ ) , and were significantly worse than those in the EVLA group ( -@ decrease per year , @ per cent c.i. -@ to @ ) ( P = @ ) .
Result	CIVIQ scores for the conventional surgery group did not differ from those in the EVLA and UGFS groups ( @ increase per year , @ per cent c.i. -@ to @ ) .
Result	EQ-@D scores improved equally in all groups .
Conclusion	EVLA and conventional surgery were more effective than UGFS in obliterating the GSV @ years after intervention .
Conclusion	UGFS was associated with substantial rates of GSV reflux and inferior CIVIQ scores compared with EVLA and conventional surgery .

Background	Patients with cervical radiculopathy often have neck - and arm pain , neurological changes , activity limitations and difficulties in returning to work .
Background	Most patients are not candidates for surgery but are often treated with different conservative approaches and may be sick-listed for long periods .
Background	The purpose of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of neck-specific training versus prescribed physical activity .
Method	The current protocol is a two armed intervention randomised clinical trial comparing the outcomes of patients receiving neck specific training or prescribed physical activity .
Method	A total of @ patients with cervical radiculopathy will be randomly allocated to either of the two interventions .
Method	The interventions will be delivered by experienced physiotherapists and last @ weeks .
Method	The primary outcome variable is neck - and arm pain intensity measured with a Visual Analogue Scale accompanied with secondary outcome measures of impairments and subjective health measurements collected before intervention and at @ , @ , @ and @ months after base-line assessment .
Conclusion	We anticipate that the results of this study will provide evidence to support recommendations as to the effectiveness of conservative interventions for patients with cervical radiculopathy .

Background	To provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease , new vaccines containing conserved Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins are being developed .
Background	This study assessed the safety , reactogenicity and immunogenicity of four formulations containing pneumococcal proteins pneumolysin toxoid ( dPly ) and histidine triad protein ( PhtD ) in toddlers .
Method	In this phase II , multicenter , observer-blind study ( www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT@ ) conducted in the Czech Republic , toddlers ( @-@ months ) were randomized ( @:@:@:@:@ ) to receive one of four investigational vaccine formulations ( @ or @g each of dPly and PhtD , alone or in combination with polysaccharide conjugates from the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein-D conjugate vaccine -LSB- PHiD-CV -RSB- ) , or the licensed PHiD-CV , in a @-dose primary series plus booster at study months @ , @ and @ .
Method	Solicited local and general symptoms were recorded within seven days post-vaccination , unsolicited symptoms within @ days post-vaccination , and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) during the entire study period .
Method	Antibody concentrations against the vaccine components were measured pre-vaccination , one month post-dose @ , pre - and one month post-booster .
Result	@ toddlers were enrolled and vaccinated .
Result	Percentages of solicited local and general symptoms following the different investigational formulations were generally within the same ranges as for PHiD-CV .
Result	After each dose , grade @ fever ( > @ C , rectal measurement ) was reported for maximum one toddler in each group with no differences between investigational formulations and PHiD-CV during primary vaccination .
Result	@ SAEs were reported for @ toddlers , with distribution balanced between all groups except the group receiving @ g dPly/PhtD with PHiD-CV-conjugates ( no SAEs reported ) .
Result	None of the SAEs were considered to be vaccine-related .
Result	For all pneumococcal protein-containing formulations , anti-PhtD and anti-Ply antibody geometric mean concentrations increased from pre-vaccination to post-dose @ and from pre - to post-booster vaccination .
Conclusion	All investigational vaccine formulations were well-tolerated and immunogenic when administered to toddlers as a @-dose primary vaccination followed by a booster dose .

Background	Inhaled lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces a dose-dependent , acute neutrophilic response in the airways of healthy volunteers that can be quantified in induced sputum .
Background	Chemokines , such as CXCL@ and CXCL@ , play an important role in neutrophilic inflammation in the lung through the activation of CXCR@ and small molecule antagonists of these receptors have now been developed .
Background	We investigated the effect of AZD@ , a CXCR@ antagonist , compared with placebo on LPS-induced inflammation measured in sputum of healthy volunteers .
Method	Twenty healthy subjects were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled , cross-over study .
Method	AZD@ ( @ mg ) or placebo was dosed twice daily orally for @ days prior to challenge with inhaled LPS and induced sputum was collected @ h later .
Result	Treatment with AZD@ showed a mean @ % reduction in total sputum cells ( p < @ ) and @ % reduction in sputum neutrophils ( p < @ ) compared with placebo after LPS challenge .
Result	There was also a reduction in neutrophil elastase activity ( p < @ ) and CXCL@ ( p < @ ) and trends for reductions in sputum macrophages ( @ % ) , leukotriene B@ ( @ % ) and CXCL@ ( @ % ) .
Conclusion	AZD@ inhibited LPS-induced inflammation measured in induced sputum of normal volunteers , indicating that this treatment may be useful in the treatment of neutrophilic diseases of the airways , such as COPD , severe asthma and cystic fibrosis .

Background	The prognostic utility of circulating plasma microRNA in patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) has been proposed but not yet demonstrated .
Background	We set out to investigate circulating microRNA levels in patients incurring recent ACS and examined associations with neurohormones , cardiac structure and function , and survival over @ years of follow-up .
Method	An initial screen of @ microRNAs was performed in @ ACS patients and @ healthy controls .
Method	Candidates identified from the initial screen ( miR-@-@p , miR-@ , miR-@b , miR-@ and miR-@a ) were validated in a further cohort of @ patients at baseline ( ~ @ days post-ACS ) and at @ and @ months post-ACS , and compared with @ controls .
Result	In the validation cohort , significantly higher levels in patients were replicated for miR-@-@p , miR-@ and miR-@b ( @-fold , @-fold and @-fold , respectively , adjusted p < @ ) .
Result	Lower levels of miR-@ were not replicated and miR-@a was undetectable .
Result	From baseline to @ months post-admission , miR-@-@p and miR-@ remained elevated in patients compared to controls ( adjusted p < @ ) , with no further change in levels between @ and @ months ; whereas miR-@b fell to control levels by @ months .
Result	Baseline levels of miR-@ in the lowest tertile were significantly associated with readmission for heart failure ( log-rank p < @ ) .
Result	In combination with NT-proBNP and LVEF , miR-@ significantly improved risk stratification ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our study identifies miR-@ as a novel candidate biomarker for post-ACS prognosis beyond existing biomarkers of LVEF and NT-proBNP .
Conclusion	Moreover circulating miR-@-@p was markedly elevated in patients for at least a year post-ACS and may be a stable biomarker for ACS .

Background	Pilonidal sinus disease is associated with significant morbidity after surgical treatment with regard to wound healing .
Background	Recent case studies suggested that negative-pressure wound therapy as primary treatment following surgical excision may shorten the duration of wound healing .
Problem	The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the role of vacuum therapy in pilonidal sinus disease : negative-pressure wound therapy versus standard open wound care after surgical excision .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned to either negative-pressure wound therapy for @ weeks or standard open wound healing .
Method	The primary end point of the study was the time to complete wound healing .
Method	Secondary end points were visual analog scale score , wound size ratio at day @ ( ie , wound healing rate ) , time to resume daily activities , and recurrence within @ months after wound closure .
Result	Forty-nine patients were included in the study : @ patients were treated with vacuum therapy , and @ patients underwent standard open wound care .
Result	Complete wound healing was achieved at a median of @ days in the vacuum therapy group versus @ days in control patients ( p = @ ) .
Result	The wound size ratio was significantly lower in the vacuum therapy group ( @ versus @ , p = @ ) , ie , higher wound healing rate in the first @ weeks .
Result	There was no difference in visual analog scale scores and disease recurrence between both groups .
Result	The time to resume full daily activities after surgery was @ days in the patients undergoing vacuum therapy and @ days in the control patients ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This study is limited by the small number of patients , the lack of blinding to patients and doctors , and the absence of patient quality-of-life evaluation .
Conclusion	It is feasible to apply vacuum therapy in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease , and it has a positive effect on wound size reduction in the first @ weeks .
Conclusion	However , there is no difference in time to complete wound healing and time to resume daily life activities .

Background	Depression is not a normal side effect of aging , however it is one of the most prevalent mental health issues in later life , imposing a tremendous burden on patients , their families , and the healthcare system .
Background	We describe the experimental implementation of a collaborative , stepped-care model for the treatment of late-life depression ( GermanIMPACT trial ) in the German primary care context .
Background	GermanIMPACT was developed as an adaptation of a successful and widely used American model .
Background	The aim of the study is to evaluate the model 's applicability to the German primary care setting and its cost-effectiveness .
Method	The study will be conducted as a cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing the development of depressive symptoms in primary care patients who either receive treatment as usual ( control arm ) or treatment according to the GermanIMPACT model ( intervention arm ) .
Method	In two German cities ( Freiburg and Hamburg ) , a total of @ general practice offices will be selected and randomized .
Method	Each general practice office will be asked to enroll five patients into the trial who are @ years of age or older and who show moderate depressive symptoms in the scope of a diagnosed depressive episode , recurrent depressive disorder , or dysthymia .
Method	General practices in the control arm will provide treatment as usual ; general practices in the intervention arm will work closely with a specially trained care manager and a supervising mental health specialist .
Method	Evidence-based elements of the treatment plan manual include patient education , identification and integration of positive activities into the daily routine , relapse prevention , and training of problem-solving techniques as needed .
Method	The intervention period per patient will be one year .
Method	Data will be collected at baseline , @ , and @ months .
Method	Primary outcome is the patient-reported change of depressive symptoms ( Patient Health Questionnaire , PHQ-@ ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes include measures of quality of life , anxiety , depression-related behavior , problem-solving skills , resilience , and an overall economic evaluation of the program .
Conclusion	The GermanIMPACT trial will provide evidence about the effectiveness , feasibility , and cost-effectiveness of collaborative stepped care in treating late-life depression in German primary care .
Conclusion	Positive results will be a first step toward integrating specialized depression care managers into the primary care setting .

Background	There are limited data to inform the choice between parental presence at clinical bedside rounds ( PPCBR ) and non-PPCBR in neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ) .
Method	We performed a single-centre , survey-based , crossed-over randomised trial involving parents of all infants who were admitted to NICU and anticipated to stay > @ days .
Method	Parents were randomly assigned using a computer-generated stratified block randomisation protocol to start with PPCBR or non-PPCBR and then crossed over to the other arm after a wash-out period .
Method	At the conclusion of each arm , parents completed the ` NICU Parental Stressor Scale ' ( a validated tool ) and a satisfaction survey .
Method	After completion of the trial , we surveyed all healthcare providers who participated at least in one PPCBR rounding episode .
Method	We also offered all participating parents and healthcare providers the opportunity to partake in a focus group discussion regarding PPCBR .
Result	A total of @ parents were enrolled in this study , with @ parents ( @ % ) partially or fully completing the trial .
Result	Of the parents who completed the trial , @ % agreed that parents should be allowed to attend clinical bedside rounds .
Result	A total of @ healthcare providers ' surveys were returned and @ ( @ % ) agreed that parents should be allowed to attend rounds .
Result	Nine healthcare providers and @ parents participated in an interview or focus group , augmenting our understanding of the ways in which PPCBR was beneficial .
Conclusion	Parents and healthcare providers strongly support PPCBR .
Conclusion	NICUs should develop policies allowing PPCBR while mitigating the downsides and concerns of parents and healthcare providers such as decreased education opportunity and confidentiality concerns .

Problem	Despite a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms , cold water immersion ( CWI ) is widely used by athletes for recovery .
Problem	This study examined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity exercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute performance or psychological benefits .
Method	Thirty males ( mean SD : age , @ @ yr ; VO@ peak , @ @ mL kg ( -@ ) min ( -@ ) ) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session , comprised of @ @-s sprints , immediately followed by one of the following three @-min recovery conditions : CWI ( @ C @ C ) , thermoneutral water immersion placebo ( TWP ) ( @ C @ C ) , or thermoneutral water immersion control ( TWI ) ( @ C @ C ) .
Method	An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during exercise and recovery to record muscle temperature .
Method	Swelling ( thigh girth ) , pain threshold/tolerance , interleukin @ concentration , and total leukocyte , neutrophil , and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline , postexercise , postrecovery , and @ , @ , and @ h postexercise .
Method	A maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVC ) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points , with the exception of postexercise .
Method	Self-assessments of readiness for exercise , fatigue , vigor , sleepiness , pain , and belief of recovery effectiveness were also completed .
Result	Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise , pain , and vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP which were similar to each other .
Conclusion	A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity interval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over @ h as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI .
Conclusion	This can be attributed to improved ratings of readiness for exercise , pain , and vigor , suggesting that the commonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly placebo related .

Background	Airway inflammation , mediated in part by LTB@ , contributes to lung destruction in patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .
Background	LTB ( @ ) - receptor inhibition may reduce airway inflammation .
Background	We report the results of a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of the leukotriene B ( @ ) ( LTB ( @ ) ) - receptor antagonist BIIL @ BS in CF patients .
Method	CF patients aged @ years with mild to moderate lung disease were randomized to oral BIIL @ BS or placebo once daily for @ weeks .
Method	Co-primary endpoints were change in FEV ( @ ) and incidence of pulmonary exacerbation .
Result	After @ ( @ children , @ adults ) of the planned @ patients were randomized , the trial was terminated after a planned interim analysis revealed a significant increase in pulmonary related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) in adults receiving BIIL @ BS .
Result	Final analysis revealed SAEs in @ % of adults receiving BIIL @ BS vs. @ % receiving placebo ( p = @ ) , and in @ % of children receiving BIIL @ BS vs. @ % receiving placebo ( p = @ ) .
Result	In adults , the incidence of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation was greater in those receiving BIIL @ BS than in those receiving placebo ( @ % vs. @ % respectively ; p = @ ) .
Result	In children , the incidence of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation was @ % in the BIIL @ BS arm , and @ % in the placebo arm ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	While the cause of increased SAEs and exacerbations due to BIIL @ BS is unknown , the outcome of this trial provides a cautionary tale for the administration of potent anti-inflammatory compounds to individuals with chronic infections , as the potential to significantly suppress the inflammatory response may increase the risk of infection-related adverse events .

Background	Inadequacy in mental health care in low and middle income countries has been an important contributor to the rising global burden of disease .
Background	The treatment gap is salient in resource-poor settings , especially when providing care for conflict-affected forced migrant populations .
Background	Primary care is often the only available service option for the majority of forced migrants , and integration of mental health into primary care is a difficult task .
Background	The proposed pilot study aims to explore the feasibility of integrating mental health care into primary care by providing training to primary care practitioners serving displaced populations , in order to improve identification , treatment , and referral of patients with common mental disorders via the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Programme ( mhGAP ) .
Method	This pilot randomized controlled trial will recruit @ primary care practitioners ( PCP ) serving in the Puttalam and Mannar districts of Sri Lanka ( with displaced and returning conflict-affected populations ) .
Method	The intervention arm will receive a structured training program based on the mhGAP intervention guide .
Method	Primary outcomes will be rates of correct identification , adequate management based on set criteria , and correct referrals of common mental disorders .
Method	A qualitative study exploring the attitudes , views , and perspectives of PCP on integrating mental health and primary care will be nested within the pilot study .
Method	An economic evaluation will be carried out by gathering service utilization information .
Conclusion	In post-conflict Sri Lanka , an important need exists to provide adequate mental health care to conflict-affected internally displaced persons who are returning to their areas of origin after prolonged displacement .
Conclusion	The proposed study will act as a local demonstration project , exploring the feasibility of formulating a larger-scale intervention study in the future , and is envisaged to provide information on engaging PCP , and data on training and evaluation including economic costs , patient recruitment , and acceptance and follow-up rates .
Conclusion	The study should provide important information on the WHO mhGAP intervention guide to add to the growing evidence base of its implementation .

Background	Bardoxolone methyl , an Nrf@-activating and nuclear factor-B-inhibiting semisynthetic oleanane triterpenoid compound , was evaluated in a phase @ trial ( BEACON ) in patients with type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) and stage @ chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .
Background	The trial was terminated because of an increase in heart failure events in the bardoxolone methyl group , many of which appeared related to fluid retention .
Background	Thus , additional analyses were conducted to explain these serious adverse events .
Method	Patients ( n = @,@ ) were randomized to receive once-daily bardoxolone methyl ( @ mg ) or placebo .
Method	Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed in a subset of the BEACON population and from a separate , open-label pharmacology study in patients with stage @b/@ CKD and T@DM administered @ mg bardoxolone methyl once daily for @ consecutive days .
Result	Bardoxolone-methyl-treated patients in the BEACON substudy had a clinically meaningful reduction in urine volume and sodium excretion at week @ relative to baseline ( p < @ ) , and a separate study revealed that decreased sodium excretion and urine output occurred in some patients with stage @ CKD but not those with stage @b CKD .
Result	The clinical phenotype of fluid overload and heart failure in BEACON was similar to that observed with endothelin receptor antagonists in advanced CKD patients , and preclinical data demonstrate that bardoxolone methyl modifies endothelin signaling .
Conclusion	The totality of the evidence suggests that through modulation of the endothelin pathway , bardoxolone methyl may pharmacologically promote acute sodium and volume retention and increase blood pressure in patients with more advanced CKD .

Background	To determine the efficacy of combining of Boswellia serrata L. resin and the root of Cyperus scariosus L. plus PFMT in reproductive age women with stress urinary incontinence .
Method	A prospective , single-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial was conducted .
Method	The patients were randomized to receive orally either combination of equal quantity of B.serrata and C.scariosus ( @g ) ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) respectively twice daily for @ weeks in addition to pelvic floor muscle training in both groups .
Method	The outcome was one hour pad test .
Method	The results were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric test .
Result	The improvement in the test and control group was @ % and @ % respectively .
Result	Between the group comparison was statistically significant ( P = @ ) .
Result	The intra group comparison of one hour pad test was statistically significant in both groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	No adverse effects were noted .
Conclusion	The test group was more effective than control group in women with SUI .

Background	New antithrombotic drugs for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders in AF that are less demanding on local staff and facilities than warfarin should be welcomed if proved successful .
Problem	The comparative value and possible dangers of substituting the new drug dabigatran as a replacement remain to be established .
Problem	Its safety and effectiveness must be reviewed and assessed by further study .
Method	Clinical results of the European Action on Anticoagulation ( EAA ) computer-assisted dosage study and the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy ( RE-LY ) trial have been compared .
Result	Clinical events were lower in patients on warfarin in the EAA study compared to patients on both warfarin and dabigatran in the RE-LY study .
Conclusion	Evaluations should recognize optimum requirements for safe and effective administration of both types of drug .
Conclusion	In the warfarin arm improvements in effectiveness and safety recently introduced ( i.e. the PT/INR line and variance growth analysis ) should be included as they have been shown to be successful in improved prediction of bleeding and further thromboembolism .
Conclusion	The incidence of bleeding with dabigatran , for which there is no antidote , will require evaluation .

Background	Standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype @ ( CHC G-@ ) infection includes pegylated interferon plus ribavirin ( PEG-RBV ) for @ weeks .
Background	Shorter treatment regimen would be more acceptable due to lower cost and fewer side-effects .
Background	We aimed to compare the efficacy of @ week PEG-RBV therapy with standard @ week therapy in CHC G-@ patients who achieve complete early virological response ( cEVR ) .
Method	Consecutive treatment-nave patients with CHC G-@ were treated with pegylated interferon a@b ( @ g/kg/week ) or @a ( @ g/week ) and weight based ribavirin .
Method	Patients who achieved cEVR at @ weeks -LSB- undetectable HCV RNA irrespective of RVR ( rapid virological response ) -RSB- were randomized into - group A ( @ weeks therapy ) and group B ( @ weeks therapy ) .
Method	Primary end-point was achievement of sustained virological response ( SVR ) at @ weeks of follow up .
Result	Out of the total @ patients started on treatment , @ ( @ % ) achieved cEVR , and were randomized into group A ( n = @ ) and group B ( n = @ ) .
Result	Fifty-five ( @ % ) patients in group A and @ ( @ % ) in group B completed therapy .
Result	The overall SVR rate in group A was @ % ( @/@ ) and group B was @ % ( @/@ ) ( p = @ ) .
Result	SVR rates in the two groups were comparable in all patient sub-groups according to factors like viral load ( or > @,@ IU/mL ) , RVR ( achieved/not achieved ) , age ( or > @ years ) , body mass index ( or > @ ) and cirrhosis ( present/absent ) .
Conclusion	In CHC G-@ patients who achieve cEVR , @ weeks PEG-RBV therapy is as effective as standard @ weeks therapy , irrespective of other host or virological factors .

Method	Randomized trial with a concurrent observational cohort study .
Problem	To compare @-year outcomes of surgery with nonoperative care for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis .
Background	Surgery for spinal stenosis has been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment during @ years , but longer-term data are less clear .
Method	Surgical candidates from @ centers in @ US states with at least @ weeks of symptoms and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized cohort or observational cohort .
Method	Treatment was standard , decompressive laminectomy versus standard nonoperative care .
Method	Primary outcomes were SF-@ ( MOS @-Item Short-Form Health Survey ) Bodily Pain and Physical Function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index assessed at @ weeks , @ months , @ months , and yearly up to @ years .
Result	Data were obtained for @ % of participants in the randomized group and @ % of participants in the observational group at the @-year follow-up .
Result	Intent-to-treat analyses showed no differences between randomized cohorts ; however , @ % of those randomized to surgery and @ % of those randomized to nonoperative had undergone surgery by @ years .
Result	As-treated analyses in the randomized group showed that the early benefit for surgery out to @ years converged over time , with no significant treatment effect of surgery seen in years @ to @ for any of the primary outcomes .
Result	In contrast , the observational group showed a stable advantage for surgery in all outcomes between years @ and @ .
Result	Patients who were lost to follow-up were older , less well-educated , sicker , and had worse outcomes during the first @ years in both surgical and nonoperative arms .
Conclusion	Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis show diminishing benefits of surgery in as-treated analyses of the randomized group between @ and @ years , whereas outcomes in the observational group remained stable .
Conclusion	Loss to follow-up of patients with worse early outcomes in both treatment groups could lead to overestimates of long-term outcomes but likely not bias treatment effect estimates .

Background	Fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine ( FDC-I/H ) reduced mortality by @ % and death or first hospitalization for heart failure ( HF ) by @ % in the African-American Heart Failure Trial ( A-HeFT ) .
Background	Reduction in mortality makes it difficult to determine the effect on hospitalizations unless the analysis adjusts for death as a competing risk .
Result	In A-HeFT , @ self-identified black patients with moderate to severe HF were randomized to FDC-I/H or placebo .
Result	The effects of FDC-I/H on first and all hospitalizations and @-day readmission rates were analyzed .
Result	Deaths as competing risks were adjusted using Fine-Gray regression and joint models of hospitalizations and mortality .
Result	There were @ all-cause and @ HF hospitalizations in placebo compared with @ and @ hospitalizations in the FDC-I/H group .
Result	Adjusting for deaths as a competing risk , the effect of FDC-I/H on the first hospitalization for HF , expressed in hazard ratio ( @ % confidence interval ) , was @ ( @-@ @ ; P < @ ) and @ ( @-@ @ ; P = @ ) on the first all-cause hospitalization .
Result	The effect of FDC-I/H on all recurrent hospitalizations for HF was @ ( @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , similar to the effect on the first hospitalizations for HF , whereas the effect on all hospitalizations for any cause was @ ( @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	The @-day all-cause readmission rate after the first hospitalization for HF was @ % ( @ of @ ) in placebo versus @ % ( @ of @ ) in the FDC-I/H group , but the effect ( @ ; @-@ @ ; P = @ ) in this small subgroup was not significant .
Conclusion	Treatment with FDC-I/H was associated with a substantial reduction in the first and recurrent HF hospitalizations , and in total all-cause hospitalizations , reducing the total burden of costly and distressing hospitalizations .

Problem	To explore the efficacy and effect mechanism of the combined therapy of acupuncture and tapping method in the treatment of obesity and hyperlipidemia of liver qi stagnation and spleen deficiency pattern in the patients .
Method	One hundred and four female patients were randomized into a combined therapy of acupuncture and tapping ( combined therapy group ) group method and an acupuncture group , @ cases in each group .
Method	In the acupuncture group , acupuncture was applied to Qimen ( LR @ ) , Taichong ( LR @ ) , Zhangmen ( LR @ ) , Taibai ( SP @ ) , Zusanli ( ST @ ) , Geshu ( BL @ ) , Ganshu ( BL @ ) , Pishu ( BL @ ) , etc. .
Method	In the combined therapy group , on the basis of acupuncture treatment , the tapping method with plum blossom needle was used at each acupoint .
Method	The treatment was given once every two days , continuously for @ months in the two groups .
Method	The indices were observed , including the obesity indices , such as body mass , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat percentage ( F % ) and obesity degree ( A ) ; the blood lipid levels such as total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) ; the fat-islet axie relevant indices such as fasting plasma glucose ( FBS ) , fasting leptin ( FLP ) , fasting insulin ( FINS ) , insulin sensitive index ( ISI ) , insulin resistance in - dex ( Homa IR ) , insulin secretion index ( Homa - ) and autonomic nerve function index ( Y value ) before and after treatment in the patients of two groups .
Method	The efficacy was compared between the two groups .
Result	The total effective rates were @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) in the combined therapy group and the acupuncture group respectively , without significant difference in comparison ( P > @ ) .
Result	Obesity indices , blood lipid indices , fat-islet axie relevant indices and autonomic nerve function indices were all improved after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups ( P < @ , P < @ ) , and the improvements in the combined therapy group were much more significant ( P < @ , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The combined therapy of acupuncture and tapping method achieves the double effects of weight loss and lipid loss in the treatment of obesity combined with hyperlipidemia .
Conclusion	The effect mechanism is possibly related to the positive regulations of blood glucose , lipid metabolism and fat-islet axie in the patients .

Problem	Cisplatin plus @-fluorouracil has been globally accepted as a standard regimen for the treatment for advanced gastric cancer .
Problem	However , cisplatin has several disadvantages , including renal toxicity and the need for admission .
Problem	S-@ plus cisplatin has become a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer in East Asia .
Problem	This phase III study was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of adding docetaxel to S-@ without a platinum compound in patients with advanced gastric cancer .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel plus S-@ or S-@ alone .
Method	The docetaxel plus S-@ group received docetaxel on day @ and oral S-@ on days @-@ of a @-day cycle .
Method	The S-@ alone group received oral S-@ on days @-@ of a @-day cycle .
Method	The primary end point was overall survival .
Result	Of the @ patients enrolled , @ were eligible for analysis .
Result	The median overall survival was @ months in the docetaxel plus S-@ group and @ months in the S-@ alone group ( p = @ ) .
Result	The median progression-free survival was @ months in the docetaxel plus S-@ group and @ months in the S-@ alone group ( p = @ ) .
Result	As for adverse events , neutropenia was more frequent in the docetaxel plus S-@ group , but remained manageable .
Conclusion	As first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer , docetaxel plus S-@ significantly improves median overall and progression-free survival as compared with S-@ alone .
Conclusion	( ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT@ ) .

Background	This study examines the cost effectiveness of group follow-up after participation in the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating ( DAFNE ) structured education programme for type @ diabetes .
Method	Economic evaluation conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial involving @ adults with type @ diabetes in Ireland .
Method	Group follow-up involved two group education ` booster ' sessions post-DAFNE .
Method	Individual follow-up involved two standard one-to-one hospital clinic visits .
Method	Incremental costs , quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained and cost effectiveness were estimated at @ months .
Method	Uncertainty was explored using sensitivity analysis and by estimating cost effectiveness acceptability curves .
Result	Group follow-up was associated with a mean reduction in QALYs gained of @ per patient ( P value , @ ; @ % CI , -@ to @ , intra-class correlation ( ICC ) , @ ) and a mean reduction in total healthcare costs of @ ( P value , @ ; @ % CI , -@,@ to -@ : ICC , @ ) per patient .
Result	At alternative threshold values of @,@ , @,@ , @,@ , @,@ , and @,@ , the probability of group follow-up being cost effective was estimated to be @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ respectively .
Conclusion	The results do not support implementation of group follow-up as the sole means of follow-up post-DAFNE .
Conclusion	Given the reported cost savings , future studies should explore the cost effectiveness of alternative models of group care for diabetes .

Problem	To assess the effect of two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , fluvoxamine and citalopram , that markedly differ in their level of cytochrome P@ ( CYP ) @C@ inhibition , on the laboratory response to clopidogrel , a prodrug requiring metabolism by the CYP system , and especially CYP@C@ , to produce its active form .
Method	Randomized , double-blind , crossover trial .
Method	Clinical research unit of an academic medical center .
Method	Fifteen healthy male volunteers .
Method	All subjects received clopidogrel as a @-mg loading dose on day @ , followed by @mg/day on days @ and @ .
Method	Platelet function was tested at baseline and then after clopidogrel treatment on day @ .
Method	After a washout period of @weeks , subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive either citalopram @mg/day or fluvoxamine @mg/day for @days .
Method	On day @ , platelet function was tested while receiving the SSRI treatment alone ; then , a @-mg clopidogrel loading dose was administered , followed by clopidogrel @mg/day on days @ and @ .
Method	Platelet function was then reassessed on day @ while receiving the combination of the SSRI and clopidogrel .
Method	The treatment protocol was then repeated after a washout period of @weeks in all subjects with the other SSRI .
Result	The antiplatelet effects of fluvoxamine and citalopram and their interactions with clopidogrel were assessed .
Result	The response to these three drugs was assessed by light transmittance aggregometry and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation , reporting P@Y@ receptor reactivity .
Result	Both fluvoxamine and citalopram tended to reduce adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation : @ % at baseline , @ % while receiving citalopram , and @ % while receiving fluvoxamine .
Result	All subjects had a good laboratory response to clopidogrel , with a mean aggregation of @ % and a mean platelet reactivity index of @ % ( p < @ compared with baseline for both methods ) .
Result	Laboratory response to clopidogrel was significantly attenuated in the presence of fluvoxamine compared with the response in the presence of citalopram as tested both by aggregometry ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) and by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Fluvoxamine attenuated the laboratory response to clopidogrel , possibly through inhibition of CYP@C@ , whereas citalopram did not affect this response .
Conclusion	These potential drug interactions should be taken into consideration in the selection of the appropriate antidepressant agent for patients who are treated with clopidogrel .

Background	Optimal starting point for antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) has been uncertain .
Method	Parallel group , single blind , randomised controlled study of adult HIV positive patients consulting at the Protestant Hospital , Ngaoundere , Cameroon in @-@ .
Method	Simple randomisation of patients in WHO clinical stage @-@ to start of ART early or deferred , i.e. when CD@ counts dropped below @ versus @ cells/mm ( @ ) , or when they reached clinical stage @-@ .
Method	Clinical follow-up every three months were offered for all patients .
Method	Main outcomes were clinical stage , CD@ differences and mortality .
Method	Of @ consulting patients , most were excluded , mainly because they were already in WHO stage @-@ .
Method	Forty-four patients were randomised .
Result	In the ` early ' group two patients died and five were lost to follow-up .
Result	In the ` deferred ' group , six patients died and nine were lost to follow-up ( Hazard ratio for death by early compared to deferred treatment @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
Result	Of the patients lost to follow-up , three patients in the ` early ' group and four patients in the ` deferred ' group were known to be alive when the study ended .
Result	Fourteen patients in the early group and @ in the deferred group started ART .
Result	Twenty-two patients were evaluated clinically six to seven months after the study period was terminated .
Result	Except for one patient with AIDS , these were all still in clinical stage @-@ .
Conclusion	In our small sample , relative risk for death did not differ significantly , but deferred treatment seemed to carry no increased survival or other clinical advantage .
Conclusion	During the study period , other studies made WHO change its guidelines to conform to our early treatment .
Conclusion	The tendency in our study lends support to this policy .

Problem	To prospectively assess the antiinflammatory effect of volatile anesthetic sevoflurane in patients undergoing open lung surgery with one lung ventilation ( OLV ) .
Method	This prospective , randomized study included @ patients undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV ( NCT@ ) .
Method	The patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups that received either propofol or sevoflurane .
Method	Four patients were excluded from the study because after surgery they received blood transfusion or non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs .
Method	Inflammatory mediators ( interleukins @ , @ , and @ , C-reactive protein -LSB- CRP -RSB- , and procalcitonin ) were measured perioperatively .
Method	The infiltration of the nonoperated lung was assessed on chest x-rays and the oxygenation index was calculated .
Method	The major postoperative complications were counted .
Result	Interleukin @ levels were significantly higher in propofol than in sevoflurane group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Preoperative CRP levels did not differ between the groups ( P = @ ) and in all patients they were lower than @ mg/L , but postoperative CRP was significantly higher in propofol group ( @ vs @ ng/L ; P = @ ) ; Pre - and postoperative procalcitonin was within the reference range ( < @ g/L ) in both groups .
Result	The oxygenation index was significantly lower in propofol group ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant difference between the groups in lung infiltrates ( P = @ ) .
Result	The number of postoperative adverse events was higher in propofol group , but the difference was not-significant ( @ vs @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The study suggests an antiinflammatory effect of sevoflurane in patients undergoing thoracotomy with OLV .

Result	After @ years , we found a greater decline in arterial stiffness , relative fluid overload , and systolic BP in the bioimpedance group than the clinical-methods group .
Result	Between-group differences in change from baseline to the end of intervention were-@ @ ( @ % CI,-@ @ to @ ) m/s for pulse wave velocity ( P < @ ) , -@ % ( @ % CI,-@ @ % to-@ @ % ) for relative fluid overload ( P = @ ) , and-@ @ ( @ % CI,-@ @ to @ ) mmHg for systolic BP ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Echocardiography was not performed as cardiovascular assessment and the caregivers were not masked to the intervention .
Conclusion	Our study showed improvement in both surrogate and hard end points after strict volume control using bioimpedance to guide dry weight adjustment .
Conclusion	These findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial .

Background	Postoperative analgesia is important in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery .
Background	We prospectively compared the efficacy of ropivacaine and that of levobupivacaine for postoperative epidural analgesia in patients undergoing gynecological open abdominal surgery .
Method	Fifty-two ASA @-@ patients scheduled for gynecological open abdominal surgery under combined general and epidural anesthesia were enrolled and randomized into two groups .
Method	In ropivacaine group ( n = @ ) the patients received @ % ropivacaine and fentanyl @ microg x ml ( -@ ) for postoperative epidural analgesia .
Method	In levobupivacaine group ( n = @ ) the patients received @ % levobupivacaine and fentanyl @ microg ml ( -@ ) .
Method	Visual analogue scale ( resting pain and pain on mobilization ) , the amount of rescue analgesics and epidural anesthesia related adverse events such as hypotension , nausea and vomiting were observed for @ hours after surgery .
Result	There were no differences in visual analogue scale at all intervals between the two groups .
Result	In levobupivacaine group the patients used less amounts of rescue analgesics than ropivacaine group ( P = @ ) .
Result	There were no differences in the incidences of postoperative hypotension , nausea and vomiting between the two groups .
Conclusion	Both @ % ropivacaine and levobupivacaine similarly provide appropriate postoperative epidural analgesia for patients undergoing gynecological open abdominal surgery .

Background	Cardiac mortality and electrophysiological dysfunction both increase with age .
Background	Heart rate variability ( HRV ) provides indices of autonomic function and electrophysiology that are associated with cardiac risk .
Background	How habitual physical activity among older adults prospectively relates to HRV , including nonlinear indices of erratic sinus patterns , is not established .
Background	We hypothesized that increasing the levels of both total leisure-time activity and walking would be prospectively associated with more favorable time-domain , frequency-domain , and nonlinear HRV measures in older adults .
Result	We evaluated serial longitudinal measures of both physical activity and @-hour Holter HRV over @ years among @ older US adults in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study .
Result	After multivariable adjustment , greater total leisure-time activity , walking distance , and walking pace were each prospectively associated with specific , more favorable HRV indices , including higher @-hour standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals ( Ptrend = @ , @ , @ , respectively ) and ultralow-frequency power ( Ptrend = @ , @ , @ , respectively ) .
Result	Greater walking pace was also associated with a higher short-term fractal scaling exponent ( Ptrend = @ ) and lower Poincar ratio ( Ptrend = @ ) , markers of less erratic sinus patterns .
Conclusion	Greater total leisure-time activity , and walking alone , as well , were prospectively associated with more favorable and specific indices of autonomic function in older adults , including several suggestive of more normal circadian fluctuations and less erratic sinoatrial firing .
Conclusion	Our results suggest potential mechanisms that might contribute to lower cardiovascular mortality with habitual physical activity later in life .

Background	Effects of palm olein ( POL ) on calcium and fat metabolic balance and gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerance have been clinically evaluated but its use in combination with palm kernel oil ( PKO ) , and canola oil has not been similarly assessed in infants .
Method	Calcium and fat balance and GI tolerance were evaluated in @ healthy term infants ( age = @-@ d ) in a randomized , double-blinded , @ d crossover trial at a day care center in Salvador , Brazil ; followed by a @d hospital ward metabolic balance study in @ of the male subjects .
Method	The study compared two commercially available milk-based powdered formulas in Brazil ; one containing POL ( @ % of total fat ) , PKO ( @ % ) and canola oil ( @ % ) as predominant fats ( PALM ) , and the other containing none ( NoPALM ) .
Method	Occasional human milk ( HM ) supplementation was allowed at home .
Result	Formula and HM intakes , and growth were not different ( p > @ ) .
Result	Calcium absorption ( % ) for infants fed NoPALM ( @ @ % ; means SD ) was higher ( p = @ ) than those fed PALM ( @ @ % ) , but was not significant ( p = @ ) when calcium intake was used as a covariate .
Result	Calcium intake was higher ( p < @ ) in NoPALM versus PALM fed infants .
Result	However , calcium retention ( % ) was higher in infants fed NoPALM compared to PALM with ( p = @ ) or without ( p = @ ) calcium intake as a covariate .
Result	Fat absorption ( % ) for NoPALM was greater than PALM fed infants ( NoPALM = @ @ > PALM = @ @ ; p = @ in Study Period I ) .
Result	Mean rank stool consistency was softer in infants fed NoPALM versus PALM ( p < @ ; metabolic period ) .
Result	Adverse events , spit-up/vomit , fussiness and gassiness were not different ( p > @ ) .
Result	Formula acceptability was high and comparable for both formula feedings , regardless of HM supplementation .
Conclusion	Term infants fed PALM based formula ( containing palm olein , palm kernel and canola oils ) demonstrated lower calcium retention and fat absorption , and less softer stool consistency versus infants fed NoPALM based formula .
Conclusion	Study suggested formula fat differences may affect GI function in infants .

Background	With both a high need for recovery ( NFR ) and overweight and obesity being a potential burden for organizations ( e.g. productivity loss and sickness absence ) , the aim of this paper was to examine the associations between overweight and obesity and several other health measures and NFR in office workers .
Method	Baseline data of @ office employees participating in a randomised controlled trial aimed at improving NFR in office workers were used .
Method	Associations between self-reported BMI categories ( normal body weight , overweight , obesity ) and several other health measures ( general health , mental health , sleep quality , stress and vitality ) with NFR were examined .
Method	Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression analyses were performed and adjusted for age , education and job demands .
Method	In addition , we adjusted for general health in the association between overweight and obesity and NFR .
Result	A significant positive association was observed between stress and NFR ( B = @ , @ % CI :@ -@ ) .
Result	General health , mental health , sleep quality and vitality were negatively associated with NFR ( p < @ ) .
Result	Analyses also showed a significant positive association between obesity and NFR ( B = @ , @ % CI :@ -@ ) , but not between overweight and NFR .
Conclusion	The findings suggest that self-reported stress is , and obesity may be , associated with a higher NFR .
Conclusion	Additionally , the results imply that health measures that indicate a better health are associated with a lower NFR .

Background	An established multivariate serum protein test can be used to classify patients according to whether they are likely to have a good or poor outcome after treatment with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors .
Background	We assessed the predictive power of this test in the comparison of erlotinib and chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer .
Method	From Feb @ , @ , to April @ , @ , patients ( aged @ years ) with histologically or cytologically confirmed , second-line , stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in @ centres in Italy .
Method	Patients were stratified according to a minimisation algorithm by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status , smoking history , centre , and masked pretreatment serum protein test classification , and randomly assigned centrally in a @:@ ratio to receive erlotinib ( @ mg/day , orally ) or chemotherapy ( pemetrexed @ mg/m ( @ ) , intravenously , every @ days , or docetaxel @ mg/m ( @ ) , intravenously , every @ days ) .
Method	The proteomic test classification was masked for patients and investigators who gave treatments , and treatment allocation was masked for investigators who generated the proteomic classification .
Method	The primary endpoint was overall survival and the primary hypothesis was the existence of a significant interaction between the serum protein test classification and treatment .
Method	Analyses were done on the per-protocol population .
Method	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	@ patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy and @ to erlotinib , and @ ( @ % ) and @ ( @ % ) , respectively , were included in the per-protocol analysis .
Result	@ ( @ % ) patients in the chemotherapy group and @ ( @ % ) in the erlotinib group had a proteomic test classification of good .
Result	Median overall survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the chemotherapy group and @ months ( @-@ ) in the erlotinib group .
Result	We noted a significant interaction between treatment and proteomic classification ( pinteraction = @ when adjusted for stratification factors ; pinteraction = @ when unadjusted for stratification factors ) .
Result	Patients with a proteomic test classification of poor had worse survival on erlotinib than on chemotherapy ( hazard ratio @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatments for patients with a proteomic test classification of good ( adjusted HR @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	In the group of patients who received chemotherapy , the most common grade @ or @ toxic effect was neutropenia ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs one -LSB- < @ % -RSB- in the erlotinib group ) , whereas skin toxicity ( one -LSB- < @ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) was the most frequent in the erlotinib group .
Conclusion	Our findings indicate that serum protein test status is predictive of differential benefit in overall survival for erlotinib versus chemotherapy in the second-line setting .
Conclusion	Patients classified as likely to have a poor outcome have better outcomes on chemotherapy than on erlotinib .

Background	Daylight-mediated photodynamic therapy ( DL-PDT ) using methyl-@-aminolaevulinate ( MAL ) is effective for thin , grade I , actinic keratoses ( AK ) .
Background	There are no published studies of other photosensitizers used in DL-PDT .
Problem	To compare the efficacy and adverse effects of @-aminolaevulinic acid nanoemulsion ( BF-@ ALA ) with MAL in DL-PDT of grade I-III AKs .
Method	In @ patients , @ AKs were randomized symmetrically for a split-face prospective observer-blinded study and received either BF-@ ALA or MAL DL-PDT .
Method	Grade I AKs were treated once and grade II-III AKs twice with a @-mm layer of photosensitizer precursors .
Method	Pain was assessed during and after the daylight exposure .
Method	Efficacy at @months was assessed clinically and histologically .
Result	BF-@ ALA cleared @/@ ( @ % ) and MAL @/@ ( @ % ) of the AKs ( P = @ ) , all grades responding equally , but with new AKs appearing during follow-up ( n = @ , BF-@ ALA ; n = @ , MAL ) .
Result	In per patient half-face analysis BF-@ ALA showed significantly higher clearance rates for grade I AKs than did MAL ( P = @ ) , but for thicker grades , clearance was equal ( P = @ ) .
Result	BF-@ ALA and MAL treatments resulted in @ % and @ % complete histological clearance ( P = @ ) , respectively .
Result	p@ expression decreased by @ % and @ % , respectively ( P = @ ) .
Result	Both treatments were nearly painless with similar adverse reactions and no difference in patient preference .
Conclusion	BF-@ ALA showed a trend towards improved efficacy results compared with MAL .
Conclusion	Thicker lesions in both groups responded when treated repeatedly .
Conclusion	Importantly , a thin @-mm layer of the photosensitizer precursors was sufficient , which may lead to lower expense .

Problem	To assess the most effective local analgesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy .
Method	A total of @ consecutive patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and/or a suspicious digital rectal examination were randomized to three groups .
Method	Patients received a @-mg lidocaine suppository ( group @ , n = @ ) , a periprostatic nerve block ( @-mL injection of lidocaine hydrochloride ; group @ , n = @ ) or a combination of both ( group @ , n = @ ) before a @-core transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy .
Method	A total of @ % ( n = @ ) of the patients underwent their first biopsy , @ % ( n = @ ) their second and @ % ( n = @ ) the third .
Method	Pain was evaluated on a @-point visual analog scale for each step of the procedure .
Result	Prostate-specific antigen values ranged from @ to @ ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- @ ng/mL -LSB- @ ng/mL -RSB- ) .
Result	Comparison of the median visual analog scale scores between groups @ and @ showed a significant difference ( P = @ ) .
Result	The differences in the outcomes between groups @ and @ ( P = @ ) , and groups @ and @ ( P = @ ) were also significant .
Result	Patients of group @ had the best output corresponding to the pain sensations and therefore the lowest visual analog scale scores .
Conclusion	The combination of lidocaine suppository and periprostatic lidocaine infiltration is more effective for pain control than either lidocaine suppository or periprostatic lidocaine infiltration alone in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy .

Result	Despite a median @ % increase in total plasma DHA levels after @ months , the DHA group was not rated as improved in core symptoms of autism compared to the placebo group on the CGI-I .
Result	Based on the analysis of covariance models adjusted for the baseline rating scores , parents ( but not teachers ) provided a higher average rating of social skills on the BASC for the children in the placebo group compared to the DHA group ( P = @ ) , and teachers ( but not parents ) provided a higher average rating of functional communication on the BASC for the children in the DHA group compared to the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Dietary DHA supplementation of @ mg/day for @ months does not improve the core symptoms of autism .
Conclusion	Our results may have been limited by inadequate sample size .

Problem	To test the application in practice of computerized fetal heart rate ( FHR ) analysis in pregnancy .
Method	Randomized distribution of subjects with computerized analysis automatically revealed or concealed .
Method	A district general hospital and a teaching hospital outside London .
Method	@ pregnant women studied within a year .
Method	Quality and duration of the cardiotocogram ; quantitative measurement of FHR variation ; number of stillbirths .
Result	With interactive advice to the operator , records were of improved quality ( up to @ % without signal loss ) with potentially much reduced recording time .

Problem	To study changes in the nuclear factor-B p@ ( NF-B p@ ) - inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) - nitric oxide ( NO ) signaling pathway and the effects of Xinfeng capsules ( XFC ) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) .
Method	One hundred twenty patients with AS were randomly divided into an XFC group and a Salazopyrin group .
Method	Sixty health subjects were included as a normal control group .
Method	In the two treatment groups , pulmonary functional parameters , forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) , maximal voluntary ventilation ( MVV ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , forced expiratory flow at @ % of forced vital capacity ( FEF@ ) , forced expiratory flow at @ % of forced vital capacity ( FEF@ ) , and forced expiratory flow at @ % of forced vital capacity ( FEF@ ) were determined .
Method	Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were used for detection of the serum oxidative stress indexes , NF-B p@ , iNOS , NO , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , total antioxidative capacity ( TAOC ) and interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) , IL-@ , IL-@ , and tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) contents .
Method	Westergren 's method was used for determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) .
Method	High-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Hs-CRP ) was detected with a @ full-automatic biochemical analyzer ( Hitachi , Japan ) .
Result	The clinical therapeutic effect in the XFC group was significantly superior to that in the Salazopyrin group ( P < @ ) .
Result	Compared with the normal control group , FEV@ , MVV , PEF , FEF@ , FEF@ , SOD , CAT , TAOC , IL-@ , IL-@ were significantly lower , and NF-B p@ , iNOS , NO , ROS , RNS , MDA , IL-@ , TNF - , ESR , and Hs-CRP significantly higher in patients with AS ( P < @ or P < @ ) .
Result	Compared with before treatment , FEV@ , MVV , PEF , FEF@ , FEF@ , SOD , CAT , TAOC , IL-@ , and IL-@ were significantly increased , and NF-B p@ , iNOS , NO , ROS , RNS , MDA , IL-@ , TNF - , ESR , CRP , visual analog scales ( VAS ) , Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease active index , Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index , and Bath ankylosing spondylitis global index significantly decreased in the two treatment groups after treatment ( P < .
Result	@ or P < @ ) , with significant differences between the XFC and Salazopyrin groups ( P < @ or P < @ ) .
Result	Spearman correlation analysis indicated that FEV@ , MWVV , PEF , FEF@ , and FEF@ were positively correlated with SOD , CAT , TAOC , IL-@ , and IL-@ , and were negatively correlated with NF-B p@ , iNOS , NO , ROS , RNS , MDA , IL-@ , TNF - , ESR , and CRP .
Conclusion	Patients with AS have local pathologic changes in the spinal cord and other joints .
Conclusion	They also have decreased pulmonary function , which is negatively correlated with the NF-B-iNOS-NO signaling pathway , oxidative indexes , and inflammatory factors .
Conclusion	XFC improves rigidity and pain in spinal joints and other symptoms , laboratory indexes , and pulmonary function .
Conclusion	The mechanism is possibly related to inhibition of the NF-KB-iNOS-NO signaling pathway .

Problem	Combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a long-acting - agonist has been shown to be pharmacologically useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
Problem	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the dual bronchodilator therapy on airway dimensions in COPD .
Method	Patients ( n = @ ) were randomly assigned to receive tiotropium ( @g once daily ) , indacaterol ( @g once daily ) or tiotropium plus indacaterol for @ weeks .
Method	Quantitative computed tomography ( CT ) , pulmonary function and health status ( St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ) were measured .
Result	Compared with tiotropium or indacaterol alone , combination therapy resulted in a significant decrease in percentage wall area ( WA % ) and wall thickness , corrected for body surface area , and an increase in luminal area ( Ai/BSA ) .
Result	Concurrent treatment was superior to monotherapy in physiological indices , including forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in @s ( FEV ) and inspiratory capacity .
Result	The changes in WA % and Ai/BSA were significantly correlated with changes in FEV ( r = -@ , P < @ and r = @ , P < @ ) .
Result	There were more significant improvements in SGRQ scores after treatment with combined therapy than with either treatment alone .
Conclusion	Concurrent therapy with tiotropium and indacaterol is effective for COPD patients to promote reduction in airway wall thickness , bronchodilation , and improvements in lung function compared with a single inhaler .

Background	Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) is an important source of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) .
Background	However , the concentration of cells in cord blood units is limited and this may represent the main restriction to their therapeutic clinical use .
Background	The percentage of metabolically active stem cells provides a measure of the viability of cells in an UCB sample .
Background	It follows that an active cellular metabolism causes a proliferation in stem cells , offering an opportunity to increase the cellular concentration .
Background	A high cell dose is essential when transplanting cord stem cells , guaranteeing , in the receiving patient , a successful outcome.This study is designed to evaluate the impact of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) supplementation in pregnant women , in order to increase the quantity and viability of the cells in UCB samples .
Method	The metabolic demand of DHA increases in the course of pregnancy and reaches maximum absorption during the third trimester of pregnancy .
Method	According to these observations , this trial will be divided into two different experimental groups : in the first group , participants will be enrolled from the @th week of estimated stage of gestation , before the maximum absorption of DHA ; while in the second group , enrolment will start from the @th week of estimated stage of gestation , when the DHA request is higher .
Method	Participants in the trial will be divided and randomly assigned to the placebo group or to the experimental group .
Method	Each participant will receive a complete set of capsules of either placebo ( @ mg of olive oil ) or DHA ( @ mg ) , to take one a day from the @th or from the @th week , up to the @th week of estimated gestational age .
Method	Samples of venous blood will be taken from all participants before taking placebo or DHA , at the @th or at the @th week , and at the @th to @th week of pregnancy to monitor the level of DHA .
Method	Cell number and cellular viability will be evaluated by flow cytometry within @ hours of the UCB sample collection .

Problem	The aim of this study is to systematically investigate under standardized experimental conditions the effects of instrument contamination and wear on the quality of bipolar vessel sealing ( BVS ) achieved using a reusable instrument .
Method	The study was designed as a prospective , randomized , and controlled in vitro study and conducted in an academic research environment .
Method	Reusable bipolar coagulation forceps ( BiClamp @ C , ERBE Elektromedizin ) were used to apply sealing pressures of @-@ ,@ mN/mm ( @ ) to @ renal arteries from commercially slaughtered female pigs ( Swabian-Hall Swine ) .
Method	Forceps jaws were coated with porcine blood , blood and collagen , or blood , collagen , and fat to simulate instrument contamination with biological material during surgery .
Method	Clinical wear was mimicked by sandpaper abrasion .
Method	The main outcome measures were seal success ( resistance to @ mmHg intraluminal pressure for @ min ) and seal stability ( burst pressure ) .
Result	Sealing pressure had a significant impact , with @ mN/mm ( @ ) producing the best sealing results .
Result	Seal success increased with total energy applied to the tissue , a higher maximum temperature , and longer coagulation as indicated by desiccation time .
Result	Experimental contamination had no significant impact on seal success and only a limited effect on seal stability .
Result	Similarly , abrasive wear also had no significant effect on either seal quality or seal strength .
Conclusion	The impact of bipolar forceps contamination and wear on seal success and quality was negligible in our in vitro model .
Conclusion	To achieve high-quality seals , it is essential to use adequate sealing pressures .
Conclusion	Our findings could have direct implications for the design and clinical handling of BVS instruments .

Problem	To develop and validate composite disease activity scores , based on widely available clinical measures , that would demonstrate improved correlation with detection of synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and radiographic progression , in comparison with conventional measures , in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
Method	This study was conducted as a secondary study of @ RA clinical trials , GO-BEFORE ( development cohort ) and GO-FORWARD ( validation cohort ) .
Method	Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate independent cross-sectional associations of component variables ( from all time points ) with concurrent MRI measures of synovitis and bone edema in the development cohort .
Method	Based on regression coefficients , modified versions of the Disease Activity Score in @ joints ( M-DAS@ ) , Simplified Disease Activity Index ( M-SDAI ) , and Clinical Disease Activity Index ( M-CDAI ) were generated for each subject in the validation cohort .
Method	The M-DAS@ , M-SDAI , and M-CDAI scores were compared to conventional scores of disease activity with regard to associations with MRI measures of synovitis and radiographic progression , assessed using Pearson 's and Spearman 's correlations , linear/logistic regression , and receiver operating characteristic analysis .
Result	Four variables were independently associated with MRI-detected synovitis and bone edema in the development cohort : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , swollen joint count in @ joints ( SJC@ ) , and evaluator 's global assessment of disease activity using a visual analog scale ( EvGA score ) .
Result	Modified disease activity scores were generated using the regression coefficients obtained in the synovitis models for all subjects in the validation cohort ; modified scores were calculated as M-DAS@ = @ ln ( CRP ) + @ SJC@ + @ EvGA + @ and M-SDAI = CRP + SJC@ + EvGA .
Result	Both modified and conventional disease activity scores correlated significantly with MRI measures of synovitis .
Result	Modified scores showed superior correlation with synovitis , as compared to conventional scores , at all time points ( P < @ ) .
Result	Furthermore , the M-DAS@ and M-SDAI had superior test characteristics for prediction of radiographic progression at @ weeks ( both P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Modified disease activity scores demonstrated superior correlation with MRI detection of synovitis at all time points , and more accurately predicted radiographic progression in patients with RA in a clinical trial setting .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of massage therapy compared with occlusal splint therapy on mandibular range of motion ( ROM ) in individuals with temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) and compare the results with ROM obtained in a group of individuals without this disorder .
Method	A blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted .
Method	Twenty-eight volunteers with TMD were randomly distributed into either a massage therapy group or an occlusal splint group .
Method	Both treatments were provided for @ weeks .
Method	Fourteen individuals without TMD were consecutively allocated to a comparison group .
Method	Fonseca anamnestic index was used to characterize TMD and allocate the volunteers to either of the intervention groups or asymptomatic comparison group .
Method	Mandibular ROM was evaluated before and after treatment using a digital caliper .
Method	Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with a post hoc Bonferroni testing was used for intergroup and intragroup comparisons ( level of significance was set to @ % ) .
Method	Cohen d was used to calculate the effect size .
Result	In the intragroup analysis , significant increases in ROM were found for all measures in both the massage and occlusal splint groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	A small to moderate clinical effect of treatment with the occlusal splint was found regarding right and left lateral excursion in comparison with the massage therapy and asymptomatic comparison groups ( @ < d < @ ) .
Conclusion	Massage therapy on the masticatory muscles and the use of an occlusal splint lead to an increase in mandibular ROM similar to that of the asymptomatic comparison group with regard to maximum active mouth opening and both right and left excursion in individuals with TMD .

Problem	The present study aimed to compare the postoperative contrast sensitivity functions between wavefront-guided LASIK eyes and their contralateral wavefront-guided PRK eyes .
Method	The participants were @ healthy subjects ( mean age = @ @ years ) who had myopic astigmatism .
Method	The spatial contrast sensitivity functions were measured before and three times after the surgery .
Method	Psycho and a Cambridge graphic board ( VSG @/@ ) were used to measure luminance , red-green , and blue-yellow spatial contrast sensitivity functions ( from @ to @ cycles/degree ) .
Method	Longitudinal analysis and comparison between surgeries were performed .
Result	There was no significant contrast sensitivity change during the one-year follow-up measurements neither for LASIK nor for PRK eyes .
Result	The comparison between procedures showed no differences at @ months postoperative .
Conclusion	The present data showed similar contrast sensitivities during one-year follow-up of wave-front guided refractive surgeries .
Conclusion	Moreover , one year postoperative data showed no differences in the effects of either wavefront-guided LASIK or wavefront-guided PRK on the luminance and chromatic spatial contrast sensitivity functions .

Problem	Prevention research has to elucidate how families with overweight children can be convinced to participate in obesity intervention trials .
Problem	Here we describe the detailed recruitment process for a telephone-based obesity prevention programme for families with overweight children and present participation rates , the study design and a socio-demographic description of participating families .
Method	Overweight ( BMI > @th percentile ) children and adolescents @-@ years of age were screened via the German paediatrician network CrescNet .
Method	The prevention programme ( multiple computer aided telephone counselling interviews ) was suggested to eligible families via local paediatricians .
Method	Participating families were compared anthropometrically and socio-demographically to the entire screening population and to micro-census data , a representative national survey .
Result	The screening process assessed @ candidates for eligibility .
Result	Paediatricians reported having suggested programme participation to @ candidates ( referred to as @ % ) .
Result	@ candidates ( @ % ) returned a written consent for programme participation .
Result	@ candidates ( @ % ) started the intervention .
Result	The study population ( n = @ ) included more obese ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) and fewer overweight participants ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) than the entire screening population .
Result	Compared to the micro-census , families with adolescents ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) and single parents ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) were underrepresented in the study population , whereas families living in rural areas were overrepresented ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Although @ % of the paediatricians forwarded the suggestion for programme participation to eligible families , participation rates for this low-threshold ; telephone-based obesity intervention remained very low .
Conclusion	`` Hard-to-engage groups '' for effective obesity prevention seem to include single parents , as well as parents of adolescents .

Problem	To assess over a @-month period functional results of the modified INTRACOR femtosecond laser-based intrastromal procedure to treat presbyopia .
Method	@ eyes of @ presbyopic patients with mild hyperopia were included .
Method	The INTRACOR procedure with a modified pattern ( six concentric intrastromal ring cuts ) was performed using the FEMTEC femtosecond laser ( Bausch + Lomb/Technolas Perfect Vision , Munich , Germany ) .
Method	Patients were also randomly divided into three subgroups to compare the effect of three different small inner ring diameters ( @ / @ / @ mm ( Groups A/B/C ) ) .
Method	Follow-up examinations were performed at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ and @months , and included near and distance visual acuity tests , slit-lamp examinations and corneal topography .
Result	Median uncorrected near visual acuity ( UNVA ) increased from @ / @ / @ logMAR ( Groups A/B/C ) to -@ / @ / @ logMAR @months after surgery .
Result	Uncorrected distance visual acuity changed slightly from @ / @ / @ logMAR to @ / @ / @ logMAR .
Result	Losses of two lines of binocular corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA ) were noted in @/@/@ % of eyes .
Result	Median spherical equivalent changed from @ / @ / @ dioptres to -@ / @ / -@ dioptres .
Result	Overall patient satisfaction with the procedure was @ % .
Conclusion	INTRACOR with a modified pattern improved UNVA in all patients over a @-month follow-up period .
Conclusion	The possibility of reduced CDVA underlines the need for careful patient selection .

Background	The incidence of chronic pain is higher among immigrants in Europe than among the native European population .
Background	Therapeutic interventions in this population are far less effective than in patients for whom these programmes were originally developed .
Problem	In a randomised trial , we investigated whether a cognitive behavioural treatment ( CBT ) programme supplemented with culturally sensitive aspects ( CsCBT ) improves pain intensity , pain disability and quality of life among immigrant patients , compared with a treatment of culturally sensitive exercise therapy ( CsET ) alone .
Problem	Furthermore , we investigated whether healthcare costs would decrease .
Method	First-generation Turkish immigrants residing in Switzerland ( @-@ years of age ) who suffered from chronic pain were enrolled in the trial .
Method	Patients were randomised to attend either CsCBT or CsET .
Method	The CsCBT intervention was based upon a manualised cognitive-behavioural group treatment programme for chronic pain patients and adapted to the needs of a Turkish immigrant population .
Method	The CsET intervention was based on principles of exercise therapy for treatment of nonspecific low back pain .
Result	A total of @ outpatients were recruited between October @ and November @ .
Result	The intervention was completed by @ patients ( @ % ) .
Result	A total of @ subjects ( @ % ) completed follow-up , @ months after the completion of the intervention programme .
Result	The intervention showed no effects in reducing pain , pain disability or quality of life .
Result	The analysis of healthcare utilisation yielded no intervention effect .
Conclusion	Cognitive behavioural intervention is feasible with immigrants with chronic disabling pain , but the evidence-based CBT programme , as well as exercise therapy supplemented with culturally sensitive aspects , showed no improvement .

Background	Glucose measurement in intensive care medicine is performed intermittently with the risk of undetected hypoglycemia .
Background	The workload for the ICU nursing staff is substantial .
Background	Subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) systems are available and may be able to solve some of these issues in critically ill patients .
Method	In a randomized controlled design in a mixed ICU in a teaching hospital we compared the use of subcutaneous CGM with frequent point of care ( POC ) to guide insulin treatment .
Method	Adult critically ill patients with an expected stay of more than @ hours and in need of insulin therapy were included .
Method	All patients received subcutaneous CGM .
Method	CGM data were blinded in the control group , whereas in the intervention group these data were used to feed a computerized glucose regulation algorithm .
Method	The same algorithm was used in the control group fed by intermittent POC glucose measurements .
Method	Safety was assessed with the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( < @ mmol/L ) , efficacy with the percentage time in target range ( @ to @ mmol/L ) .
Method	In addition , we assessed nursing workload and costs .
Result	In this study , @ patients were randomized to the intervention and @ to the control group .
Result	CGM device failure resulted in @ and @ patients for analysis .
Result	The incidence of severe glycemia and percentage of time within target range was similar in both groups .
Result	A significant reduction in daily nursing workload for glucose control was found in the intervention group ( @ versus @ minutes ; P < @ ) .
Result	Mean daily costs per patient were significantly reduced with EUR @ ( @ % CI -@ to -@ , P = @ ) in the intervention group .
Conclusion	Subcutaneous CGM to guide insulin treatment in critically ill patients is as safe and effective as intermittent point-of-care measurements and reduces nursing workload and daily costs .
Conclusion	A new algorithm designed for frequent measurements may lead to improved performance and should precede clinical implementation .

Background	Epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent associations of vitamin D and prostate cancer risk ; however , few have adequately controlled for detection bias related to prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening , and the results of many studies may be affected by occult prostate cancers among controls .
Method	Data for this nested case-control analysis ( n = @,@ cases/@ ,@ controls ) are from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial .
Method	Baseline serum was analyzed for @-hydroxyvitamin D -LSB- @ ( OH ) D -RSB- .
Method	The presence or absence of cancer was subsequently determined by prostate biopsy .
Method	Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of @ ( OH ) D with risk of total , Gleason @-@ , Gleason @ , and Gleason @-@ prostate cancer .
Method	Results are presented for placebo and finasteride arms separately and combined .
Result	There were no associations of serum @ ( OH ) D with total prostate cancer risk .
Result	For Gleason @-@ cancers , results were inconsistent across treatment arms with a suggestion of increased risk in the placebo arm only ; however , there was no dose-response relationship .
Result	For Gleason @-@ prostate cancers , @ ( OH ) D concentrations were associated with a linear decrease in risk among combined treatment arms -LSB- quartile @ vs. @ : OR , @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) , @-@ @ ; P ( trend ) = @ -RSB- .
Result	These findings were somewhat stronger among men @ versus @-@ years at baseline ( quartile @ vs. @ : OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ vs. OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ , respectively ; P ( interaction ) = @ ) .
Conclusion	Higher serum @ ( OH ) D may modestly increase risk of Gleason @-@ disease and more substantially reduce risk of Gleason @-@ prostate cancer .
Conclusion	Vitamin D may have different effects for different stages of prostate cancers .

Background	Oxaliplatin is an integral component of colorectal cancer treatment , but its use is limited by neurotoxicity .
Background	The Combined Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial ( CONcePT ) tested intermittent oxaliplatin ( IO ) administration and the use of concurrent calcium and magnesium salts ( Ca/Mg ) , two modifications intended to reduce neurotoxicity and extend the duration of treatment .
Method	In this trial involving double randomization , @ patients were randomized to receive modified FOLFOX@ plus bevacizumab with IO ( eight-cycle blocks of oxaliplatin treatment ) versus continuous oxaliplatin ( CO ) ; and Ca/Mg versus placebo ( pre - and postoxaliplatin infusion ) .
Method	The primary end point was time-to-treatment failure ( TTF ) .
Result	One hundred thirty-nine patients were entered and treated up to the point of early study termination due to concerns by the data-monitoring committee ( DMC ) that Ca/Mg adversely affected tumor response .
Result	Tumor response was not a study end point .
Result	Given DMC concerns , an additional independent , blinded radiology review of all images showed no adverse effect of treatment schedule or Ca/Mg on response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors .
Result	The IO schedule was superior to CO -LSB- hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ , P = @ -RSB- for both TTF and time-to-tumor progression ( TTP ) ( HR = @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	An IO dosing schedule had a significant benefit on both TTF and TTP versus CO dosing in this trial despite the very attenuated sample .
Conclusion	There was no effect of Ca/Mg on response .

Background	Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) is a very disabling condition with a chronic course , if left untreated .
Background	Though cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT ) with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) is the method of choice , up to one third of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) do not respond to treatment in terms of at least @ % improvement of symptoms .
Background	Mindfulness based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) is an @-week group program that could help OCD patients with no or only partial response to CBT to reduce OC symptoms and develop a helpful attitude towards obsessions and compulsive urges .
Method	This study is a prospective , bicentric , assessor-blinded , randomized , actively-controlled clinical trial .
Method	@ patients with primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV and no or only partial response to CBT will be recruited from in - and outpatient services as well as online forums and the media .
Method	Patients will be randomized to either an MBCT intervention group or to a psycho-educative coaching group ( OCD-EP ) as an active control condition .
Method	All participants will undergo eight weekly sessions with a length of @ minutes each of a structured group program .
Method	We hypothesize that MBCT will be superior to OCD-EP in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) following the intervention and at @ - and @-months-follow-up .
Method	Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms , quality of life , metacognitive beliefs , self-compassion , mindful awareness and approach-avoidance tendencies as measured by an approach avoidance task .
Conclusion	The results of this study will elucidate the benefits of MBCT for OCD patients who did not sufficiently benefit from CBT .
Conclusion	To our knowledge , this is the first randomized controlled study assessing the effects of MBCT on symptom severity and associated parameters in OCD .

Background	The large placebo effect observed in prior acupuncture trials presents a substantial challenge for interpretation of the efficacy of acupuncture .
Background	We sought to evaluate the relationship between response expectancy , a key component of the placebo effect over time , and treatment outcome in real and sham electroacupuncture ( EA ) .
Method	We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial of EA and sham acupuncture ( SA ) for joint pain attributable to aromatase inhibitors among women with breast cancer .
Method	Responders were identified using the Patient Global Impression of Change instrument at Week @ ( end of intervention ) .
Method	The Acupuncture Expectancy Scale ( AES ) was used to measure expectancy four times during the trial .
Method	Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between expectancy and treatment response .
Result	In the wait list control group , AES remained unchanged over treatment .
Result	In the SA group , Baseline AES was significantly higher in responders than nonresponders ( @ vs @ , P = @ ) and AES did not change over time .
Result	In the EA group , Baseline AES scores did not differ between responders and nonresponders ( @ vs @ , P = @ ) ; however , AES increased in responders compared with nonresponders over time ( P = @ for responder and time interaction term ) with significant difference at the end of trial for responders versus nonresponders ( @ vs @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Baseline higher response expectancy predicts treatment response in SA , but not in EA .
Conclusion	Divergent mechanisms may exist for how SA and EA influence pain outcomes , and patients with low expectancy may do better with EA than SA .

Background	In this randomized trial , Project CARE , we examined whether participation in a cognitive-behavioral stress management and breast cancer wellness and education program improved psychological outcomes among a sample of underserved black breast cancer survivors .
Method	Both complementary medicine interventions were @-sessions , manualized , group-based , and were culturally adapted for black women in the community from evidence-based interventions .
Method	Participants were @ black women ( mean age = @ , @-@ years ) who had completed breast cancer treatment @-@ months before enrollment ( stages @-IV , mean time since cancer diagnosis = @ months ) .
Method	Women were enrolled upon completion of curative treatment ( ie , surgical , chemotherapy , radiation oncology ) and randomized to receive cognitive-behavioral stress management or cancer wellness and education program .
Result	There was a remarkable @ % retention rate from baseline to @-month follow-up .
Result	Participants in both conditions showed statistically significant improvement on indices of psychological well-being , including overall quality of life ( Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast ) , intrusive thoughts ( Impact of Event Scale-Revised ) , depressive symptoms ( Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression ) , and stress levels ( Perceived Stress Scale ) over the @-month postintervention follow-up ( all repeated measures analysis of variance within-subjects time effects : P < @ , except for overall mood ; Profile of Mood States-Short Version ) .
Result	Contrary to hypotheses , however , condition time effects were not statistically significant .
Conclusion	Findings suggest that improvements in multiple measures over time may have been due to intensive training in stress management , extensive provision of breast cancer information , or participation in an ongoing supportive group of individuals from a similar racial background .
Conclusion	Implications bear on decisions about appropriate control groups , the timing of intervention delivery during the treatment trajectory , and perceived support from the research team .

Background	Continuous theta burst stimulation ( cTBS ) of the human primary motor cortex ( M@ ) induces long-term depression ( LTD ) - like plastic changes in corticospinal excitability , but several studies have reported high inter-subject variability of this effect .
Background	Most studies use a tonic voluntary contraction of the target muscle before cTBS to set stimulation intensity ; however , it is unclear how this might affect response variability .
Problem	To examine the influence of pre-activation of the target hand muscle on inter-subject response variability to cTBS of the human M@ .
Method	The response to cTBS was assessed by changes in motor evoked potential ( MEP ) amplitude in the right first dorsal interosseous ( FDI ) muscle .
Method	For Study @ , ten healthy subjects attended two sessions .
Method	They were instructed in one session to keep their FDI relaxed for the entire testing period ( pre-relax ) , and in the other to perform a @-min @ % of maximal voluntary tonic contraction @ min before cTBS ( pre-active ) .
Method	For Study @ , data from our previous study were re-analyzed to extend the pre-relax condition to an additional @ subjects ( total n = @ ) .
Result	cTBS-induced highly consistent LTD-like MEP depression in the pre-relax condition , but not in the pre-active condition .
Result	Inter-subject response variability increased in the pre-active condition .
Conclusion	cTBS induces consistent LTD-like plasticity with low inter-subject variability if pre-activation of the stimulated motor cortex is avoided .
Conclusion	This affirms a translational potential of cTBS in clinical applications that aim at reducing cortical excitability .

Problem	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ospemifene , a novel selective oestrogen receptor modulator , in the treatment of vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy ( VVA ) .
Method	A @ week , multicentre , randomised , double-blind , parallel-group phase III study of women ( @-@ years ) with VVA and self-reported vaginal dryness as their most bothersome symptom .
Method	The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline to Week @ in ( @ ) percentage of parabasal cells in the maturation index ( MI ) , ( @ ) percentage of superficial cells in the MI , ( @ ) vaginal pH , and ( @ ) severity of vaginal dryness .
Method	Safety assessments included physical examination , cervical Papanicolaou test and clinical laboratory analyses .
Method	Endometrial thickness and histology was also assessed .
Result	A total of @ women were randomised to once-daily ospemifene @ mg/day ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
Result	Significant improvements in the percentages of parabasal and superficial cells in the MI and vaginal pH were observed with ospemifene compared with placebo ( p < @ for all parameters ) .
Result	The mean change from baseline in severity score of vaginal dryness reported by women receiving ospemifene compared with those receiving placebo approached statistical significance ( p = @ ) .
Result	Improvements in each of the four co-primary endpoints with ospemifene were statistically significant compared to placebo in the per protocol population .
Result	The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events were considered mild to moderate in severity .
Conclusion	Once-daily oral ospemifene @ mg was effective for the treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness .

Problem	To evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapy of cryotherapy and sinecatechins @ % ointment BID versus cryotherapy alone in treatment of external genital warts ( EGW ) .
Method	Forty-two subjects with at least two EGW lesions underwent cryotherapy to all lesions .

Background	Radium-@ dichloride ( radium-@ ) selectively targets bone metastases with high-energy , short-range - particles .
Background	We assessed the effect of radium-@ compared with placebo in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases .
Method	In this phase @ , double-blind , randomised ALSYMPCA trial , we enrolled patients who had symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with two or more bone metastases and no known visceral metastases , who were receiving best standard of care , and had previously either received or were unsuitable for docetaxel .
Method	Patients were stratified by previous docetaxel use , baseline total alkaline phosphatase level , and current bisphosphonate use , then randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive either six intravenous injections of radium-@ ( @ kBq/kg ) or matching placebo ; one injection was given every @ weeks .
Method	Randomisation was done with an interactive voice response system , taking into account trial stratification factors .
Method	Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment .
Method	The primary endpoint was overall survival , which has been reported previously .
Method	Here we report on time to first symptomatic skeletal event , defined as the use of external beam radiation to relieve bone pain , or occurrence of a new symptomatic pathological fracture ( vertebral or non-verterbal ) , or occurence of spinal cord compression , or tumour-related orthopeadic surgical intervention .
Method	All events were required to be clinically apparent and were not assessed by periodic radiological review .
Method	Statistical analyses of symptomatic skeletal events were based on the intention-to-treat population .
Method	The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	Between June @ , @ , and Feb @ , @ , @ patients were enrolled , of whom @ ( @ % ) were randomly assigned to receive radium-@ and @ ( @ % ) placebo .
Result	Symptomatic skeletal events occurred in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the radium-@ group and @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the placebo group .
Result	Time to first symptomatic skeletal event was longer with radium-@ than with placebo ( median @ months -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- vs @ months -LSB- @-@ -RSB- ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- = @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
Result	The risks of external beam radiation therapy for bone pain ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) and spinal cord compression ( HR = @ , @ % CI @-@ ) were reduced with radium-@ compared with placebo .
Result	Radium-@ treatment did not seem to significantly reduce the risk of symptomatic pathological bone fracture ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) , or the need for tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ) .
Conclusion	Radium-@ should be considered as a treatment option for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and symptomatic bone metastases .

Background	Decreased ability of muscles to respond to anabolic stimuli is part of the underlying mechanism for muscle loss with aging .
Background	Previous studies suggest that substantial amounts of essential amino acids ( EAA ) , whey protein and leucine are beneficial for stimulation of acute muscle protein synthesis in older adults .
Background	However , these studies supplied only proteins , and no bolus studies have been done with dairy products or supplements that contained also fat and carbohydrates besides proteins .
Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a specifically designed nutritional supplement in older adults stimulates muscle protein synthesis acutely to a greater extent than a conventional dairy product .
Background	Moreover , the combined effect with resistance exercise was studied by using a unilateral resistance exercise protocol .
Method	Utilizing a randomized , controlled , double blind study design , healthy older adults received a single bolus of a high whey protein , leucine-enriched supplement ( EXP : @ g whey protein , @g total leucine , @ kcal ; n = @ ) or an iso-caloric milk protein control (
Method	@g milk protein ; n = @ ) , immediately after unilateral resistance exercise .
Method	Postprandial mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate ( FSR ) was measured over @h using a tracer infusion protocol with L - -LSB- ring-C -RSB- - phenylalanine and regular blood and muscle sampling .
Result	FSR was significantly higher overall after EXP ( @ % / h ) vs CONTROL ( @ % / h ( EMMSE ) ) ( p = @ ) .
Result	No interaction between treatment and exercise was observed ( p = @ ) .
Result	Higher postprandial concentrations of EAA and leucine are possible mediating factors for the FSR response , while plasma insulin increase did not dictate the FSR response .
Result	Moreover , when the protein intake from the supplements was expressed per kg leg lean mass ( LLM ) , a significant correlation was observed with resting postprandial FSR ( r = @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Ingestion of a high whey protein , leucine-enriched supplement resulted in a larger overall postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate in healthy older subjects compared with a conventional dairy product .
Conclusion	This acute effect is promising for long-term effects on parameters of muscle mass , strength and function in sarcopenic older people , which requires further study .

Background	Various devices have been developed to facilitate liver transection and reduce blood loss in liver resections .
Background	None of these has proven superiority compared with the classical clamp-crushing technique .
Background	This randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness and safety of stapler transection with that of clamp-crushing during open liver resection .
Method	Patients admitted for elective open liver resection between January @ and October @ were assigned randomly to stapler transection or the clamp-crushing technique .
Method	The primary endpoint was the total amount of intraoperative blood loss .
Method	Secondary endpoints included transection time , duration of operation , complication rates and resection margins .
Result	A total of @ patients were enrolled , @ to clamp-crushing and @ to stapler transection .
Result	There was no difference between groups in total intraoperative blood loss : median ( i.q.r. ) @ ( @-@ ) versus @ ( @-@ ) ml respectively ( P = @ ) .
Result	The difference in total intraoperative blood loss normalized to the transection surface area was not statistically significant ( P = @ ) .
Result	Blood loss during parenchymal transection was significantly lower in the stapler transection group ( P = @ ) , as were the parenchymal transection time ( mean ( s.d. ) @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) min for clamp-crushing and stapler transection groups respectively ; P < @ ) and total duration of operation ( mean ( s.d. ) @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) min ; P = @ ) .
Result	There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity ( P = @ ) or mortality ( P = @ ) between groups .
Conclusion	Stapler transection is a safe technique but does not reduce intraoperative blood loss in elective liver resection compared with the clamp-crushing technique .

Background	Proficiency and self-confidence in the physical examination is poor among internal medicine residents and interest in ultrasound technology has expanded .
Problem	We aimed to determine whether a pocket-sized ultrasound improves the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of residents after a @-h training session and @ month of independent practice .
Method	This was a randomized parallel group controlled trial .
Method	Forty internal medicine residents in a single program at an academic medical center participated in the study .
Method	Three hours of training on use of pocket-sized ultrasound was followed by @ month of independent practice .
Method	The primary outcome was a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of a physical exam alone versus a physical examination augmented with a pocket-sized ultrasound .
Method	Other outcomes included confidence in exam findings and a survey of attitudes towards the physical exam and the role of ultrasound .
Result	Residents in the intervention group using a pocket-sized ultrasound correctly identified an average of @ of the @ abnormal findings ( accuracy rate of @ % ) .
Result	Those in the control group correctly identified an average of @ abnormal findings ( accuracy rate of @ % , p = @ ) .
Result	Residents in the intervention group identified on average @ findings as abnormal when no abnormality existed ( false positive rate of @ % ) .
Result	Those in the control group incorrectly identified an average of @ positive findings ( false positive rate of @ % ) .
Result	There was no difference between groups regarding self-assessed confidence in physical examination .
Result	Residents in the intervention group identified @ of @ abnormal cardiac findings versus the control group 's @ of @ , an accuracy rate of @ % versus @ % ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The diagnostic ability of internal medicine residents did not significantly improve with use of a pocket-sized ultrasound device after a @-h training session and @ month of independent practice .

Problem	To test whether a brief mindfulness meditation training intervention buffers self-reported psychological and neuroendocrine responses to the Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ) in young adult volunteers .
Problem	A second objective evaluates whether pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness moderate the effects of brief mindfulness meditation training on stress reactivity .
Method	Sixty-six ( N = @ ) participants were randomly assigned to either a brief @-day ( @-min per day ) mindfulness meditation training or an analytic cognitive training control program .
Method	All participants completed a standardized laboratory social-evaluative stress challenge task ( the TSST ) following the third mindfulness meditation or cognitive training session .
Method	Measures of psychological ( stress perceptions ) and biological ( salivary cortisol , blood pressure ) stress reactivity were collected during the social evaluative stress-challenge session .
Result	Brief mindfulness meditation training reduced self-reported psychological stress reactivity but increased salivary cortisol reactivity to the TSST , relative to the cognitive training comparison program .
Result	Participants who were low in pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness and then received mindfulness meditation training had the greatest cortisol reactivity to the TSST .
Result	No significant main or interactive effects were observed for systolic or diastolic blood pressure reactivity to the TSST .
Conclusion	The present study provides an initial indication that brief mindfulness meditation training buffers self-reported psychological stress reactivity , but also increases cortisol reactivity to social evaluative stress .
Conclusion	This pattern may indicate that initially brief mindfulness meditation training fosters greater active coping efforts , resulting in reduced psychological stress appraisals and greater cortisol reactivity during social evaluative stressors .

Problem	The genetic polymorphism concerning the @-subunit of platelet integrin receptor glycoprotein IIIa is held responsible for enhanced binding of adhesive proteins resulting in increased thrombogenic potential .
Problem	Whether it is associated with mortality , HbA@c or platelet volume is tested prospectively in an epidemiological cohort .
Method	Population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg ( KORA ) S@-Survey ( N = @,@ ) was investigated for prognostic value of PLA@A@-polymorphism regarding all-cause mortality , correlation with HbA@c , and mean platelet volume .
Method	Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate association between genotype and key variables .
Result	Prevalence of thrombogenic allele variant PLA@ was @ % .
Result	Multivariate analysis revealed no association between PLA@A@ polymorphism and mortality in the KORA-cohort .
Result	HbA@c was a prognostic marker of mortality in non-diabetic persons resulting in J-shaped risk curve with dip at HbA@c = @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) , confirming previous findings regarding aged KORA-S@ participants ( @-@ years ) .
Result	PLA@A@ was significantly associated with elevated HbA@c levels in diabetic patients ( N = @ ) and reduced mean platelet volume in general population .
Result	In non-diabetic participants ( N = @,@ ) , carriers of PLA@ allele variant presenting with HbA@c > @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) showed higher relative risk of mortality with increasing HbA@c .
Conclusion	PLA@A@ polymorphism is associated with mortality in participants with HbA@c ranging from @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) to @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) .
Conclusion	Maintenance of euglycemic control and antiplatelet therapy are therefore regarded as effective primary prevention in this group .

Background	To follow up on a recent report from our lab -LSB- Hum Psychopharmacol @:@ -@ , @ . -RSB-
Background	we examined the effects of caffeine on salivary - amylase ( sAA ) activity in response to an engaging , non-stressful task in healthy young males ( age @-@ yrs ) who consumed caffeine on a daily basis .
Background	Using a placebo-controlled , double-blind , between-subjects design , @ men received either placebo , @ mg or @ mg of caffeine ( Vivarin ) .
Background	Participants then rested for @ minutes , and performed a @-minute computerized air traffic controller-like task that was cognitively engaging but not stressful .
Background	Saliva samples ( assayed for sAA and cortisol ) , blood pressure , and heart rate were taken before ( baseline ) and @ minutes after the computerized task .
Result	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sAA activity increased across the laboratory session ( F 's > @ , p 's < @ ) ; salivary cortisol levels decreased ( F = @ , p < @ ) .
Result	There were no main effects for caffeine administration on sAA , salivary cortisol , or cardiovascular measures , and caffeine did not interact with the task to alter these measures .
Conclusion	Laboratory administered caffeine does not alter sAA activity , even when sAA activity is stimulated by participating in a cognitively engaging task .
Conclusion	These data demonstrate that caffeine administration does not affect sAA activity , at least in healthy young men who regularly consume caffeine .
Conclusion	Results support recent findings that basal caffeine levels in habitual caffeine users are not associated with basal sAA activity and that daily caffeine intake and diurnal sAA activity are not related .

Problem	To evaluate whether administration of analgesic medication one hour before undergoing office hysteroscopy decreased pain and other side effects .
Method	A prospective randomized study was carried out in @ patients who underwent office hysteroscopy from November @ until May @ patients received @mg paracetamol and @mg ibuprofen one hour before the procedure and @ did not receive any medication .
Result	We observed significant differences ( p = @ ) regarding the occurrence of non-pain side effects , @ % in the non-medicated group and none of the patients in the medicated group .
Result	The main pain score was always slightly higher in the group receiving no medication , though there was no statistically significant difference when compared to the medicated group .
Conclusion	Administration of @g paracetamol and @mg ibuprofen one hour prior to office hysteroscopy decreased statistically the occurrence of non-pain side effects such as nausea , emesis , and hypotension .
Conclusion	No differences in pain scores were observed .

Problem	Prior research has indicated that the loss of skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density observed with aging is related to the prominent age-related decline in the concentration of serum growth hormone ( GH ) .
Problem	However , there is limited data on the effects of aging on GH responses to acute bouts of heavy resistance exercise ( HRE ) and aerobic exercise ( AE ) .
Method	The present investigation examined the effects of a HRE protocol and an AE protocol on immunoreactive GH ( IGH ) and bioactive GH ( BGH ) in active young and old women .
Result	Older women had a diminished serum IGH response to both the HRE and AE protocols compared to the younger women , however a similar response was not observed in serum BGH .
Result	Additionally , the HRE protocol elicited a greater BGH response than the AE protocol exclusively in the younger group .
Conclusion	Regardless of exercise mode , aging induces an increase in growth hormone polymerization that specifically results in a loss of serum growth hormone immunoreactivity without a concurrent loss of serum growth hormone bioactivity .
Conclusion	The greater BGH response to the HRE protocol found in the younger group can be attributed to an unknown serum factor of molecular weight between @ and @kD that either potentiated growth hormone bioactivity in response to HRE or inhibited growth hormone bioactivity in response to AE .

Background	Elderly patients are at high risk for both ischemic and bleeding events .
Background	Platelet monitoring offers the opportunity to individualized antiplatelet therapy to optimize the therapeutic risk/benefit ratio .
Method	The ANTARCTIC study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of a strategy of platelet function monitoring with dose and drug adjustment in patients initially on prasugrel @ mg as compared with a more conventional strategy using prasugrel @ mg without monitoring and without adjustment ( Conventional Treatment Arm ) to reduce the primary end point evaluated @ year after stent percutaneous coronary intervention in elderly patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) .
Method	ANTARCTIC is a multicenter , prospective , open-label study with @ parallel arms .
Method	A total of @ elderly patients ( @ years ) undergoing stent percutaneous coronary intervention for ACS are to be enrolled .
Method	The primary end point is the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , stroke , definite stent thrombosis , urgent revascularization , and bleeding complications ( Bleeding Academic Research Consortium definition @ , @ , or @ ) .
Method	Platelet function analyses will be performed @ days after randomization and repeated @ days later in patients who require a change in treatment .
Conclusion	ANTARCTIC is a nationwide , prospective , open-label study testing a strategy of platelet function monitoring with dose and drug adjustment to reduce ischemic and bleeding complications in elderly ACS patients undergoing coronary stenting .

Problem	To identify facilitators and barriers to clinical trial implementation in Aboriginal health services .
Method	Indepth interview study with thematic analysis .
Method	Six Aboriginal community-controlled health services and one government-run service involved in the Kanyini Guidelines Adherence with the Polypill ( KGAP ) study , a pragmatic randomised controlled trial that aimed to improve adherence to indicated drug treatments for people at high risk of cardiovascular disease .
Method	@ health care providers and @ Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients .
Result	A fundamental enabler was that participants considered the research to be governed and endorsed by the local health service .
Result	That the research was perceived to address a health priority for communities was also highly motivating for both providers and patients .
Result	Enlisting the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff champions who were visible to the community as the main source of information about the trial was particularly important .
Result	The major implementation barrier for staff was balancing their service delivery roles with adherence to often highly demanding trial-related procedures .
Result	This was partially alleviated by the research team 's provision of onsite support and attempts to make trial processes more streamlined .
Result	Although more intensive support was highly desired , there were usually insufficient resources to provide this .
Conclusion	Despite strong community and health service support , major investments in time and resources are needed to ensure successful implementation and minimal disruption to already overstretched , routine services .
Conclusion	Trial budgets will necessarily be inflated as a result .
Conclusion	Funding agencies need to consider these additional resource demands when supporting trials of a similar nature .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether individualized deliberate practice on a virtual reality ( VR ) simulator results in improved technical performance in the operating room .
Background	Training on VR simulators has been shown to improve technical performance in the operating room ( OR ) .
Background	Currently described VR curricula consist of trainees practicing the same tasks until expert proficiency is reached .
Background	It has yet to be investigated whether the individualized deliberate practice , where curricula tasks vary depending on prior levels of technical proficiency , would translate into the OR .
Method	This single-blinded prospective trial randomized @ novice surgical residents to a deliberate practice ( DP ) group and a conventional residency training group .
Method	Both groups performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the OR that was video-recorded .
Method	Technical performance of DP group residents in the OR was assessed using @ validated assessment tools .
Method	A score of less than @ % on any component of the assessment tool resulted in the trainee practicing a specific task on the VR simulator .
Method	The DP group practiced on the simulator as per their individualized schedule .
Method	Both groups then performed another laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
Method	A blinded expert assessed the OR recordings using a validated global rating scale .
Result	Although both groups had similar technical abilities preintervention -LSB- DP : median score , @ ( @-@ @ ) ; control : median score , @ ( @-@ @ ) ; P = @ -RSB- , the DP residents had a superior technical performance postintervention -LSB- DP : median score , @ ( @-@ @ ) ; control : median score , @ ( @-@ @ ) ; P = @ -RSB- .
Result	Of @ DP residents , @ practiced @ basic VR tasks ( median @ trial to pass ) , and @ of @ practiced @ advanced tasks ( median @ trials to pass ) .
Conclusion	A curriculum of deliberate individualized practice on a VR simulator improves technical performance in the OR .
Conclusion	This has implications to greatly improve the feasibility of implementing simulation-based curricula in residency training programs , rather then having them being limited to research protocols .

Conclusion	TST for severe prolapsing hemorrhoids is a satisfactory technique for more rapid recovery , lower complication rates , and higher operation security .

Background	Foods that enhance satiety can help consumers to resist environmental cues to eat , and improve the nutritional quality of their diets .
Background	Viscosity generated by oat - glucan , influences gastrointestinal mechanisms that mediate satiety .
Background	Differences in the source , processing treatments , and interactions with other constituents in the food matrix affect the amount , solubility , molecular weight , and structure of the - glucan in products , which in turn influences the viscosity .
Background	This study examined the effect of two types of oatmeal and an oat-based ready-to-eat breakfast cereal ( RTEC ) on appetite , and assessed differences in meal viscosity and - glucan characteristics among the cereals .
Method	Forty-eight individuals were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial .
Method	Subjects consumed isocaloric breakfast meals containing instant oatmeal ( IO ) , old-fashioned oatmeal ( SO ) or RTEC in random order at least a week apart .
Method	Each breakfast meal contained @kcal ( @kcal cereal , and @kcal milk ) Visual analogue scales measuring appetite were completed before breakfast , and over four hours , following the meal .
Method	Starch digestion kinetics , meal viscosities , and - glucan characteristics for each meal were determined .
Method	Appetite responses were analyzed by area under the curve .
Method	Mixed models were used to analyze response changes over time .
Result	IO increased fullness ( p = @ ) , suppressed desire to eat ( p = @ ) and reduced prospective intake ( p < @ ) more than the RTEC over four hours , and consistently at the @minute time-point .
Result	SO reduced prospective intake ( p = @ ) more than the RTEC .
Result	Hunger scores were not significantly different except that IO reduced hunger more than the RTEC at the @minute time-point .
Result	IO and SO had higher - glucan content , molecular weight , gastric viscosity , and larger hydration spheres than the RTEC , and IO had greater viscosity after oral and initial gastric digestion ( initial viscosity ) than the RTEC .
Conclusion	IO and SO improved appetite control over four hours compared to RTEC .
Conclusion	Initial viscosity of oatmeal may be especially important for reducing appetite .

Conclusion	The Intralase iFS @-kHz femtosecond laser creates flaps of similar thickness and uniformity to the Intralase FS @-kHz femtosecond laser .

Problem	Probiotics help maintain balance in composition of the gut microbiota , and have been considered as a potential treatment for obesity .
Problem	This study was conducted in order to assess the effects of probiotics when combined with herbal medicine in treatment of obesity .
Problem	Probiotics were tested for the ability to modulate gut microbiota , gut permeability , and endotoxin level , which may have correlation with factors involved in obesity .
Method	A randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled study was conducted , in which patients with higher BMI ( > @kg/m ( @ ) ) and waist circumference ( > @cm ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive Bofutsushosan with either probiotics or placebo capsules for a period of eight weeks .
Method	Assessment of body composition parameters , metabolic biomarkers , endotoxin level , gut permeability , and fecal bacteria in stool was performed at baseline and at week @ .
Method	The study was registered at the Clinical Research Information Service , approved by the Korea National Institute of Health ( KCT@ ) .
Result	Although both groups showed a significant reduction in weight and waist circumference ( p = @ ) , no significant differences in body composition and metabolic markers were observed .
Result	In correlation analysis , change in body composition showed positive correlation with endotoxin level ( r = @ , p < @ for BW ; and r = @ , p < @ for fat mass ) and the population of gut Lactobacillus plantarum ( r = @ , p < @ for BW ; and r = @ , p < @ for BMI ) .
Result	The Gram negative bacterial population in gut also exhibited positive correlation with changes in body composition ( WC ) and total cholesterol level ( r = @ , and @ , for the former and later parameters , respectively , p < @ for both ) .
Result	While , the profile of gut Bifidobacterium breve population showed negative correlation with endotoxin level ( r = -@ , p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Correlations between gut microbiota and change in body composition indicate that probiotics may influence energy metabolism in obesity .
Conclusion	Correlation between endotoxin level and weight reduction indicates that probiotics may play an important role in prevention of endotoxin production , which can lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis associated with obesity .

Background	Early prognostication after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation is difficult , and there is a need for novel methods to estimate the extent of brain injury and predict outcome .
Background	In this study , we evaluated the impact of the cardiac arrest syndrome on the plasma levels of selected tissue-specific microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and assessed their ability to prognosticate death and neurological disability .
Method	We included @ patients treated with hypothermia after cardiac arrest in the study .
Method	Blood samples were obtained at @ hours and at @ hours .
Method	For miRNA-screening purposes , custom quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) panels were first used .
Method	Thereafter individual miRNAs were assessed at @ hours with qPCR .
Method	miRNAs that successfully predicted prognosis at @ hours were further analysed at @ hours .
Method	Outcomes were measured according to the Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) score at @ months after cardiac arrest and stratified into good ( CPC score @ or @ ) or poor ( CPC scores @ to @ ) .
Result	At @ hours , miR-@a , miR-@ , miR-@b , miR-@ , miR-@ and miR-@ did not differ between the good and poor neurological outcome groups .
Result	In contrast , miR-@ was significantly elevated in patients with poor outcomes compared with those with favourable outcomes ( P < @ ) at @ hours and @ hours after cardiac arrest .
Result	Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves at @ and @ hours after cardiac arrest showed areas under the curve of @ ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @ to @ ) and @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ ) , respectively .
Conclusion	The brain-enriched miRNA miR-@ is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological prognosis following cardiac arrest .

Problem	Secondary acute myeloid leukemia ( sAML ) , defined as AML arising after a prior myelodysplastic syndrome or after antineoplastic therapy , responds poorly to current therapies .
Problem	It is often associated with adverse karyotypic abnormalities and overexpression of proteins that mediate drug resistance .
Problem	We performed a phase III trial to determine whether induction therapy with cytarabine and amonafide L-malate , a DNA intercalator and non-ATP-dependent topoisomerase II inhibitor that evades drug resistance mechanisms , yielded a superior complete remission rate than standard therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin in sAML .
Method	Patients with previously untreated sAML were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cytarabine @ mg/m ( @ ) continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion once per day on days @ to @ plus either amonafide @ mg/m ( @ ) IV over @ hours on days @ to @ ( A + C arm ) or daunorubicin @ mg/m ( @ ) IV over @ minutes once per day on days @ to @ ( D + C arm ) .
Result	The complete remission ( CR ) rate was @ % ( @ of @ patients ) in A + C arm and @ % ( @ of @ patients ) in D + C arm ( P = @ ) .
Result	The @ - and @-day mortality rates were @ % and @ % in A + C arm and @ % and @ % in D + C arm , respectively .
Conclusion	Induction treatment with A + C did not improve the CR rate compared with D + C in patients with sAML .

Background	Few studies have evaluated the possible beneficial effect of the administration of stem cells in the early stages of stroke .
Background	Intravenous administration of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) from adipose tissue in patients with acute stroke could be a safe therapy for promoting neurovascular unit repair , consequently supporting better functional recovery .
Background	We aim to assess the safety and efficacy of MSC administration and evaluate its potential as a treatment for cerebral protection and repair .
Method	A Phase IIa , prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-center , pilot clinical trial .
Method	Twenty patients presenting acute ischemic stroke will be randomized in a @:@ proportion to treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue or to placebo ( or vehicle ) administered as a single intravenous dose within the first @ weeks after the onset of stroke symptoms .
Method	The patients will be followed up for @ years .
Method	Primary outcomes for safety analysis : adverse events ( AEs ) and serious AEs ; neurologic and systemic complications , and tumor development .
Method	Secondary outcomes for efficacy analysis : modified Rankin Scale ; NIHSS ; infarct size ; and biochemical markers of brain repair ( vascular endothelial growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , and matrix metalloproteinases @ ) .
Conclusion	To our knowledge , this is the first , phase II , pilot clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue within the first @ weeks of stroke .
Conclusion	In addition , its results will help us define the best criteria for a future phase III study .

Background	We sought to determine if outcomes with exercise training in heart failure ( HF ) vary according to ventricular pacing type .
Result	Heart Failure : A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training ( HF-ACTION ) randomized @,@ outpatients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction @ % to usual care plus exercise training or usual care alone .
Result	We examined the relationship between outcomes and randomized treatment according to ventricular pacing status with the use of Cox proportional hazards modeling .
Result	In HF-ACTION @,@ patients ( @ % ) had an implanted cardiac rhythm device : @ with right ventricular ( RV ) and @ with biventricular ( BiV ) pacemakers .
Result	Patients with pacing devices were older , more frequently white , and had lower peak VO@ ( P < @ for all ) .
Result	Peak VO@ improved similarly with training in groups with and without pacing devices .
Result	The primary composite end point-all-cause death or hospitalization-was reduced only in patients randomized to exercise training without a device ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ; RV lead : HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ; BiV pacing : HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ -LSB- P = @ -RSB- ; interaction P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Exercise training may improve exercise capacity in patients with implanted cardiac devices .
Conclusion	However , the apparent beneficial effects of exercise on hospitalization or death may be attenuated in patients with implanted cardiac devices and requires further study .

Background	A restricted sympathetic block during spinal anesthesia may minimize hemodynamic changes .
Background	This prospective randomized study compared unilateral and bilateral spinal anesthesia with respect to the intra - and postoperative advantages and complications of each technique .
Method	Spinal anesthesia was induced with @ % hyperbaric bupivacaine and a @-G Quincke needle ( Dr. J ) in two groups of patients with physical status ASA I-II who had been admitted for orthopedic surgeries .
Method	In group A , dural puncture was performed with the patient in a seated position using @ cm ( @ ) of hyperbaric bupivacaine .
Method	Each patient was then placed in the supine position .
Method	In group B , dural puncture was performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position with @ cm ( @ ) of hyperbaric bupivacaine .
Method	The lower limb was the target limb .
Method	The speed of injection was @ mL/@s , and the duration of time spent in the lateral decubitus position was @ min .
Result	The demographic data were similar in both groups .
Result	The time to the onset of the sensory and motor block was significantly shorter in group A ( p = @ ) .
Result	The duration of motor and sensory block was shorter in group B ( p < @ ) .
Result	The success rate for unilateral spinal anesthesia in group B was @ % .
Result	In two patients , the spinal block spread to the non-dependent side .
Result	The incidence of complications ( nausea , headache , and hypotension ) was lower in group B ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	When unilateral spinal anesthesia was performed using a low-dose , low-volume and low-flow injection technique , it provides adequate sensory-motor block and helps to achieve stable hemodynamic parameters during orthopedic surgery on a lower limb .
Conclusion	Patients were more satisfied with this technique as opposed to the conventional approach .
Conclusion	Furthermore , this technique avoids unnecessary paralysis on the non-operated side .

Background	Postoperative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) is considered to be a transient arrhythmia in the first week after cardiac surgery .
Problem	To determine the @-day incidence and predictors of POAF and the value of postoperative overdrive biatrial pacing in the prevention of POAF .
Method	Patients ( n = @ ) without a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) were randomized into a pacing group ( n = @ ) and a control group .
Method	Patients were treated with standardized sotalol postoperatively .
Method	Rhythm was continuously monitored for @ days by a transtelephonic event recorder .
Result	POAF occurred in @ ( @ % ) patients , of whom @ ( @ % ) patients showed POAF during postoperative days ( PODs ) @-@ and @ ( @ % ) patients during PODs @-@ .
Result	Prolonged aortic cross-clamp time was an important univariate predictor of @-day and of late POAF ( PODs @-@ ; P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
Result	Best-fit model analysis using @ predetermined risk factors for POAF showed different positive interactive effects for early POAF ( ie , baseline C-reactive protein levels with a history of myocardial infarction or low body mass index ) and late POAF ( ie , high body mass index , diabetes mellitus , baseline C-reactive protein , early POAF , creatinine levels , type of operation , smoking , and male gender ) .
Result	Biatrial pacing reduced the late POAF incidence in patients with aortic cross-clamp time > @ minutes ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	POAF is not limited to the first week after cardiac surgery but also occurs frequently in the postoperative month .
Conclusion	It is desirable to regularly follow patients with POAF for atrial fibrillation recurrences after discharge .

Background	The measurement of mechanosensitivity is a key method for the study of pain in animal models .
Background	This is often accomplished with the use of von Frey filaments in an up-down testing paradigm .
Background	The up-down method described by Chaplan et al. ( J Neurosci Methods @:@ -@ , @ ) for mechanosensitivity testing in rodents remains one of the most widely used methods for measuring pain in animals .
Background	However , this method results in animals receiving a varying number of stimuli , which may lead to animals in different groups receiving different testing experiences that influences their later responses .
Background	To standardize the measurement of mechanosensitivity we developed a simplified up-down method ( SUDO ) for estimating paw withdrawal threshold ( PWT ) with von Frey filaments that uses a constant number of five stimuli per test .
Background	We further refined the PWT calculation to allow the estimation of PWT directly from the behavioral response to the fifth stimulus , omitting the need for look-up tables .
Result	The PWT estimates derived using SUDO strongly correlated ( r > @ ) with the PWT estimates determined with the conventional up-down method of Chaplan et al. , and this correlation remained very strong across different levels of tester experience , different experimental conditions , and in tests from both mice and rats .
Result	The two testing methods also produced similar PWT estimates in prospective behavioral tests of mice at baseline and after induction of hyperalgesia by intraplantar capsaicin or complete Freund 's adjuvant .
Conclusion	SUDO thus offers an accurate , fast and user-friendly replacement for the widely used up-down method of Chaplan et al. .

Problem	Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ; aspirin ) for secondary prevention reduces cardiovascular disease mortality risk .
Problem	ASA acetylates cyclooxygenase in the portal circulation and is rapidly ( half-life , @ min ) hydrolyzed .
Problem	Certain patients with cardiovascular disease may exhibit high on-therapy platelet reactivity as a result of high platelet turnover , a process whereby platelets are produced and are active beyond the duration of antiplatelet coverage provided by once-daily immediate-release ( IR ) ASA .
Problem	A once-daily , extended-release ( ER ) ASA formulation using ER microcapsule technology was developed to release ASA over the @-h dosing interval and reduce maximal plasma concentrations to spare peripheral endogenous endothelial prostacyclin production .
Method	Healthy adults ( n = @ ) were randomized in a crossover study to receive two different ER-ASA single doses ( up to @ mg ) and two different IR-ASA single doses ( up to @ mg ) in four periods , each separated by @ days .
Method	Pharmacodynamics was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B@ ( TXB@ ) , urine @-dehydro-TXB@ , and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation .
Method	Pharmacokinetics was determined for ASA and salicylic acid ( SA ) .
Result	Both formulations produced dose-dependent inhibition on all pharmacodynamic parameters .
Result	Marked inhibition of TXB@ and @-dehydro-TXB@ was maintained over the @-h dosing interval after a dose of @ mg ER-ASA or @ mg IR-ASA .
Result	The dose required to achieve @ % of maximum TXB@ inhibition with ER-ASA was @ mg versus @ mg for IR-ASA , for a similar maximum pharmacodynamic effect ( @ % TXB@ inhibition ) .
Result	This suggests that an approximately twofold greater ER-ASA dose ( @ mg ) is necessary to obtain the same response as that of IR-ASA @ mg .
Result	Peak ASA concentrations were lower and Tmax was longer with ER-ASA versus IR-ASA .
Result	Administration of IR-ASA resulted in a dose-normalized mean Cmax of ASA that was approximately sixfold higher than that for ER-ASA and a Cmax of SA approximately two - to threefold higher than that for ER-ASA .
Conclusion	Both ASA formulations showed dose-dependent antiplatelet activity .
Conclusion	Compared with the IR-ASA , ER-ASA released active drug more slowly , resulting in prolonged absorption and lower systemic drug concentrations , which is expected for an ER ( @-h ) formulation .

Background	Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER@ signalling than trastuzumab alone .
Background	Therefore , we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer ( aGC ) .
Method	Patients received pertuzumab @ mg for cycle @ and @ mg q@w for cycles @-@ ( Arm A ) or pertuzumab @ mg q@w for six cycles ( Arm B ) .
Method	Trastuzumab , cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles , then trastuzumab q@w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity .
Method	The co-primary endpoints were day @ pertuzumab serum trough concentration ( Cmin ) and safety .
Result	Thirty patients were randomised .
Result	Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day @ was @ g ml ( -@ ) ( s.d. : @ ) in Arm A and @ g ml ( -@ ) ( @ ) in Arm B. Mean day @ Cmin in Arm A was ~ @ % lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer .
Result	The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated .
Result	Partial responses were achieved by @ % and @ % of patients in Arms A and B , respectively .
Conclusion	On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data , the @ mg q@w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab , trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER@-positive aGC .

Problem	To determine the frequency of pharmacogenomic variants and concurrent medications that may alter the efficacy and tolerability of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs ) .
Method	A multisite cross-sectional study was carried out across four memory care practices in the greater Indianapolis area .
Method	Participants were adults aged @ years and older with a diagnosis of probable or possible Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( n = @ ) .
Method	Blood samples and self-reported medication data were collected .
Method	Since two of the three AChEIs are metabolized by cytochrome P@ ( CYP ) -@ D@ , we determined the frequency of functional genetic variants in the CYP@D@ gene and calculated their predicted CYP@D@-activity scores .
Method	Concurrent medication data were collected from self-reported medication surveys , and their predicted effect on the pharmacokinetics of AChEIs was determined based on their known effects on CYP@D@ and CYP@A@/@ enzyme activities .
Result	Among the @ subjects enrolled , @ % were female and @ % were African American .
Result	Subjects had a mean age of @ years .
Result	The population used a mean of eight medications per day ( prescription and nonprescription ) .
Result	The CYP@D@ activity score frequencies were @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @-@ @ ( @ % ) , and > @ ( @ % ) .
Result	Nineteen subjects ( @ % ) used a medication considered a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP@D@ , and eight subjects ( @ % ) used a medication considered a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP@A@/@ .
Result	In total , @ % of the study population was predicted to have reduced activity of the CYP@D@ or CYP@A@/@ enzymes due to either genetic variants or concomitant medications .
Conclusion	Both pharmacogenetic variants and concurrent drug therapies that are predicted to alter the pharmacokinetics of AChEIs should be evaluated in older adults with AD .
Conclusion	Pharmacogenetic and drug-interaction data may help personalize AD therapy and increase adherence by improving tolerability .

Background	Due to fragmented mental , somatic , and social healthcare services , it can be hard to engage into care older patients with severe mental illness ( SMI ) .
Background	In adult mental health care , assertive community treatment ( ACT ) is an organizational model of care for treating patients with SMI who are difficult to engage .
Background	So far all outcome studies of assertive community treatment have been conducted in adults .
Method	In a randomized controlled trial design we compared the effectiveness of ACT for elderly patients with that of treatment as usual ( TAU ) .
Method	Sixty-two outpatients ( @ years and older ) with SMI who were difficult to engage in psychiatric treatment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group ( @ to ACT for elderly patients and @ to TAU ) .
Method	Primary outcomes included number of patients who had a first treatment contact within @ months , the number of dropouts ( i.e. those discharged from care due to refusing care or those who unintentionally lost contact with the service over a period of at least @ months ) ; and patients ' psychosocial functioning ( HoNOS@ + scores ) during @ months follow-up .
Method	Secondary outcomes included the number of unmet needs and mental health care use .
Method	Analyses were based on intention-to-treat .
Result	Of the @ patients who were randomized , @ were lost to follow-up ( @ patients in ACT for elderly patients and @ in TAU ) .
Result	Relative to patients with TAU , more patients allocated to ACT had a first contact within three months ( @ versus @ % ; X@ ( df = @ ) = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	ACT for elderly patients also had fewer dropouts from treatment ( @ % of assertive community treatment for elderly patients versus @ % of TAU patients ; X@ ( df = @ ) = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	There were no differences in the other primary and secondary outcome variables .
Conclusion	These findings suggest that ACT for elderly patients with SMI engaged patients in treatment more successfully .

Background	In this study we tested the hypothesis that tirasemtiv , a selective fast skeletal muscle troponin activator that sensitizes the sarcomere to calcium , could amplify the response of muscle to neuromuscular input in humans .
Method	Healthy men received tirasemtiv and placebo in a randomized , double-blind , @-period , crossover design .
Method	The deep fibular nerve was stimulated transcutaneously to activate the tibialis anterior muscle and produce dorsiflexion of the foot .
Method	The force-frequency relationship of tibialis anterior dorsiflexion was assessed after dosing .
Result	Tirasemtiv increased force produced by the tibialis anterior in a dose - , concentration - , and frequency-dependent manner with the largest increases -LSB- up to @ % ( SE @ ) , P < @ -RSB- produced at subtetanic nerve stimulation frequencies ( @ Hz ) .
Conclusion	The data confirm that tirasemtiv amplifies the response of skeletal muscle to nerve input in humans .
Conclusion	This outcome provides support for further studies of tirasemtiv as a potential therapy in conditions marked by diminished neuromuscular input .

Background	Motives for use have been identified as important predictors of substance use and related problems ; however , little is known about how motives for use change following an intervention and how this change may impact future substance use behaviors .
Background	The present study sought to describe change in motives following an intervention for marijuana-dependent adults .
Background	Furthermore , investigators examined change in motives as a predictor of treatment outcome .
Method	The study randomized @ adults to one of two conditions : both of which received @-sessions base treatment of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy and had access to additional sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment on an as-needed basis .
Method	The experimental condition received two additional `` check-ups '' during the course of follow-up .
Result	Significant decreases in reported frequency of motives used were observed following treatment .
Result	Changes in Expansion and Coping were associated with differential treatment outcomes .
Result	Decreases in Expansion were associated with poorer treatment outcome , while decreases in Coping were associated with better treatment outcome .
Conclusion	The relationship between expansion motives and outcomes was paradoxical .
Conclusion	Although there were some inconsistencies in the findings , the results regarding the coping motive were consistent with hypotheses and may have important implications for treatment .

Background	Although asthma is characterized by variable airways obstruction , most studies of asthma phenotypes are cross-sectional .
Background	The stability of phenotypes defined either by biomarkers or by physiological variables was assessed by repeated measures over @year in the Pan-European BIOAIR cohort of adult asthmatics .
Method	A total of @ patients , @ with severe asthma ( SA ) and @ with mild-to-moderate asthma ( MA ) , were examined at six or more visits during @year .
Method	Asthma phenotype clusters were defined by physiological variables ( lung function , reversibility and age of onset of the disease ) or by biomarkers ( eosinophils and neutrophils in induced sputum ) .
Result	After @year of follow-up , the allocation to clusters was changed in @ % of all asthma patients when defined by physiological phenotypes and , remarkably , in @ % of the patients when stratified according to sputum cellularity ( P = @ ) .
Result	In the SA cohort , @ % and @ % of the patients changed allocation according to physiological and biomarker clustering , respectively .
Result	Variability of phenotypes was not influenced by change in oral or inhaled corticosteroid dose , nor by the number of exacerbations .
Result	Lower stability of single and repeated measure was found for all evaluated biomarkers ( eosinophils , neutrophils and FeNO ) in contrast to good stability of physiological variables ( FEV@ ) , quality of life and asthma control .
Conclusion	Phenotypes determined by biomarkers are less stable than those defined by physiological variables , especially in severe asthmatics .
Conclusion	The data also imply that definition of asthma phenotypes is improved by repeated measures to account for fluctuations in lung function , biomarkers and asthma control .

Background	Poverty undermines the adherence of patients to tuberculosis treatment .
Background	A pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the extent to which economic support in the form of a voucher would improve patients ' adherence to treatment , and their treatment outcomes .
Background	Although the trial showed a modest improvement in the treatment success rates of the intervention group , this was not statistically significant , due in part to the low fidelity to the trial intervention .
Background	A qualitative process evaluation , conducted in the final few months of the trial , explained some of the factors that contributed to this low fidelity .
Method	In-depth interviews were conducted with patients who received vouchers , nurses in intervention clinics , personnel in shops who administered the vouchers , and managers of the TB Control Programme .
Method	These interviews were analyzed thematically .
Result	The low fidelity to the trial intervention can be explained by two main factors .
Result	The first was nurses ' tendency to ` ration ' the vouchers , only giving them to the most needy of eligible patients and leaving out those eligible patients whom they felt were financially more comfortable .
Result	The second was logistical issues related to the administration of the voucher as vouchers were not always available for patients on their appointed clinic dates , necessitating further visits to the clinics which they were not always able to make .
Conclusion	This process evaluation identifies some of the most important factors that contributed to the results of this pragmatic trial .
Conclusion	It highlights the value of process evaluations as tools to explain the results of randomized trials and emphasizes the importance of implementers as ` street level bureaucrats ' who may profoundly affect the way an intervention is administered .

Background	This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a granule formulation of dolutegravir developed as an alternative to tablets for use in paediatric populations .
Method	A randomized , open-label study in healthy adults was carried out .
Method	Subjects received five treatments in a crossover design : a single dose of dolutegravir @ mg as a tablet and dolutegravir @ mg in @ g of granule administered directly to mouth or mixed with purified water , water containing high cation concentrations or milk-based infant formula .
Method	Study treatments were separated by @ days .
Method	Safety evaluations and serial pharmacokinetic sampling were done during each treatment period .
Method	A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed ; geometric least-squares mean ratios and @ % CIs were generated for treatment comparison .
Method	Palatability was assessed by questionnaire .
Result	Plasma dolutegravir exposures in all granule treatment arms exceeded those of tablet formulation .
Result	The mean area under the curve from time @ to infinity ( AUC ( @ - ) ) and maximum concentrations were @-@ % and @-@ % higher , respectively .
Result	Pharmacokinetics were similar when dolutegravir was mixed with purified or cation-containing water .
Result	Dolutegravir was well tolerated , with no withdrawals due to adverse events .
Result	Taste was rated acceptable for all treatments .
Conclusion	The exposure of dolutegravir after administration of granule formulation alone , with different types of water and with milk formula , exceeded that of the tablet .
Conclusion	The similarity of dolutegravir exposure seen with the granule formulation demonstrates that dolutegravir granule can be given without restriction on the type of liquid or can be administered directly to the mouth ( for example , when potable water is not available ) .

Background	Mother-to-child transmission of HIV remains an important public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa .
Background	As HIV testing and linkage to PMTCT occurs in antenatal care ( ANC ) , major challenges for any PMTCT option in developing countries , including Tanzania , are delays in the first ANC visit and a low overall number of visits .
Background	Community health workers ( CHWs ) have been effective in various settings in increasing the uptake of clinical services and improving treatment retention and adherence .
Background	At the beginning of this trial in January @ , the World Health Organization recommended either of two medication regimens , Option A or B , for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV ( PMTCT ) .
Background	It is still largely unclear which option is more effective when implemented in a public healthcare system .
Background	This study aims to determine the effectiveness , cost-effectiveness , acceptability , and feasibility of : ( @ ) a community health worker ( CWH ) intervention and ( @ ) PMTCT Option B in improving ANC and PMTCT outcomes .
Method	This study is a cluster-randomized controlled health systems implementation trial with a two-by-two factorial design .
Method	All @ administrative wards in the Kinondoni and Ilala districts in Dar es Salaam were first randomly allocated to either receiving the CHW intervention or not , and then to receiving either Option B or A. Under the standard of care , facility-based health workers follow up on patients who have missed scheduled appointments for PMTCT , first through a telephone call and then with a home visit .
Method	In the wards receiving the CHW intervention , the CHWs : ( @ ) identify pregnant women through home visits and refer them to antenatal care ; ( @ ) provide education to pregnant women on antenatal care , PMTCT , birth , and postnatal care ; ( @ ) routinely follow up on all pregnant women to ascertain whether they have attended ANC ; and ( @ ) follow up on women who have missed ANC or PMTCT appointments .

Background	Relations between fibroblast growth factor-@ ( FGF-@ ) , soluble - klotho ( s -- klotho ) , and kidney function in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) are still unclear .
Background	Especially the role of s -- klotho requires further study .
Problem	Our objectives were to analyze the relation of s -- klotho to estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , FGF-@ , and other parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism and to investigate the response of s -- klotho to cholecalciferol .
Method	Twenty-four CKD ( stage @-@ ) patients participated in this @-week randomized controlled trial ( vitamin D and chronic renal insufficiency ) .
Method	Interventions included @ @ IU cholecalciferol or placebo weekly .
Method	S -- klotho was determined by ELISA with antihuman klotho antibodies @G@ and @F@ .
Result	For all patients , s -- klotho concentrations did not differ between CKD stages .
Result	When patients were subdivided based on FGF-@ concentrations , a positive association of s -- klotho with eGFR became apparent in patients with lower than median FGF-@ concentrations but not in those above median value .
Result	Patients with s -- klotho below @ pg/mL showed higher age , lower phosphate clearance , and lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase compared with patients with higher s -- klotho .
Result	Treatment with cholecalciferol significantly increased @,@-dihydroxyvitamin D.
Result	The increase of FGF-@ had only borderline significance .
Result	There was no significant effect of high-dose cholecalciferol administration for @ weeks on plasma s -- klotho .
Conclusion	CKD patients with s -- klotho below @ pg/mL had higher age , lower phosphate clearance , and lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase .
Conclusion	An association of s -- klotho with eGFR was observed only in the presence of close to normal , but not high , FGF-@ concentrations .
Conclusion	Cholecalciferol treatment did not change s -- klotho concentrations .

Problem	Artificial ulcers remain a major complication after Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) .
Problem	The development of more effective treatment regimen for this ulcer is required than the use of proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) alone .
Method	Patients with ESD-derived artificial ulcers were randomly assigned to two groups : a group of patients who received rabeprazole @ mg daily for @ weeks ( PPI group ) and a group of patients who received a combination of rebamipide @ mg daily for @ weeks and rabeprazole @ mg dairy for the first @ weeks ( reb + PPI group ) .
Method	The area reduction ratio and healing status of ulcers were evaluated endoscopically on postoperative @ , @ and @ days .
Result	The overall ulcer area reduction ratio was higher in the reb + PPI group than in the PPI group , especially at an early stage .
Result	The ratio of progression to the H@ stage in the reb + PPI group was significantly higher than that in the PPI group , especially at an early stage .
Conclusion	Treatment with @ weeks of rebamipide plus the first @ weeks of PPI demonstrated a reduction ratio of artificial ulcers superior to that with @ weeks of PPI mono-therapy .
Conclusion	This combination treatment is , therefore , one of the candidate treatment strategies against ESD-derived artificial ulcers .

Problem	To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of oral canagliflozin and its O-glucuronide metabolites ( M@ and M@ ) after single and multiple doses in healthy adult participants .
Problem	The pharmacodynamics , safety , and tolerability of canagliflozin were also evaluated .
Method	In this open-label , single - ( day @ ) and multiple-dose ( days @-@ ) , parallel-group , phase @ study , @ healthy participants were randomized into three groups ( @:@:@ ) to receive @ , @ , or @ mg canagliflozin .
Method	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed at pre-pecified timepoints on days @ , @ , and @ .
Result	Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve , and the maximum observed plasma concentration of canagliflozin , M@ , and M@ increased in a dose-dependent manner , across all the @ doses , following single - and multiple-dose administration .
Result	The mean apparent elimination half-lives of canagliflozin , M@ , and M@ were independent of the dose .
Result	Canagliflozin decreased the renal threshold for glucose ( RTG ) and increased the urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) in a concentration - and dose-dependent manner .
Result	The relationship between drug concentrations and RTG was described by a sigmoidal relationship with RTGmin ( minimum value of RTG ) of @ ng/mL ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ , @ ) and half-maximal effective concentration ( EC@ ) of @ ng/mL ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
Result	No deaths , serious adverse events , hypoglycemic events , or discontinuations due to adverse events were observed .
Conclusion	Pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and its metabolites ( M@ and M@ ) were linear , and no time-dependent changes were observed after single - and multiple-dose administration .
Conclusion	Similarly , pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin on RTG and UGE were found to be dose - and concentration-dependent .
Conclusion	Overall , canagliflozin was well-tolerated in healthy participants .

Problem	The study objectives were to analyze the impact of the number of lymph nodes ( LNs ) reported as resected ( NLNr ) and the number of LNs invaded ( NLNi ) on the prognosis of esophageal cancer ( EC ) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy .
Background	Pathological LN status is a major disease prognostic factor and marker of surgical quality .
Background	The impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiation ( nCRT ) on LN status remains poorly studied in EC .
Method	Post hoc analysis from a phase III randomized controlled trial comparing nCRT and surgery ( group nCRT ) to surgery alone ( group S ) in stage I and II EC ( NCT@ ) .
Method	Only patients who underwent surgical resection were considered ( n = @ ) .
Result	nCRT resulted in tumoral downstaging ( pT@ , @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) , LN downstaging ( pN@ , @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , and reduction in the median NLNr -LSB- @ ( range , @-@ @ ) vs @ ( range , @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- and NLNi -LSB- @ ( range , @-@ ) vs @ ( range , @-@ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	A good histological response ( TRG@/@ ) in the resected esophageal specimen correlated with reduced median NLNi -LSB- @ ( range , @-@ ) vs @ ( range , @-@ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	After adjustment by treatment , NLNi -LSB- hazards ratio ( HR ) ( @-@ vs @ ) @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @-@ @ , and HR ( > @ vs @ ) @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P < @ -RSB- correlated with prognosis , whereas NLNr -LSB- HR ( < @ vs @ ) @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P = @ and HR ( < @ vs @ ) @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P = @ -RSB- did not .
Result	In Poisson regression analysis , nCRT was an independent predictive variable for reduced NLNr -LSB- exp ( coefficient ) @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , P = @ -RSB- .
Conclusion	nCRT is not only responsible for disease downstaging but also predicts fewer LNs being identified after surgical resection for EC .
Conclusion	This has implications for the current quality criteria for surgical resection .

Background	There is a long-held concept among spine surgeons that endoscopic lumbar discectomy procedures are reserved for small-contained disc herniation ; @-year follow-up has not been reported .
Background	The purpose of this study is to assess microendoscopic discectomy ( MED ) in patients with large uncontained lumbar disc herniation ( the antero-posterior diameter of the extruded fragment is @-@ mm or more on axial cuts of MRI ) and report long-term outcome .
Method	One hundred eighty-five patients with MED or standard open discectomy underwent follow-up for @ years .
Method	Primary ( clinical ) outcomes data included Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) for back and leg symptoms and Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) to quantify pain and disability , respectively .
Method	Secondary ( objective ) outcomes data included operative time , blood loss , postoperative analgesics , length of hospital stay , time to return to work , reoperation and complication rate , patient satisfaction index ( PSI ) , and modified ( MacNab ) criteria .
Result	At the end of the follow-up , the leg pain relief was statistically significant for both groups .
Result	NRS back pain , ODI , PSI and MacNab criteria showed significant deterioration for control group .
Result	Secondary outcomes data of MED group were significantly better than the control group .
Conclusion	Large , uncontained , lumbar disc herniations can be sufficiently removed using MED which is an effective alternative to open discectomy procedures with remarkable long-term outcome .
Conclusion	Although the neurological outcome of the two procedures is the same , the morbidity of MED is significantly less than open discectomy .
Conclusion	Maximum benefit can be gained if we adhere to strict selection criteria .
Conclusion	The optimum indication is single - or multi-level radiculopathy secondary to a single-level , large , uncontained , lumbar disc herniation .

Problem	To evaluate the short-term benefits of simple relaxation techniques in white-collar employees .
Method	The study was a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial .
Method	@ employees were randomly assigned to receive the @-week programme ( N = @ ) ( relaxation breathing and progressive muscle relaxation , twice a day ) or not ( wait-list group N = @ ) .
Method	Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress , health locus of control , job and lifestyle related variables .
Method	Saliva cortisol were also sampled and measured .
Method	Adjusted mean changes on outcomes were estimated by linear mixed model analysis .
Method	@ employees were finally analyzed ( @ in the intervention and @ in the control group ) .
Result	Specific stress-related symptoms , psychological job demands and cortisol levels were found to be significantly decreased after @-weeks in the intervention group .
Result	The result was probably affected by the general socio-economic condition during the study period .
Result	Cortisol levels were also significantly related with age , family situation , gender and sampling time .
Conclusion	Simple relaxation training ( diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation ) could benefit employees and it is strongly proposed that these and other similar techniques should be tested in various labour settings .

Background	Gentamicin is used as a therapeutic agent for Mnire 's disease because of its vestibulotoxicity causing chemo-ablation of the vestibular sensory epithelia .
Background	Its use has increased in recent years .
Background	However , there is still no consensus about the dose regimen of gentamicin in the treatment of Mnire 's disease .
Background	In this study two different dose regimen treatment protocols are compared in a placebo controlled study design .
Background	The primary objective is to quantify the treatment effect on dizziness , the secondary objective is hearing evaluation .
Method	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in adults with unilateral Mnire 's disease according to the AAO-HNS guidelines resistant to conservative medication .
Method	Three groups received four injections , administered weekly ( four intratympanic injections with @mg/mL gentamicin solution , two injections gentamicin solution and two injections of placebo in random order , or four injections with placebo ) .
Method	Outcome measures were the score on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and pure tone audiometry ( PTA ) .
Method	Intended follow-up was @years .
Result	During follow-up one patient exceeded the accepted amount of hearing loss .
Result	Further , enrollment was very slow ( until @months between two patients ) and new insights showed an apparent benefit of intratympanic gentamicin treatment ( ITG ) .
Result	Therefore we performed an unscheduled interim analysis which showed that PTA threshold shifts reached the stopping criteria in two more patients .
Result	Because of this , this study was ended .
Result	Of the three patients with the significant PTA threshold shift two were enrolled in the gentamicin group .
Conclusion	No conclusions can be drawn concerning doses regimens .
Conclusion	Now that new publications have shown that ITG treatment can be an effective and safe treatment , a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial may not pass the ethical committee because of these recent reports in literature .
Conclusion	Still , a dose regimen study ( without placebo ) on ITG treatment needs to be performed .

Problem	Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( PPE ) is a common chemotherapy and anti-VEGF multi-kinase inhibitor class-related toxicity that often results in debilitating skin changes and often limits the use of active anti-cancer regimens .
Problem	Mechanistic and anecdotal clinical evidence suggested that topical application of sildenafil cream may help reduce the severity of PPE .
Problem	Therefore , we conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility , safety and efficacy of topical sildenafil cream for the treatment of PPE .
Method	Eligible subjects were required to have grade @-@ PPE associated with either capecitabine or sunitinib .
Method	Subjects were randomized to receive @ % topical sildenafil cream to the left extremities or right extremities and placebo cream on the opposite extremity .
Method	Two times per day , @ mL of cream was applied to each affected hand/foot .
Method	The primary endpoint was improvement in PPE grading at any point on study .
Method	Clinical assessments were evaluated by NCI-CTC @ grading and patient self-reported pain .
Result	Ten subjects were enrolled , nine were evaluable for safety and efficacy .
Result	Five of nine subjects reported some improvement in foot pain and three of eight subjects for hand pain improvement .
Result	One of these subjects noted specific improvement in tactile function .
Result	No treatment-related toxicities were observed .
Conclusion	In this limited , single-center study , topical cream containing @ % sildenafil is feasible to administer , is well-tolerated , and may mitigate PPE-related symptoms due to anti-cancer therapeutic agents .
Conclusion	Further validation is necessary .

Conclusion	Preemptive montelukast can be used safely to reduce the serious pain caused by tonsillectomy in children .

Problem	Mirror therapy ( MT ) has been recommended as a simple , inexpensive approach to treat motor dysfunction .
Problem	The use of a mesh glove ( MG ) was suggested to normalize muscle tone that ameliorates motor impairment .
Problem	Combining two efficient treatment protocols might maximize the benefits from training .
Problem	This study investigated the effects of MT combined with MG ( MG+MT ) versus MT alone on motor performance and daily function after stroke .
Method	Sixteen patients with chronic unilateral stroke were recruited .
Method	A randomized two-group pretest and posttest design was used to randomly assign participants to MG+MT or MT groups .
Method	MT involves repetitive bimanual , symmetrical movement practice in which the individual moves the affected limb as much as she/he could while watching the reflective illusion of the unaffected limb 's movements from a mirror .
Method	The MG+MT group wore a MG on the affected hand during the MT. The Modified Ashworth scale of muscle spasticity ( MAS ) , Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) , Box and Block Test ( BBT ) , and Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) were administered to evaluate spasticity , and motor and daily function .
Result	The results for the BBT ( p = @ ) , total scores ( p = @ ) , grasping subscales ( p = @ ) of ARAT , and FIM transfer scores ( p = @ ) presented significantly large effects in favor of the MG+MT group .
Conclusion	Combining MG with MT significantly improves manual dexterity , grasping , and transfer performance .
Conclusion	Adding the MG component into the MT likely increased the richness of sensory input and improved the movement performance more than MT alone .

Problem	Anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid ( GC ) therapy often induces hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and islet-cell dysfunction .
Problem	Incretin-based therapies may preserve glucose tolerance and pancreatic islet-cell function .
Problem	In this study , we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the dipeptidyl peptidase-@ inhibitor sitagliptin and prednisolone in men at high risk to develop type @ diabetes could protect against the GC-induced diabetogenic effects .
Method	Men with the metabolic syndrome but without diabetes received prednisolone @ mg once daily plus sitagliptin @ mg once daily ( n = @ ) , prednisolone ( n = @ ) or sitagliptin alone ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) for @ days in a double-blind @ @ randomized-controlled study .
Method	Glucose , insulin , C-peptide , and glucagon were measured in the fasted state and following a standardized mixed-meal test .
Method	- cell function parameters were assessed both from a hyperglycemic-arginine clamp procedure and from the meal test .
Method	Insulin sensitivity ( M-value ) was measured by euglycemic clamp .
Result	Prednisolone increased postprandial area under the curve ( AUC ) - glucose by @ % ( P < @ vs placebo ) and postprandial AUC-glucagon by @ % ( P < @ ) .
Result	Prednisolone reduced @st and @nd phase glucose-stimulated - and combined hyperglycemia-arginine-stimulated C-peptide secretion ( all P @ ) .
Result	When sitagliptin was added , both clamp-measured - cell function ( P = NS for @st and @nd phase vs placebo ) and postprandial hyperglucagonemia ( P = NS vs placebo ) remained unaffected .
Result	However , administration of sitagliptin could not prevent prednisolone-induced increment in postprandial glucose concentrations ( P < @ vs placebo ) .
Result	M-value was not altered by any treatment .
Conclusion	Fourteen-day treatment with high-dose prednisolone impaired postprandial glucose metabolism in subjects with the metabolic syndrome .
Conclusion	Concomitant treatment with sitagliptin improved various aspects of pancreatic islet-cell function , but did not prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance by GC treatment .

Background	Drug abuse remains a serious problem in China , and has become a major threat to public health and social security .
Background	Since the issuance and enforcement of the new Anti-Drug law in @ , the community has become the primary site for drug rehabilitation .
Background	However , the attitudes of members in community toward the people with drug use disorders are unclear .
Method	A random sample of household respondents was studied in two communities in Hunan province in China .
Method	A total of @ individuals participated ( response rate @ % ) .
Method	Respondents initially were asked a set of questions about their knowledge about dug dependence , and then were randomly assigned to @ of @ vignette conditions .
Method	Three vignettes described different type of drug dependence meeting diagnostic criteria , and the fourth depicted a `` normal person . ''
Result	Poor knowledge of drug dependence was common .
Result	Negative attitudes towards drug dependent people were widespread .
Result	Most respondents believed that drug dependence was caused by the person 's own weak will ( @ % ) and own hedonistic lifestyle ( @ % ) , and should be punished as illegal behavior ( @ % ) .
Result	The vast majority labeled the person with drug dependence as an addict , rated them as having undesirable characteristics , and expressed a strong desire for social distance .
Result	There were few socio-demographic predictors of both poor knowledge and negative attitudes .
Conclusion	A community-based rehabilitation program in China should take into account the widespread stigmatization of people with drug dependence .

Problem	To study the effects of extensively hydrolyzed protein formula ( eHF ) on the feeding and growth in preterm infants through a multicenter controlled clinical study .
Method	Preterm infants admitted to eight upper first-class hospitals in China between February @ and December @ were randomly selected .
Method	They were divided into two observation groups and two control groups .
Method	The first observation group consisted of preterm infants with a gestational age of < @ weeks , who were fed with eHF for @-@ days after birth and then with standard preterm formula ( SPF ) until discharge .
Method	The second observation group consisted of preterm infants with a gestational age of @-@ weeks , who were fed with SPF after birth , but were switched to eHF ( @-@ days ) if suffering feeding intolerance at @-@ days after birth .
Method	The two control groups with corresponding gestational ages kept to be fed with SPF after birth .
Method	Clinical data were recorded to compare feeding condition , physical growth , blood biochemical indices , and major complications between different groups .
Result	A total of @ preterm infants were enrolled .
Result	Preterm infants with a gestational age of < @ weeks in the observation group had a significantly shorter meconium evacuation time than in the corresponding control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	They also had significantly lower levels of serum total bilirubin at weeks @ and @ after birth compared with the control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	The observation group needed more time in reaching enteral nutrition ( EN ) basic energy uptake of @ kcal / ( kgd ) , partial parenteral nutrition ( PPN ) , hospitalization , and corrected gestational age at discharge compared with the controlled infants ( P < @ ) .
Result	There was no difference in the incidence of extrauterine growth retardation ( EUGR ) at discharge between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
Result	Preterm infants with a gestational age of @-@ weeks in the observation group had significantly lower serum total bilirubin levels at @ weeks after birth compared with the corresponding control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	They required more time in achieving EN basic energy and PPN than in the control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	There was no difference in the incidence of EUGR at discharge between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	For preterm infants , eHF can improve gastrointestinal motility , accelerate bilirubin metabolism and excretion and does not increase the incidence of EUGR .

Background	Modic changes ( MC ) are associated with low back pain ( LBP ) , but effective treatments are lacking .
Background	The aim of this randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial was to evaluate the efficacy of zoledronic acid ( ZA ) for chronic LBP among patients with MC in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
Method	Inclusion criteria were LBP lasting @ months , with an intensity of @ on a @-cm VAS or an Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) of @ % , and MC in MRI .
Method	Patients were randomized into single intravenous infusion of ZA @ mg ( n = @ ) , or placebo ( n = @ ) groups .
Method	The primary outcome was LBP intensity , secondary outcomes leg pain intensity , ODI , health-related quality of life ( RAND-@ ) , lumbar flexibility , sick leaves and use of pain medication .
Method	The treatment differences at one month and one year were analysed using ANCOVA with adjustment for the baseline score .
Result	The mean difference ( MD ) between the groups in the primary outcome , intensity of LBP , was @ ( @ % confidence intervals ( CI ) @ to @ ) in favour of ZA at one month .
Result	We observed no significant between-group difference in the intensity of LBP at one year ( MD @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) or in secondary outcomes at any time point except that @ % of patients in the ZA group used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at one year compared to @ % in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Acute phase reactions ( fever , flu-like symptoms , arthralgia ) emerged in @ % of the patients in the ZA group , compared to @ % in the placebo group .
Conclusion	ZA was effective in reducing the intensity of LBP in the short term and in reducing the use of NSAIDs within the time span of one year among patients with chronic LBP and MC confirmed in MRI .
Conclusion	Although the results seem encouraging , larger studies are required to analyse the effectiveness and safety of ZA for patients with MC .

Problem	Vasopressin and corticosteroids are both commonly used adjunctive therapies in septic shock .
Problem	Retrospective analyses have suggested that there may be an interaction between these drugs , with higher circulating vasopressin levels and improved outcomes in patients treated with both vasopressin and corticosteroids .
Problem	We aimed to test for an interaction between vasopressin and corticosteroids in septic shock .
Method	Prospective open-label randomized controlled pilot trial .
Method	Four adult ICUs in London teaching hospitals .
Method	Sixty-one adult patients who had septic shock .
Method	Initial vasopressin IV infusion titrated up to @ U/min and then IV hydrocortisone ( @ mg @ hourly ) or placebo .
Method	Plasma vasopressin levels were measured at @-@ and @-@ hours after hydrocortisone/placebo administration .
Result	Thirty-one patients were allocated to vasopressin + hydrocortisone and @ patients to vasopressin + placebo .
Result	The hydrocortisone group required a shorter duration of vasopressin therapy ( @ d ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; shorter in hydrocortisone group ) and required a lower total dose of vasopressin ( ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) compared with the placebo group .
Result	Plasma vasopressin levels were not higher in the hydrocortisone group compared with the placebo group ( @ pmol/L difference at @ - to @-hour time point ; @ % CI , -@ to @ pmol/L ) .
Result	Early vasopressin use was well tolerated with only one serious adverse event possibly related to study drug administration reported .
Result	There were no differences in mortality rates ( @ % @-day mortality in both groups ) or organ failure assessments between the two treatment groups .
Conclusion	Hydrocortisone spared vasopressin requirements , reduced duration , and reduced dose , when used together in the treatment of septic shock , but it did not alter plasma vasopressin levels .
Conclusion	Further trials are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of vasopressin as the initial vasopressor therapy with or without corticosteroids .

Background	About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid-lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke do not take their medication as prescribed .
Background	We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate text messaging as a means of improving adherence to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment .
Method	@ patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering medications were randomly assigned to being sent text messages ( Text group , @ ) or not being sent them ( No text group , @ ) .
Method	Texts were sent daily for @ weeks , alternate days for @ weeks and weekly thereafter for @ weeks ( @ months overall ) , using an automated computer programme .
Method	Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication , whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten , and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so .
Method	At @ months , use of medication was assessed .
Result	Two patients were lost to follow-up , providing data on @ for analysis .
Result	In the No text group @/@ ( @ % ) took less than @ % of the prescribed regimen ( ie .
Result	stopped medication completely or took it on fewer than @ of the last @ days of follow-up ) compared to @/@ patients ( @ % ) in the Text group - an improvement in adherence affecting @ per @ patients ( @ % CI @ to @ ) , p < @ .
Result	The texts reminded @/@ patients ( @ % ) to take medication on at least one occasion and lead to @/@ ( @ % ) who stopped taking medication because of concern over efficacy or side-effects , resuming treatment .
Conclusion	In patients taking blood pressure or lipid-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , text messaging improved medication adherence compared with no text messaging .

Conclusion	Imatinib trough plasma levels < @,@ ng/mL were associated with lower rates of major molecular response .
Conclusion	Because of the wide IIV compared with IOV with imatinib in our study , trough levels may play a role in investigating instances of suboptimal response .

Background	Recently , a number of studies using intra-articular application of tranexamic acid ( IA-TXA ) , with different dosage and techniques , successfully reduced postoperative blood loss in total knee replacement ( TKR ) .
Background	However , best of our knowledge , the very low dose of IA-TXA with drain clamping technique in conventional TKR has not been yet studied .
Background	This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and dose-response effect of two low-dose IA-TXA regimens in conventional TKR on blood loss and blood transfusion reduction .
Method	Between @ and @ , a triple-blinded randomized controlled study was conducted in @ patients undergoing conventional TKR .
Method	The patients were allocated into three groups according to intra-articular solution received : Control group ( physiologic saline ) , TXA-@ group ( TXA @ mg ) , and TXA-@ group ( TXA @ mg ) .
Method	The solution was injected after wound closure followed by drain clamping for @ hours .
Method	Blood loss and transfusion were recorded .
Method	Duplex ultrasound was performed .
Method	Functional outcome and complication were followed for one year .
Result	There were forty-five patients per groups .
Result	The mean total hemoglobin loss was @ g/dL in control group compared with @ g/dL in both TXA groups ( p > @ ) .
Result	Ten patients ( @ % , control ) , six patients ( @ % , TXA-@ ) and none ( TXA-@ ) required transfusion ( p = @ ) .
Result	Thromboembolic events were detected in @ patients ( @ controls , @ TXA-@ , and @ TXA-@ ) .
Result	Functional outcome was non-significant difference between groups .
Conclusion	Combined low-dose IA-TXA , as @ mg , with @-hour clamp drain is effective for reducing postoperative blood loss and transfusion in conventional TKR without significant difference in postoperative knee function or complication .

Background	Radical cystectomy ( RC ) for bladder cancer is frequently associated with delayed gastrointestinal ( GI ) recovery that prolongs hospital length of stay ( LOS ) .
Problem	To assess the efficacy of alvimopan to accelerate GI recovery after RC .
Method	We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing RC and receiving postoperative intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesics .
Method	Oral alvimopan @ mg ( maximum : @ inpatient doses ) versus placebo .
Method	The two-component primary end point was time to upper ( first tolerance of solid food ) and lower ( first bowel movement ) GI recovery ( GI-@ ) .
Method	Time to discharge order written , postoperative LOS , postoperative ileus ( POI ) - related morbidity , opioid consumption , and adverse events ( AEs ) were evaluated .
Method	An independent adjudication of cardiovascular AEs was performed .
Conclusion	Patients were randomized to alvimopan ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) ; @ patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population .
Conclusion	The alvimopan cohort experienced quicker GI-@ recovery ( @ vs @ d ; hazard ratio : @ ; p < @ ) , shorter mean LOS ( @ vs @ d ; p = @ ) , and fewer episodes of POI-related morbidity ( @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) .
Conclusion	The incidence of opioid consumption and AEs or serious AEs ( SAEs ) was comparable except for POI , which was lower in the alvimopan group ( AEs : @ % vs @ % ; SAEs : @ % vs @ % , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Cardiovascular AEs occurred in @ % ( alvimopan ) and @ % ( placebo ) of patients ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Generalizability may be limited due to the exclusion of epidural analgesia and the inclusion of mostly high-volume centers utilizing open laparotomy .
Conclusion	Alvimopan is a useful addition to a standardized care pathway in patients undergoing RC by accelerating GI recovery and shortening LOS , with a safety profile similar to placebo .
Result	This study examined the effects of alvimopan on bowel recovery in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer .
Result	Patients receiving alvimopan experienced quicker bowel recovery and had a shorter hospital stay compared with those who received placebo , with comparable safety .

Problem	To evaluate the changes of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) plasma levels after intravitreal injections of aflibercept or ranibizumab in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
Method	Thirty-eight patients with exudative AMD were included in this randomised , prospective study .
Method	Nineteen patients were randomised to treatment with intravitreal aflibercept ( @ mg ) and @ to intravitreal ranibizumab ( @ mg ) .
Method	The concentration of VEGF was measured by ELISA just before the injection , after @ days and @ month .
Method	Twenty-two age - and sex-matched healthy patients without chorioretinal diseases served as control .
Result	The median baseline plasma VEGF concentration was @ pg/ml in the control group , @ pg/ml in the aflibercept group and @ pg/ml in the ranibizumab group ( p = @ ) .
Result	Seven days after intravitreal injection of aflibercept plasma levels were significantly reduced to values below the minimum detectable dose ( MDD ) in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) resulting in a median VEGF concentration of < @ pg/ml ( p < @ ) .
Result	The reduction persisted throughout @ month with values below the MDD in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) and a median measurement of @ pg/ml ( p < @ ) .
Result	In patients treated with ranibizumab no significant effects could be observed with a baseline VEGF of @ pg/ml , @ pg/ml at @ days ( p = @ ) and @ pg/ml at @ weeks of follow-up ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	After intravitreal aflibercept injection , the systemic VEGF levels were significantly reduced throughout the observational period of @ weeks .
Conclusion	No significant systemic effects of intravitreal ranibizumab on plasma VEGF were observed .

Background	Statins have beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independently of reduction of plasma cholesterol .
Problem	In patients with type @ diabetes and nephropathy , chronic kidney disease stage II-III , we tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin increased systemic and renal nitric oxide ( NO ) availability using L-NMMA as an inhibitor of NO production .
Problem	We performed a randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover study , using atorvastatin/placebo treatment for five days with a standardized diet and fluid intake .
Problem	We measured brachial BP ( bBP ) , central BP ( cBP ) , GFR , urinary output ( OU ) , free water clearance ( CH@O ) , fractional excretion of sodium ( FENa ) , urinary excretion of albumin ( UAER and UACR ) , AQP@ ( u-AQP@ ) and ENaC ( u-ENaC ) and plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones : renin , angiotensin II , aldosterone , arginine vasopressin , endothelin-@ and brain natriuretic peptide .
Result	During atorvastatin and placebo treatment , L-NMMA infusion , changed the effect variables significantly , but to the same extent , i.e. an increase in bBP and cBP , and a decrease in GFR , OU , CH@O , FENa , u-AQP@ and u-ENaC .
Result	In addition , renin and angiotensin II was reduced , aldosterone increased , and vasopressin , endothelin-@ and brain natriuretic hormone unchanged .
Conclusion	During , atorvastatin and placebo treatment , inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis induced the same response in brachial and central blood pressure , GFR , renal tubular function and vasoactive hormones .
Conclusion	Thus , atorvastatin did not change nitric oxide availability in type @ diabetics with nephropathy .

Problem	To examine the effect of repeated-sprint training ( RST ) vs combined RST and resistance training with superimposed vibrations on repeated-sprint ability ( RSA ) and lower-body power output in male rugby players .
Method	Players were divided into @ training groups .
Method	One group performed RST ( n = @ ) @ d/wk and the other performed RST @ d/wk and squat resistance training with superimposed vibrations on the second day ( RS+ST ; n = @ ) .
Method	The squat training was carried out with a volume similar ( ie , number of sets and repetitions ) to that of the RST .
Method	The training period lasted @ wk , and it was carried out as a supplement to the regular rugby training sessions .
Result	Substantial improvements in RSA mean time ( RSA ( mean ) ; +@ % / ES : @ vs +@ % / ES : @ ) , RSA percent decrement ( % Dec ; -@ % / ES : @ vs -@ % / ES : @ ) , and squat absolute power output ( +@ % / ES :@ vs +@ % / ES : @ ) were obtained in RST and RS+ST , respectively .
Result	Substantial improvements in RSA best time ( RSA ( best ) ; +@ % / ES : @ ) and squat power output normalized to body mass ( +@ % / ES : @ ) only occurred in RS+ST .
Result	Both pretest and posttest RSA ( mean ) were largely correlated with the RSA ( best ) .
Result	However , there were only unclear , small to moderate correlations between individual changes in squat power output and either RSA ( mean ) or RSA ( best ) .
Conclusion	Combined RST and resistance training induced improvements of greater magnitude in both repeated-sprint performance and muscle power output than the RST alone .
Conclusion	The lack of substantial correlations between individual changes in repeated-sprint and muscle-power performance suggests that the same subjects were not systematically low or high responders to both RST and strength training .

Problem	Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection is an important sociomedical problem worldwide because the chronification of the disease is frequent and the occurance of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma can be expected .
Problem	The aim of this study was to determine the way of infection , pathohistological changes of the liver , virus genotype presence and sustained virological response after pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy in prison inmates .
Method	The study included @ patients with chronic HCV infection classified in two groups managed during @-@ .
Method	The first group consisted of prisoners ( n = @ ) and the second one of `` non-prisoners '' ( n = @ ) .
Method	The patients from both groups underwent diagnostic preparation ( biochemical analyses , liver biopsy , hepatitis virus detection and genotypisation using polymerase chain reaction issue ) .
Method	The treatment lasted for @ weeks for virus genotypes @ and @ , and @ weeks for genotypes @ and @ .
Result	All the patients were males , approximately the same age ( @ + / - @ and @ + / - @ years ) .
Result	Virus genotype @ was significantly more frequent in the prisoners ( p < @ ) , that demanded longer treatment ( @ weeks ) .
Result	At the same time , statistically significant higher number of patients , `` non-prisoners '' , achieved a sustained virological response ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Intravenous drug abuse and tattoos , separately or together , are the most frequent way of infection in prisoners .
Conclusion	The dominant presence of virus genotype @ resulted in lower number of patients with sustained virological response , probably regardless prison environment and regime .

Problem	To investigate the efficacy of @ weeks of daily low-dose oral prednisolone in improving pain , mobility , and systemic low-grade inflammation in the short term and whether the effect would be sustained at @ weeks in older adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .

Result	The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder rate was @ % in the intervention group and @ % in the placebo group ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Low-dose oral prednisolone had both a short-term and a longer sustained effect resulting in less knee pain , better physical function , and attenuation of systemic inflammation in older patients with knee OA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT@ ) .

Background	Uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) is a significant public health problem among blacks in the United States .
Background	Despite the proven efficacy of therapeutic lifestyle change ( TLC ) on blood pressure ( BP ) reduction in clinical trials , few studies have examined their effectiveness in church-based settings-an influential institution for health promotion in black communities .
Method	Using a cluster-randomized , @-arm trial design , this study evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based TLC intervention vs health education ( HE ) control on BP reduction among hypertensive black adults .
Method	The intervention is delivered by trained lay health advisors through group TLC sessions plus motivational interviewing in @ black churches .
Method	Participants in the intervention group receive @ weekly TLC sessions targeting weight loss , increasing physical activity , fruit , vegetable and low-fat dairy intake , and decreasing fat and sodium intake , plus @ monthly individual motivational interviewing sessions .
Method	Participants in the control group attend @ weekly classes on HTN and other health topics delivered by health care experts .
Method	The primary outcome is change in BP from baseline to @ months .
Method	Secondary outcomes include level of physical activity , percent change in weight , and fruit and vegetable consumption at @ months , and BP control at @ months .
Conclusion	If successful , this trial will provide an alternative and culturally appropriate model for HTN control through evidence-based lifestyle modification delivered in churches by lay health advisors .

Problem	This study aimed to establish the noninferiority of a single-freeze application with CO@ or N@O compared with the standard double freeze with N@O for cryotherapy treatment .
Method	Sixty women undergoing hysterectomy for reasons other than cervical cancer or precancer were randomized to @ of @ techniques as follows : ( @ ) double freeze with N@O , ( @ ) single freeze with N@O , or ( @ ) single freeze with CO@ .
Method	The cervix was separated and cut into anterior and posterior segments , and the deepest area of necrosis was recorded .
Method	Comparisons were made using regression analysis .
Method	The margin of noninferiority was defined as @ mm .
Result	On the anterior lip , a single freeze with N@O was noninferior to a double freeze of the same gas , but on the posterior lip , the single freeze was not .
Result	The single freeze of CO@ did not provide sufficient depth of necrosis in either lip to infer noninferiority versus the double freeze with N@O .
Conclusion	A single freeze with N@O is noninferior to a double-freeze technique in the anterior but not the posterior lip .
Conclusion	However , the result for posterior lips was close to reaching statistical significance .
Conclusion	In addition , CO@ had approximately @ mm shallower depth of necrosis compared with N@O techniques ; however , the clinical implications are unknown .
Conclusion	Given the extensive use of CO@ globally , further clinical evaluation is needed .

Result	One year after loading , Way Milano implants lost an average of @ mm peri-implant bone compared with @ mm of Kentron implants .
Result	Marginal bone level changes were not statistically significant different for Way Milano compared to Kentron implants at @ months ( -@ mm , @ % CI -@ , @ ; P = @ ) and @ year ( -@ mm , @ % CI -@ , @ ; P = @ ) after loading .
Conclusion	No statistically significant differences were observed between the two implant types , although three Kentron implants failed versus none of the Way Milano type .
Conclusion	Longer follow-up of wider patient populations are needed to better understand whether there is an effective advantage with one of the two implant designs .

Background	Despite the availability of new antibiotics such as daptomycin , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) bacteraemia continues to be associated with high clinical failure rates .
Background	Combination therapy has been proposed as an alternative to improve outcomes but there is a lack of clinical studies .
Background	The study aims to demonstrate that combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin achieves higher clinical success rates in the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia than daptomycin alone .
Method	A multicentre open-label , randomised phase III study .
Method	Adult patients hospitalised with MRSA bacteraemia will be randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to group @ : daptomycin @mg/kg/@h intravenous ; or group @ : daptomycin @mg/kg/@h intravenous plus fosfomycin @gr/@g intravenous .
Method	The main outcome will be treatment response at week @ after stopping therapy ( test-of-cure ( TOC ) visit ) .
Method	This is a composite variable with two values : Treatment success : resolution of clinical signs and symptoms ( clinical success ) and negative blood cultures ( microbiological success ) at the TOC visit .
Method	Treatment failure : if any of the following conditions apply : ( @ ) lack of clinical improvement at @h or more after starting therapy ; ( @ ) persistent bacteraemia ( positive blood cultures on day @ ) ; ( @ ) therapy is discontinued early due to adverse effects or for some other reason based on clinical judgement ; ( @ ) relapse of MRSA bacteraemia before the TOC visit ; ( @ ) death for any reason before the TOC visit .
Method	Assuming a @ % cure rate with daptomycin and a @ % difference in cure rates between the two groups , @ patients will be needed for each group ( :@ , : @ ) .
Method	Statistical analysis will be based on intention to treat , as well as per protocol and safety analysis .

Background	There is a strong association between weight gain and metabolic events in patients with schizophrenia receiving many of the second-generation antipsychotic agents .
Background	We explored the relationship between body mass index ( BMI ) and metabolic events in patients with schizophrenia receiving long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate ( PP ) in a long-term trial .
Method	We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from a PP study that included a @-week open-label transition ( TR ) and maintenance phase ; a variable duration , randomized , double-blind ( DB ) , placebo-controlled phase and a @-week open-label extension ( OLE ) phase .
Method	Overall , @ patients received PP continuously from study entry through discontinuation or study completion and were grouped by baseline BMI ( kg/m@ ) : underweight ( BMI < @ ; n = @ , @ % ) , normal-weight ( BMI @ - < @ ; n = @ , @ % ) , overweight ( BMI @ - < @ ; n = @ , @ % ) and obese ( BMI @ ; n = @ , @ % ) .
Method	Metabolic treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) and changes in related laboratory results from TR baseline were analyzed .
Result	PP exposure was similar across BMI groups ; overall mean ( SD ) dose/month was @ ( @ ) mg eq .
Result	-LSB- @ ( @ ) mg -RSB- ; median duration of exposure was @ days ( @ to @ days ) .
Result	Occurrences of metabolic TEAEs overall by group were @ % ( underweight ) , @ % ( normal-weight ) , @ % ( overweight ) , and @ % ( obese ) .
Result	The most common ( @ % ) metabolic TEAE were weight gain and elevated blood levels of glucose , lipids , and insulin .
Result	Mean BMI and weight increased in normal-weight and overweight groups at DB endpoint , and in underweight , normal-weight and overweight groups at OLE endpoint ( p @ ) .
Result	No consistent trend for increased metabolic-related laboratory values by baseline BMI group was observed .
Result	Homeostatic model assessments for insulin resistance indicated preexisting insulin resistance at baseline , with minimal changes at OLE endpoint across baseline BMI groups .
Conclusion	Occurrences of metabolic-related TEAEs trended with greater BMI status in patients with schizophrenia treated with PP ; consistent trends in metabolic-related laboratory values were not observed .

Problem	Despite precise surgical technique , some postoperative facial scars will depress and widen over time , likely due to weakened or inadequately replaced collagen fibers in the underlying dermis .
Problem	The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a @,@ nm ablative carbon dioxide ( CO@ ) fractional laser used early in the post-surgical setting results in improved postoperative facial scars after a single treatment session .
Method	A prospective randomized , comparative split-scar study was conducted on @ subjects between the ages of @-@ .
Method	Subjects underwent Mohs surgery for nonmelanoma skin cancer of the face .
Method	Subsequent to tumor removal , subjects with a linear scar of @ cm or greater were enrolled .
Method	On the day of suture removal , all subjects had one-half of their scar randomly selected and treated with a @,@ nm CO@ fractional laser ( energy = @ mJ ; density = @ % ; spot size = @ mm ; pulse = @ ) .
Method	The untreated scar half served as a control .
Method	Scars were re-evaluated @ weeks later .
Method	An independent blinded observer graded the scar halves with the Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) immediately prior to treatment and @ weeks after treatment .
Method	Subjects completed a visual analog scale ( VAS ) at the same time points .
Result	Three months after laser treatment , a significant decrease in VSS and @ of the @ of its individual parameters were detected in both control and treated halves of the scar .
Result	When comparing the laser group versus the control group , a statistically significant difference was not noted in VSS ( P = @ ) but a statistically significant difference in patient VAS was detected ( P = @ ) .
Result	No side effects of the laser treatment were noted .
Conclusion	Facial wounds sutured in a layered manner heal well .
Conclusion	Patients prefer early fractional CO@ lasing of surgical scars , though use of the VSS failed to detect an objective difference between laser and control halves of scars .
Conclusion	Conservative laser settings , a single session treatment , and VSS insensitivity for surgical scars may influence these findings .

Background	Coordination of the tasks of performing chest compressions and defibrillation can lead to communication challenges that may prolong time spent off the chest .
Background	The purpose of this study was to determine whether defibrillation provided by the provider performing chest compressions led to a decrease in peri-shock pauses as compared to defibrillation administered by a second provider , in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario .
Method	This was a randomized , controlled study measuring pauses in chest compressions for defibrillation in a simulated cardiac arrest model .
Method	We approached hospital providers with current CPR certification for participation between July , @ and October , @ .
Method	Volunteers were randomized to control ( facilitator-administered defibrillation ) or experimental ( compressor-administered defibrillation ) groups .
Method	All participants completed one minute of chest compressions on a mannequin in a shockable rhythm prior to administration of defibrillation .
Method	We measured and compared pauses for defibrillation in both groups .
Result	Out of @ total participants , we analyzed data from @ defibrillations .
Result	Compressor-initiated defibrillation resulted in a significantly lower pre-shock hands-off time ( @ s ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) compared to facilitator-initiated defibrillation ( @ s ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
Result	Furthermore , compressor-initiated defibrillation resulted in a significantly lower peri-shock hands-off time ( @ s ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) compared to facilitator-initiated defibrillation ( @ s ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	Assigning the responsibility for shock delivery to the provider performing compressions encourages continuous compressions throughout the charging period and decreases total time spent off the chest .
Conclusion	However , as this was a simulation-based study , clinical implementation is necessary to further evaluate these potential benefits .

Problem	To investigate the lipid-regulating effect and safety of combined statin and bezafibrate therapy in acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patients complicating with dyslipedemia .
Method	One hundred and four hospitalized patients with established ACS and increased serum triglycerides ( TG ) levels and/or low serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) were selected .
Method	Except for conventional therapy , the patients were randomly divided into @ groups : control group ( n = @ ) , treated with atorvastatin @ mg qn or other statin equivalent to @ mg atorvastatin ; treatment group ( n = @ ) , treated with the same dose statin plus bezafibrate @ mg bid .
Method	The serum levels of total cholesterol ( TC ) , TG , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and HDL-C were assessed before and after @ and @ weeks treatment , side effects and adverse events were recorded .
Result	After @ weeks treatment , the serum levels of TC , TG and LDL-C in two groups were significantly reduced compared to baseline ( all P < @ ) , which were further declined after @ weeks treatment , and the reduction was more significant in treatment group ( @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively ) than in control group ( @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively ) ( all P < @ ) .
Result	After treatment , the serum levels of HDL-C in the two groups were significantly higher than the baseline levels , especially after @ weeks treatment ( all P < @ ) , and the elevations of HDL-C levels in control group and in treatment group were @ % and @ % , respectively , but there were no significant difference between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
Result	After @ weeks , the rates reaching to target goals of LDL-C , TG , HDL-C , and non-HDL-C levels in the treatment group ( @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively ) were significantly higher than those in the control group ( @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively , all P < @ ) .
Result	No serious side effects were observed in the two groups during the treatment period .
Conclusion	The combined statin and bezafibrate treatment is safe and could increase the ratios of reaching target lipid levels in ACS patients complicating with increased TG and ( or ) decreased HDL-C .

Problem	This randomized , cross-over trial was designed to investigate the metabolic and appetitive responses to skipping breakfast in overweight women who were habitual breakfast Eaters or Skippers .
Method	Nine Eaters and nine Skippers were studied on two separate days during which subjects ate breakfast ( B ) or had no breakfast ( NB ) , followed by a standard lunch meal @ h later .
Method	Blood sampling for hormones and metabolites was performed after lunch , and appetite was rated throughout the day .
Result	Interactions between day and habitual breakfast pattern were seen for area under the curve ( AUC ) for insulin and free fatty acids ( FFA ) .
Result	Both insulin ( P = @ ) and FFA ( P = @ ) AUC were higher on the NB day for Eaters but similar on both days for Skippers .
Result	Eaters had higher pre lunch hunger AUC on the NB day ( P = @ ) as well as lower pre lunch satiety AUC under both conditions ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Overall , this study showed that the adverse effects of skipping breakfast ( higher insulin and FFA responses to lunch , increased hunger , and decreased satiety ) were found primarily in habitual breakfast eaters .
Conclusion	This suggests that meal skipping may have enhanced effects in habitual Eaters due to entrainment of metabolic and appetitive regulatory systems .

Background	Although obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes , it remains unclear whether OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) has metabolic benefits .
Problem	To determine the effect of @-hour nightly CPAP treatment on glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes and OSA .
Method	In a randomized controlled parallel group study , @ participants were randomly assigned to receive either @-hour nightly CPAP ( n = @ ) or oral placebo ( n = @ ) .
Method	Sleep was polysomnographically recorded in the laboratory on each night .
Method	CPAP adherence was ensured by continuous supervision .
Method	Participants continued their daily routine activities outside the laboratory .
Method	Glucose metabolism was assessed at baseline and after @ weeks of assigned treatment using both the oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests .
Method	The primary outcome was the overall glucose response as quantified by the area under the curve for glucose during @-hour oral glucose tolerance testing .
Method	Secondary outcomes included fasting and @-hour glucose and insulin , the area under the curves for insulin and insulin secretion , norepinephrine , insulin sensitivity , acute insulin response to glucose , and @-hour blood pressure .

Conclusion	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT @ ) .

Background	People with stroke excessively move their trunk , when reaching and grasping objects .
Problem	To determine if the addition of trunk restraint to modified constraint-induced movement therapy ( mCIMT ) was better than mCIMT alone in improving strength , function , and quality of life after stroke .
Method	A pilot randomized double-blinded clinical trial was conducted .
Method	Twenty-two participants with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to an experimental group that received mCIMT plus trunk restraint , or a control group ( only mCIMT ) .
Method	Primary outcomes were the amount of use and quality of movement of the paretic upper limb ( UL ) , determined by the Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) scores .
Method	Secondary outcomes included the observed performance of the paretic UL during unimanual and bimanual tasks , kinematics of reaching , strength , and quality of life .
Result	Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in the MAL scores and in the time to perform bimanual activities immediately after the interventions .
Result	However , no between-group differences were observed .
Conclusion	The addition of trunk restraint to mCIMT resulted in no additional benefits , compared with mCIMT alone with stroke individuals with mild to moderate impairments .
Conclusion	Unimanual and bimanual improvements were observed after mCIMT , regardless of trunk restraint , and the intervention did not adversely affect their reaching patterns .

Problem	Examine longitudinal associations between sources of social support and social undermining for healthy eating and physical activity and weight change .
Method	Data are from @ employed adults participating in a cluster-randomized multilevel weight gain prevention intervention .
Method	Primary predictors included social support and social undermining for two types of behaviors ( healthy eating and physical activity ) from three sources ( family , friends , and coworkers ) obtained via self-administered surveys .
Method	The primary outcome ( weight in kg ) was measured by trained staff .
Method	Data were collected at baseline , @ months , and @ months .
Method	Linear multivariable models examined the association of support and social undermining with weight over time , adjusting for intervention status , time , gender , age , education , and clustering of individuals within schools .
Result	Adjusting for all primary predictors and covariates , friend support for healthy eating ( = -@ ) , coworker support for healthy eating ( = -@ ) , and family support for physical activity ( = -@ ) were associated with weight reduction at @ months ( P-values < @ ) .
Result	Family social undermining for healthy eating was associated with weight gain at @ months ( = @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Among adult employees , friend and coworker support for healthy eating and family support for physical activity predicted improved weight management .
Conclusion	Interventions that help adults navigate family social undermining of healthy eating are warranted .

Problem	To evaluate whether @-mm long implants could be a suitable alternative to longer implants placed in vertically augmented atrophic posterior mandibles .
Method	Sixty partially edentulous patients having @ to @ mm of residual crestal height and at least @ mm thickness measured on CT scans above the mandibular canal were randomised according to a parallel group design .
Method	They were either to receive @ to @ submerged @-mm long implants or @ mm or longer implants ( @ patients per group ) placed in vertically augmented bone .
Method	Bone was augmented with interpositional anorganic bovine bone blocks covered by resorbable barriers .
Method	Grafts were left to heal for @ months before implant placement .
Method	Four months after provisional acrylic prostheses were delivered , they were replaced , after @ months , by definitive metal-ceramic prostheses .
Method	Outcome measures were : prosthesis and implant failures ; complications ; and radiographic peri-implant marginal bone level changes .
Method	All patients were followed up to @ years after loading .
Result	Five years after loading , @ patients dropped out : @ from the short implant group and @ from the augmented group .
Result	The augmentation procedure failed in @ patients and only @-mm long implants could be inserted .
Result	There were no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures .
Result	Five prostheses failed in @ patients of the short implant group versus @ prostheses in @ patients in the augmented group ( Fishers exact test P = @ ; difference in proportions = @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
Result	Five short implants failed in @ patients versus @ long implants in @ patients ( Fishers exact test P = @ difference in proportions = @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ) .
Result	There were statistically more complications in augmented patients ( @ complications in @ augmented patients versus @ complications in @ patients of the short implant group ) ( Fishers exact test P < @ ; difference in proportions = @ ; @ % CI @ , @ ) .
Result	Both groups gradually lost peri-implant bone in a statistically significant way .
Result	Five years after loading , short implant group patients lost an average of @ mm peri-implant bone compared with @ mm in the augmented group .
Result	Short implants experienced statistically significantly less bone loss ( @ mm , @ % CI @ ; @ , P < @ ) than long implants .
Conclusion	When residual bone height over the mandibular canal is between @ to @ mm , @ mm short implants could be an interesting alternative to vertical augmentation in posterior atrophic mandibles since the treatment is faster , cheaper and associated with less morbidity .
Conclusion	Longer follow-ups may still be needed to confirm these results , however the medium-term prognosis ( @ years after loading ) of short implants is at least as good as those of longer implants placed vertically in augmented mandibles .

Background	Most randomised clinical trials ( RCTs ) testing a new health service do not allow a run-in period of consolidation before evaluating the new approach .
Background	Consequently , health professionals involved may feel insufficiently familiar or confident , or that new processes or systems that are integral to the service are insufficiently embedded in routine care prior to definitive evaluation in a RCT .
Background	This study aimed to determine the optimal run-in period for a new physiotherapy-led telephone assessment and treatment service known as PhysioDirect and whether a run-in was needed prior to evaluating outcomes in an RCT .
Method	The PhysioDirect trial assessed whether PhysioDirect was as effective as usual care .
Method	Prior to the main trial , a run-in of up to @ weeks was permitted to facilitate physiotherapists to become confident in delivering the new service .
Method	Outcomes collected from the run-in and main trial were length of telephone calls within the PhysioDirect service and patients ' physical function ( SF-@v@ questionnaire ) and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile v@ collected at baseline and six months .
Method	Joinpoint regression determined how long it had taken call times to stabilise .
Method	Analysis of covariance determined whether patients ' physical function at six months changed from the run-in to the main trial .
Result	Mean PhysioDirect call times ( minutes ) were higher in the run-in ( @ ( SD : @ ) ) than in the main trial ( @ ( SD : @ ) ) .
Result	Each physiotherapist needed to answer @ ( @ % CI : @,@ ) calls for their mean call time to stabilise at @ minutes per call ; this took a minimum of seven weeks .
Result	For patients ' physical function , PhysioDirect was equally clinically effective as usual care during both the run-in ( @ ( @ % CI : -@,@ ) ) and main trial ( -@ ( @ % CI : -@,@ ) ) .
Conclusion	A run-in was not needed in a large trial testing PhysioDirect services in terms of patient outcomes .
Conclusion	A learning curve was evident in the process measure of telephone call length .
Conclusion	This decreased during the run-in and stabilised prior to commencement of the main trial .
Conclusion	Future trials should build in a run-in if it is anticipated that learning would have an effect on patient outcome .

Background	Friction blister research has focused on prevention and treatment approaches rather than exploring the pathophysiology of the friction blister .
Background	Increased skin hydration has been purported to be a key risk factor in friction blister development .
Background	This study aimed to test the effect of increased skin surface hydration on the risk of friction blister creation .
Method	The skin on one foot was hydrated by soaking the foot in water .
Method	Intermittent loading was carried out until an observable change of @C was evident using infrared thermography .
Method	The contra lateral foot acted as a control .
Method	Skin hydration and elasticity was measured using electrical capacitance and negative pressure respectively .
Result	The rate of temperature change of the hydrated group was significantly greater than that of the non-hydrated foot group ( P = @ ) and showed a strong positive correlation ( r = @ ) with skin surface hydration .
Result	Weak negative correlations were seen between skin elasticity and rate of temperature change in response to load application ( r = -@ ) and skin surface hydration and elasticity at baseline ( r = -@ ) .
Conclusion	In controlled experimental conditions increased skin surface hydration increases the rate of temperature change of the skin in response to load application and consequently increases the risk of blister creation .

Background	Diabetes prevention is a public health priority that is dependent upon the reach , effectiveness , and cost of intervention strategies .
Background	However , understanding each of these outcomes within the context of randomized controlled trials is problematic .
Problem	To describe the methods and design of a hybrid preference/randomized control trial using the RE-AIM framework .
Method	The trial , which was developed using the RE-AIM framework , will contrast the effects of @ interventions : ( @ ) a standard care , small group , diabetes prevention education class ( SG ) , ( @ ) the small group intervention plus @ months of interactive voice response telephone follow-up ( SG-IVR ) , and ( @ ) a DVD version of the small group intervention with the same IVR follow-up ( DVD-IVR ) .
Method	Each intervention includes personal action planning with a focus on key elements of the lifestyle intervention from the Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) .
Method	Adult patients at risk for diabetes will be randomly assigned to either choice or RCT .
Method	Those assigned to choice ( n = @ ) will have the opportunity to choose between SG-IVR and DVD-IVR .
Method	Those assigned to RCT group ( n = @ ) will be randomly assigned to SG , SG-IVR , or DVD-IRV .
Method	Assessment of primary ( weight loss , reach , & cost ) and secondary ( physical activity , & dietary intake ) outcomes will occur at baseline , @ , @ , and @ months .
Conclusion	This will be the first diabetes prevention trial that will allow the research team to determine the relationships between reach , effectiveness , and cost of different interventions .

Problem	To explore the impacts on the cognitive level of the children with mental retardation ( MR ) treated with JIN 's three scalp needling therapy and the training for cognitive and perceptual disturbance so as to seek the more effective therapeutic method for the treatment of MR in children .
Problem	Methods Sixty-six MR children were randomized into a head-point needle-retaining therapy + training group ( group A ) and a training after acupuncture group ( group B ) .
Problem	Seven cases and @ cases were dropped in the two groups respectively .
Problem	Twenty-six cases accomplished the treatment in the group A and @ cases in the group B.
Problem	In the group A , the points on the head were stimulated and the needles were retained ( @ min after the general acupuncture , the needles on the body points were removed ; and those on the head points were retained for @ h , including Sishenzhen , Naosanzhen , Zhisanzhen and Niesanzhen ) .
Problem	Simultaneously , the training for the cognitive perceptual disturbance was combined .
Problem	In the group B , @ h after needle retaining at the body points and head points , all the needles were removed ; the training for the cognitive perceptual disturbance was followed .
Problem	The treatment was given once a day , and the treatment for @ months was required .
Problem	Before and after treatment , the Wechsler intelligence scale for children ( WISC ) was used for evaluation and observation of verbal intelligence quotient ( VIQ ) , performance intelligence quotient ( PIQ ) and full-scale intelligence quotient ( TFIQ ) and score changes of @ items such as information , picture vocabu ; lary , arithmetic , picture generalization , comprehension , etc. .
Result	After treatment , FIQ , VIQ and PIQ scores were different significantly as compared with those before treatment ( all P < @ ) .
Result	In the group A , the results of picture vocabulary , animal egg laying , maze , block design and geometric figure were all improved significantly ( all P < @ ) .
Result	In the group B , the results of information , comprehension , block design and geometric figure were all improved significantly ( all P < @ ) .
Result	After treatment , concerning the value difference in FIQ and PIQ of the two groups ; the changes in the group A were more significant ( both P < @ ) .
Result	After treatment , the results of picture vocabulary and maze were improved significantly in the group A as compared with the group B ( both P < .
Result	@ ) .
Result	The IQ categories changed apparently after treatment in the two groups , toward the higher level in tendency generally , but without significant difference ( both P > @ ) .
Conclusion	The simultaneous treatment with head point retaining of JIN 's three needling therapy and the training for cognitive and perceptual disturbance obviously improves children patients ' verbal comprehension , expression ability , hand-eye coordination ability , attention , logical reasoning ability and visual perception .
Conclusion	The efficacy is better than that in the treatment of the training after acupuncture .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the activity of agmatine , an inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) inhibitor and selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonist , on reducing tissue damage in distal part of traumatic nerve in an experimental rat peripheral nerve injury model .

Result	When group @ was compared with group @ , axonolysis was less in group @ ( p = @ ) , as was axon degeneration ( p = @ ) and edema ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This study demonstrated agmatine to have antioxidant and antineurotoxic effects in an experimental rat peripheral nerve injury model .

Background	The surgical wound of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) needs continuous flexion and extension movement .
Background	Silicone gel treatment is widely used to treat hypertrophic scars and keloids since it is easily applied and prevents scar pain and itching .
Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of silicone gel applied to surgical scars of TKA on postoperative scar pain and pruritus .
Method	One hundred TKAs were randomized into a silicone gel group ( silicone gel was applied to the wound after stitch-out for @ month ) or a placebo group .
Method	The postoperative scar pain and pruritus were evaluated with the use of a visual analog scale ( VAS ) at postoperative @ months , @ months and @ year .
Method	Scar assessment was done using the Vancouver scar scale by evaluating scar pigmentation , vascularity , pliability , and height .
Result	Although silicone gel group showed better pigmentation and height scales than placebo group ( P < @ ) , there were no significant differences in the postoperative scar pain and pruritus VAS scores between the groups ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	Application of silicone gel had no beneficial effects on scar pain and itching relief during the early postoperative period of TKA .
Method	I-Randomized Controlled Trial .

Background	Various studies have linked the occurrence of cardiovascular events and low ambient temperatures as well as the morning blood pressure surge ( MBPS ) .
Background	We hypothesized that low ambient temperatures produce a higher sympathetic change during the last rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep transition and that this may play an important role in cold-related cardiovascular events .
Method	All experiments were carried out on @ healthy male adults , aged @ years , who participated in two experimental conditions randomly ( > @ day apart ) : warm ( @ C ) and cold ( @C ) .
Method	Blood pressure ( BP ) was measured every @ min for @ h by autonomic ambulatory BP monitoring .
Method	The electroencephalograms , electrocardiograms , ambient temperature , near-body temperature , and physical activity were recorded by miniature polysomnography for @ h.
Result	The cold conditions resulted in : ( i ) higher MBPS than under warm conditions ; ( ii ) significant and greater sympathetic index changes during the sleep-wake transition than during cover-to-uncover and supine-to-sit position tests ; ( iii ) the non-REM-REM transition-related sympathetic elevation during the cold conditions being significantly higher in late sleep period than in early sleep period ; ( iv ) at @h prior to morning awakening , the value of total power of heart rate variability changes being significantly negatively correlated with the changes of near-body temperature ; and ( v ) significantly higher arousal index and shorter average interval of REM periods than in warm conditions .
Conclusion	Cold exposure elevates the amplitude of MBPS and is associated with late sleep stage transition sympathetic activation , which might have important implications for cold-related cardiovascular events .

Background	Current guidelines recommend treatment of significant coronary artery disease by concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement .
Background	However there is no consensus as to how best to treat coronary disease in high-risk patients requiring transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) .
Method	The percutaneous coronary intervention prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( ACTIVATION ) trial is a randomized , controlled open-label trial of @ patients randomized to treatment of significant coronary artery disease by percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI - test arm ) or no PCI ( control arm ) .
Method	Significant coronary disease is defined as @ lesion of @ % severity in a major epicardial vessel or @ % in a vein graft or protected left main stem lesion .
Method	The trial tests the hypothesis that the strategy of performing pre-TAVI PCI is non-inferior to not treating such coronary stenoses with PCI prior to TAVI , with a composite primary outcome of @-month mortality and rehospitalization .
Method	Secondary outcomes include efficacy end-points such as @-day mortality , safety endpoints including bleeding , burden of symptoms , and quality of life ( assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ) .
Method	In conclusion , we hope that using a definition of coronary artery disease severity closer to that used in everyday practice by interventional cardiologists - rather than the @ % severity used in surgical guidelines - will provide robust evidence to direct guidelines regarding TAVI therapy and improve its safety and efficacy profile of this developing technique .

Problem	To study the influence of aerobic exercise training on brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , insulin resistance , and lipid profile in middle-aged men diagnosed with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) .
Method	This is an experimental repeated measure study .
Method	Subjects participated in aerobic training programs ( @ sessions of @-@ minutes per session ) in Guilan University gymnasium and court .
Method	A total of @ middle-aged men ( @-@ years old ) diagnosed with MetS participated .
Method	We randomly divided @ middle-aged men with MetS into exercise and control groups .
Method	The exercise group followed an aerobic training program ( @ sessions , @/wk ) at @ % to @ % of V -LSB- Combining Dot Above -RSB- O@ peak ( @-@ minutes per session ) and @ weeks of detraining .
Method	Blood samples were collected at baseline , end of the training , and detraining .
Method	High BDNF level in patients with MetS and its reduction after chronic aerobic exercise .
Result	Aerobic training significantly decreased all the metabolic risk factors , including overall MetS z score , insulin resistance , and lipid profile ( P < @ ) .
Result	After the detraining period , plasma triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein , and also overall MetS z score remained unchanged ( P < @ ) ; however , serum BDNF , which was decreased by aerobic training ( P = @ ) , restored to the baseline at the end of the detraining ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Improved metabolic risk factors along with decreased serum BDNF in response to aerobic training and the opposite direction during the detraining emphasize the importance of physical activity in the treatment of MetS and prevention of related diseases .

Problem	Local anesthetic wound infiltration is widely used as an effective adjunct during multimodal postoperative pain management .
Problem	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous wound infusion of ropivacaine in postoperative pain relief , opioid sparing , incidence of nausea and vomiting , and bowel and liver function improvement in patients undergoing open hepatectomy .
Method	Forty patients undergoing open hepatectomy were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial .
Method	Patients were divided into @ groups : the @ % saline continuous infusion group ( the control group ; n = @ ) and the ropivacaine continuous infusion group ( the Ropi group ; n = @ ) .
Method	Outcomes measured postoperatively were pain score at rest and on movement , sufentanil consumption , incidence of nausea and vomiting , and sedation score across @ postoperative hours .
Method	Time to bowel recovery , liver function change , mean length of hospitalization , patient satisfaction , and other data after @ postoperative hours were collected until hospital discharge .
Result	Pain scores at rest were lower for the ropivacaine group and reached significance after @ and @ hours ( P < @ ) .
Result	Sufentanil consumption ( @ vs. @ g ; P < @ ) after @ hours , time to bowel recovery ( @ vs. @ d ; P < @ ) , incidence of nausea and vomiting ( @ vs. @ ; P < @ ) , and mean length of hospitalization ( @ vs. @ d ; P < @ ) were significantly reduced , and the sedation score and liver function change were also comparable between the @ groups .
Result	There was no difference with respect to pain scores on movement , nor with respect to patient satisfaction .
Conclusion	Surgical wound infusion with ropivacaine after hepatectomy can improve pain relief at rest and accelerate recovery and discharge .

Background	Hemodialysis patients are at risk of serious health complications , yet treatment non-adherence remains high .
Problem	Warnings about health risks associated with non-adherence may trigger defensive reactions .
Problem	We studied whether an intervention based on self-affirmation theory ( Steele @ ) reduced patients ' resistance to health-risk information and improved adherence .
Method	One hundred twelve patients either self-affirmed or completed a matched control task before reading about the risks associated with a lack of phosphate control .
Method	Serum phosphate was collected from baseline up to @months .
Result	Self-affirmed patients had significantly reduced serum phosphate levels at @ and @months .
Result	However , contrary to the predictions derived from self-affirmation theory , self-affirmed participants and controls did not differ in their evaluation of the health-risk information , behavioural intention or self-efficacy .
Conclusion	A low-cost , high-reach health intervention based on self-affirmation theory was shown to reduce serum phosphate over a @month period .
Conclusion	Further work is required to identify mediators of the observed effects .

Problem	The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of bladder training before removing the indwelling urinary catheter in patients with acute urinary retention ( AUR ) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .
Method	In total , @ consecutive patients with their first episode of spontaneous AUR associated with BPH were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial .
Method	They were randomly assigned to be given either pharmacological treatment combined with bladder training or pharmacological treatment ( tamsulosin @ mg and finasteride @ mg once daily ) with free drainage of urinary catheter for @ days , and a trial without catheter ( TWOC ) was performed .
Method	Data on patients ' baseline demographics , history of BPH , International Prostate Symptom Score , prostate size , serum prostate-specific antigen , intravesical prostatic protrusion , TWOC success rates and related complications were collected and statistically analysed .
Result	The two groups of spontaneous AUR patients with BPH were given pharmacological treatment combined with bladder training before catheter removal ( n = @ ) or pharmacological treatment alone ( n = @ ) for @ days .
Result	All @ patients underwent a first TWOC with an overall success rate of @ % after first @ days ' catheterization ; TWOC was successful in @ % of cases in the intervention group and @ % in the control group .
Result	There was no statistically significant difference in TWOC success rate between the two groups ( p > @ ) .
Conclusion	This randomized controlled trial showed that bladder training before urinary catheter removal did not increase the chance of TWOC success significantly in spontaneous AUR patients with BPH .

Background	UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) specify recommendations for the treatment and management of OCD using a stepped care approach .
Background	Steps three to six of this model recommend treatment options for people with OCD that range from low-intensity guided self-help ( GSH ) to more intensive psychological and pharmacological interventions .
Background	Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , including exposure and response prevention , is the recommended psychological treatment .
Background	However , whilst there is some preliminary evidence that self-managed therapy packages for OCD can be effective , a more robust evidence base of their clinical and cost effectiveness and acceptability is required .
Method	Our proposed study will test two different self-help treatments for OCD : @ ) computerised CBT ( cCBT ) using OCFighter , an internet-delivered OCD treatment package ; and @ ) GSH using a book .
Method	Both treatments will be accompanied by email or telephone support from a mental health professional .
Method	We will evaluate the effectiveness , cost and patient and health professional acceptability of the treatments .
Conclusion	This study will provide more robust evidence of efficacy , cost effectiveness and acceptability of self-help treatments for OCD .
Conclusion	If cCBT and/or GSH prove effective , it will provide additional , more accessible treatment options for people with OCD .

Background	In literature there is a general consensus that the use of the mirror improves proprioception .
Background	During rehabilitation the mirror is an important instrument to improve stability .
Background	In some sports , such as dancing , mirrors are widely used during training .
Background	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a mirror on balance in young dancers .
Background	Sixty-four young dancers ( ranging from @-@ years ) were included in this study .
Background	Thirty-two attending lessons with a mirror ( mirror - group ) were compared to @ young dancers that attended the same lessons without a mirror ( non-mirror group ) .
Background	Balance was evaluated by BESS ( Balance Error Scoring System ) , which consists of three stances ( double limb , single limb , and tandem ) on two surfaces ( firm and foam ) .
Background	The errors were assessed at each stance and summed to create the two subtotal scores ( firm and foam surface ) and the final total score ( BESS ) .
Background	The BESS was performed at recruitment ( T@ ) and after @months of dance lessons ( T@ ) .
Result	The repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed that for the BESS total score there is a difference due to the time ( F = @ ; p < @ ) .
Result	No other differences due to the group or to the time of measurement were found ( p > @ ) .
Result	The analysis of the multiple regression model showed the influence of the values at T@ for every BESS items and the dominance of limb for stability on an unstable surface standing on one or two legs .
Conclusion	These preliminary results suggest that the use of a mirror in a ballet classroom does not improve balance acquisition of the dancer .
Conclusion	On the other hand , improvement found after @months confirms that at the age of the dancers studied motor skills and balance can easily be trained and improved .

Conclusion	The combined therapy of fire needling technique and filiform needle acupuncture improves the efficacy and sustains the efficacy especially on cervical headache without bony pathological changing .

Problem	Insulin degludec/insulin aspart ( IDegAsp ) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action , and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection .
Problem	This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart @ ( BIAsp @ ) in adults with type @ diabetes inadequately controlled with once - or twice-daily ( OD or BID ) pre - or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs .
Method	In this @-week , randomized , open-label , multinational , treat-to-target trial , participants ( mean age @ years , duration of diabetes @ years , BMI @ kg/m ( @ ) , and HbA@c @ % -LSB- @ mmol/mol -RSB- ) were exposed ( @:@ ) to BID injections of IDegAsp ( n = @ ) or BIAsp @ ( n = @ ) , administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose ( PG ) target of @-@ @ mmol/L .
Result	After @ weeks , mean HbA@c was @ % ( @ mmol/mol ) for both groups , with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA@c ( estimated treatment difference -LSB- ETD -RSB- -@ % points -LSB- @ % CI -@ to @ -RSB- ) .
Result	Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG ( ETD -@ mmol/L -LSB- @ % CI -@ to -@ -RSB- , P < @ ) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose ( estimated rate ratio @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- , P = @ ) .
Result	Fewer confirmed , nocturnal confirmed , and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp @ .
Conclusion	IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA@c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp @ in patients with uncontrolled type @ diabetes previously treated with once - or twice-daily pre - or self-mixed insulin .

Background	Chronic alcohol abuse has been traditionally associated with impaired cognitive abilities .
Background	The deficits are most evident in higher order cognitive functions , such as abstract reasoning , problem solving and visuospatial processing .
Background	The present study sought to increase current understanding of the neuropsychological basis of poor abstract reasoning abilities in alcohol-dependent subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
Method	An abstract reasoning task-based fMRI study was carried out on alcohol-dependent subjects ( n = @ ) and healthy controls ( n = @ ) to examine neural activation pattern .
Method	The study was carried out using a @-T whole-body magnetic resonance scanner .
Method	Preprocessing and post processing was performed using SPM @ software .
Result	Behavioral data indicated that alcohol-dependent subjects took more time than controls for performing the task but there was no significant difference in their response accuracy .
Result	Analysis of the fMRI data indicated that for solving abstract reasoning-based problems , alcohol-dependent subjects showed enhanced right frontoparietal neural activation involving inferior frontal gyrus , post central gyrus , superior parietal lobule , and occipito-temporal gyrus .
Conclusion	The extensive activation observed in alcohol dependents as compared to controls suggests that alcohol dependents recruit additional brain areas to meet the behavioral demands for equivalent task performance .
Conclusion	The results are consistent with previous fMRI studies suggesting decreased neural efficiency of relevant brain networks or compensatory mechanisms for the execution of task for showing an equivalent performance .

Background	Exercise has been proposed as a possible treatment for postprandial hypotension ( PPH ) , yet , its use has not been extensively investigated .
Background	This study aimed to determine the effects of intermittent walking on blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) following ingestion of a glucose drink in older people with PPH .
Method	Thirteen persons with PPH were recruited and studied on @ randomized days ( control , intervention ) .
Method	On both study days , participants ingested @ mL of water containing @ g glucose , followed by ambulatory BP and HR monitoring @ minutely for @ minutes , then @ minutely until @ minutes .
Method	On the intervention day , participants walked at their usual pace for @ m every @ minutes for @ minutes .
Result	On the control day , significant falls in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ( P < @ ) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ( P = @ ) were demonstrated between t = @-@ minutes .
Result	On the intervention day , over the same period , there was no significant fall in SBP ( P = @ ) , however , DBP still fell significantly ( P = @ ) .
Result	There was a statistically significant difference ( P = @ ) for the area under the curve for the change in SBP from baseline for the study days but not DBP ( P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant change in HR ( control : P = @ ; intervention , P = @ ) nor between the area under the curve ( P = @ ) for the change in HR from baseline for the study days .
Conclusion	This study suggests that in older people with PPH , intermittent walking at a usual pace attenuates the fall in SBP after ingestion of a glucose drink .

Background	Modern clinical trials with short-term follow-up indicate CAS and CEA are equivalent in reducing the risk for ipsilateral ischemic stroke secondary to carotid stenosis .
Background	A paucity of data exists regarding long-term outcomes .
Method	Patients of all surgical risks with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis ( > @ % ) were randomly selected for CEA or CAS and followed a minimum of @ years .
Result	Long-term follow-up was achieved in @ patients ( @ % ) .
Result	Eighty-seven ( @ % ) died within this period , most commonly of nonvascular causes .
Result	No difference in the risk of stroke ipsilateral to the treated artery was noted among treatment groups ( p > @ ) .
Result	Restenosis determined by sequential ultrasound was assessed only in the CAS group ( @ % ) and remained asymptomatic .
Result	The combined risk of fatal or nonfatal heart attack over the @-year period was highest in individuals with symptomatic versus asymptomatic stenosis ( @ % vs. @ % ; hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- : @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : @ to @ , p = @ ) and was higher in all patients treated with CEA ( HR : @ , @ % CI : @ to @ , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Long-term protection against ipsilateral stroke provided by CAS and CEA did not differ in this trial .
Conclusion	The @-year risk of fatal/nonfatal myocardial infarction was highest in all patients harboring symptomatic carotid stenosis at enrollment .
Conclusion	The risk of fatal/nonfatal heart attack was significantly more prevalent in those symptomatic or asymptomatic patients randomized to CEA .

Conclusion	Daily consumption of milk containing probiotic bacteria can reduce the levels of mutans streptococci and may contribute to the prevention of dental caries .

Problem	Behavioral measures are often used to distinguish subgroups of patients with stroke ( eg , to predict treatment gains , stratify clinical trial enrollees , or select rehabilitation therapy ) .
Problem	In studies of the upper extremity , measures of brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) have also been found useful , but this approach has not been examined for the lower extremity .
Problem	The current study hypothesized that an fMRI-based measure of cortical function would significantly improve prediction of treatment-induced lower extremity behavioral gains .
Problem	Biomarkers of treatment gains were also explored .
Method	Patients with hemiparesis @ to @ months after stroke were enrolled in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial of ropinirole + physical therapy versus placebo + physical therapy , results of which have previously been reported ( NCT@ ) .
Method	( @ ) Primary end point was change in gait velocity .
Method	Enrollees underwent baseline multimodal assessment that included @ measures spanning @ assessment categories ( medical history , impairment , disability , brain injury , and brain function ) , and also underwent reassessment @ weeks after end of therapy .
Result	In bivariate analysis , @ baseline measures belonging to @ categories ( medical history , impairment , disability , and brain function ) significantly predicted change in gait velocity .
Result	Prediction was strongest , however , using a multivariate model containing @ measures ( leg Fugl-Meyer score and fMRI activation volume within ipsilesional foot sensorimotor cortex ) .
Result	Increased activation volume within bilateral foot primary sensorimotor cortex correlated positively with treatment-induced leg motor gains .
Conclusion	A multimodal model incorporating behavioral and fMRI measures best predicted treatment-induced changes in gait velocity in a clinical trial setting .
Conclusion	Results also suggest potential use of fMRI measures as biomarkers of treatment gains .

Problem	To compare best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) and central macular thickness ( CMT ) after @-nm subthreshold laser grid photocoagulation and threshold laser grid photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic macular oedema ( DME ) .
Method	Twenty-three patients ( @ eyes ) with binocular DME were enroled in this study .
Method	The two eyes of each patient were divided into a subthreshold photocoagulation group and a threshold photocoagulation group .
Method	The eyes of the subthreshold group underwent @-nm patter scan laser system ( PASCAL ) @ % end point subthreshold laser grid photocoagulation therapy , whereas the threshold photocoagulation group underwent short-pulse grid photocoagulation with a @-nm PASCAL system .
Method	BCVA and CMT were assessed in all patients before treatment , @ days after treatment , and @ , @ , and @ months after treatment .
Result	After grid photocoagulation , the mean BCVA improved in both the subthreshold group , and the threshold group , and the two groups did not differ statistically significantly from each other .
Result	Similarly , the macular oedema diminished in both groups after treatment , and the two groups did not differ statistically significantly from each other with regard to CMT .
Conclusion	Both @-nm subthreshold laser grid photocoagulation and threshold laser grid photocoagulation can improve the visual acuity and reduce CMT in DME patients .

Background	Short children born small for gestational age ( SGA ) are treated with a GH dose based on body size , but treatment may lead to high levels of IGF@ .
Background	The objective was to evaluate IGF@ titration of GH dose in contrast to current dosing strategies .
Method	In the North European Small-for-Gestational-Age Study ( NESGAS ) , @ short pre-pubertal children born SGA were randomised after @ year of high-dose GH treatment ( @g/kg per day ) to three different regimens : high dose ( @g/kg per day ) , low dose ( @g/kg per day ) or IGF@ titration .
Result	The average dose during the second year of the randomised trial did not differ between the IGF@ titration group ( @g/kg per day , s.d. @ ) and the low-dose group ( @g/kg per day , s.d. @ ; P = @ ) , but there was a wide variation in the IGF@ titration group ( range @-@g / kg per day ) .
Result	The IGF@ titration group had significantly lower height gain ( @ SDS , s.d. @ ) during the second year of the randomised trial compared with the high-dose group ( @ SDS , s.d. @ ) , but not significantly lower than the low-dose group ( @ SDS , s.d. @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	The IGF@ titration group had lower IGF@ levels after @ years of the trial ( mean @ , s.d. @ ) compared with both the low-dose ( mean @ , s.d. @ ) and the high-dose ( mean @ , s.d. @ ) groups .
Conclusion	IGF@ titration of GH dose in SGA children proved less effective than current dosing strategies .
Conclusion	IGF@ titration resulted in physiological IGF@ levels with a wide range of GH dose and a poorer growth response , which indicates the role of IGF@ resistance and highlights the heterogeneity of short SGA children .

Problem	To determine whether the application of occlusive wrap applied immediately after birth will reduce mortality in very preterm infants .
Method	This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of infants born @@/@ to @@/@ weeks ' gestation who were assigned randomly to occlusive wrap or no wrap .
Method	The primary outcome was all cause mortality at discharge or @ months ' corrected age .
Method	Secondary outcomes included temperature , Apgar scores , pH , base deficit , blood pressure and glucose , respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , seizures , patent ductus arteriosus , necrotizing enterocolitis , gastrointestinal perforation , intraventricular hemorrhage , cystic periventricular leukomalacia , pulmonary hemorrhage , retinopathy of prematurity , sepsis , hearing screen , and pneumothorax .
Result	Eight hundred one infants were enrolled .
Result	There was no difference in baseline population characteristics .
Result	There were no significant differences in mortality ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	Wrap infants had statistically significant greater baseline temperatures ( @ C wrap vs @ C no wrap , P < @ ) and poststabilization temperatures ( @ C vs @ C , P < @ ) than nonwrap infants .
Result	For the secondary outcomes , there was a significant decrease in pulmonary hemorrhage ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the wrap group and a significant lower mean one minute Apgar score ( P = @ ) in the wrap group .
Result	The study was stopped early because continued enrollment would not result in the attainment of a significant difference in the primary outcome .
Conclusion	Application of occlusive wrap to very preterm infants immediately after birth results in greater mean body temperature but does not reduce mortality .

Background	Few trials have compared different approaches to cardiovascular disease prevention among Pacific Asian ( PA ) populations .
Background	The Cluster Randomized Usual Care versus Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-term-risk ( CRUCIAL ) trial demonstrated that a proactive multifactorial intervention ( PMI ) approach ( based on single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin ) resulted in a greater reduction in calculated Framingham @-year coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk compared with usual care ( UC ) among hypertensive patients with additional risk factors .

Method	Patients were randomised ( @:@:@ ) to IFN -@ a , @ g subcutaneously three times a week or once a week , or placebo three times a week for up to @ months .
Method	MRI scans were performed every @ months , or every @ months if the patient developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis .
Method	End points analysed included : number of combined unique active lesions per patient per scan ; numbers and volumes of new T@ , T@ hypointense and gadolinium-enhancing ( Gd + ) lesions per patient per scan ; and brain volume .
Result	@ patients were randomised ( intent-to-treat population : subcutaneous IFN -@ a three times a week , n = @ ; subcutaneous IFN -@ a once a week , n = @ ; placebo , n = @ ) .
Result	Combined unique active lesions were lower in patients treated with subcutaneous IFN -@ a versus placebo ( mean ( SD ) lesions per patient per scan : three times a week @ ( @ ) ; once a week @ ( @ ) ; placebo @ ( @ ) ; reduction versus placebo : three times a week @ % ; once a week @ % ; p < @ ) and with three times a week versus once a week ( @ % reduction ; p = @ ) .
Result	The mean numbers of new T@ , T@ hypointense and Gd + lesions were all significantly lower in the two active treatment arms compared with placebo ( p@ @ for three times a week or once a week ) and in the three times a week group compared with once a week ( p@ @ ) .
Conclusion	Both subcutaneous IFN -@ a @ g regimens improved MRI outcomes versus placebo , with the three times a week regimen having a more pronounced effect than once a week dosing .

Problem	Recent studies show that cerebral - amyloid ( A ) deposition is associated with blood pressure and measures of arterial stiffness in nondemented individuals .
Problem	To examine the association between measures of arterial stiffness and change in A deposition over time .
Method	Deposition of A was determined in a longitudinal observational study of aging by positron emission tomography using the Pittsburgh compound B twice @ years apart in @ nondemented individuals @ years and older .
Method	Arterial stiffness was measured with a noninvasive and automated waveform analyzer at the time closest to the second positron emission tomography scan .
Method	All measures were performed under standardized conditions .
Method	Pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) was measured in the central ( carotid-femoral and heart-femoral PWV ) , peripheral ( femoral-ankle PWV ) , and mixed ( brachial-ankle PWV ) vascular beds .
Method	The change in A deposition over @ years was calculated from the @ individuals with repeat A-positron emission tomography .
Result	The proportion of A-positive individuals increased from @ % at baseline to @ % at follow-up .
Result	Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher among A-positive participants at baseline and follow-up .
Result	Femoral-ankle PWV was only higher among A-positive participants at follow-up .
Result	Measures of central stiffness and blood pressure were not associated with A status at baseline or follow-up , but central stiffness was associated with a change in A deposition over time .
Result	Each standard deviation increase in central stiffness ( carotid-femoral PWV , P = @ ; heart-femoral PWV , P = @ ) was linked with increases in A deposition over @ years .
Conclusion	This study showed that A deposition increases with age in nondemented individuals and that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the progressive deposition of A in the brain , especially in this age group .
Conclusion	The association between A deposition changes over time and generalized arterial stiffness indicated a relationship between the severity of subclinical vascular disease and progressive cerebral A deposition .

Background	Avastin Biomarkers In lunG And @D Innovative anaLysis ( ABIGAIL ) , which is a phase II , open-label , randomized study , investigated correlations between biomarkers and best overall response to bevacizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy for patients with advanced/recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer .
Method	Patients received bevacizumab ( @ or @ mg/kg , @-weekly until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity ) plus carboplatin/gemcitabine or carboplatin/paclitaxel ( maximum six cycles ) .
Method	Plasma samples ( baseline/throughout treatment ) were analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) - A ( baseline only ) , VEGF receptors ( VEGFR-@ / VEGFR-@ ) , basic fibroblast growth factor , E-selectin , intercellular adhesion molecule-@ , and placental growth factor ( baseline only ) .
Method	Tumor samples ( primary specimen ) were analyzed for VEGF-A , VEGFR-@ / VEGFR-@ , neuropilin ( NRP ) , and CD@ .
Method	Response was evaluated at baseline and every @ weeks ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) .
Result	Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy plus @ mg/kg ( n = @ ) or @ mg/kg ( n = @ ) bevacizumab .
Result	For the primary analysis , none of the baseline plasma biomarkers correlated with best overall response .
Result	Exploratory analyses showed that low VEGF-A levels were associated with longer progression-free survival ( @ versus @ months ; hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence intervals , @ to @ ; p = @ ) and overall survival ( @ versus @ months ; hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) compared with these in high baseline plasma VEGF-A levels .
Result	No plasma biomarkers changed significantly over time .
Result	No significant correlations were observed between tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes .
Result	No new safety signals were observed .
Conclusion	Baseline and/or dynamic changes in plasma basic fibroblast growth factor , E-selectin , intercellular adhesion molecule-@ , placental growth factor , VEGFR-@ and VEGFR-@ , and tumor biomarkers did not correlate statistically with treatment outcomes for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy .
Conclusion	Only baseline plasma VEGF-A was significantly correlated with progression-free survival/overall survival .

Problem	We report active treatment group differences on response and remission rates and changes in anxiety severity at weeks @ and @ for the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study ( CAMS ) .
Method	CAMS youth ( N = @ ; @ % @ years of age ) with DSM-IV separation , generalized , or social anxiety disorder were randomized to @ weeks of cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , sertraline ( SRT ) , CBT+SRT ( COMB ) , or medication management/pill placebo ( PBO ) .
Method	Responders attended @ monthly booster sessions in their assigned treatment arm ; youth in COMB and SRT continued on their medication throughout this period .
Method	Efficacy of COMB , SRT , and CBT ( n = @ ) was assessed at @ and @ weeks postrandomization .
Method	Youth randomized to PBO ( n = @ ) were offered active CAMS treatment if nonresponsive at week @ or over follow-up and were not included here .
Method	Independent evaluators blind to study condition assessed anxiety severity , functioning , and treatment response .
Method	Concomitant treatments were allowed but monitored over follow-up .
Result	The majority ( > @ % ) of acute responders maintained positive response at both weeks @ and @ .
Result	Consistent with acute outcomes , COMB maintained advantage over CBT and SRT , which did not differ , on dimensional outcomes ; the @ treatments did not differ on most categorical outcomes over follow-up .
Result	Compared to COMB and CBT , youth in SRT obtained more concomitant psychosocial treatments , whereas those in SRT and CBT obtained more concomitant combined ( medication plus psychosocial ) treatment .
Conclusion	COMB maintained advantage over CBT and SRT on some measures over follow-up , whereas the @ monotherapies remained indistinguishable .
Conclusion	The observed convergence of COMB and monotherapy may be related to greater use of concomitant treatment during follow-up among youth receiving the monotherapies , although other explanations are possible .
Conclusion	Although outcomes were variable , most CAMS-treated youth experienced sustained treatment benefit .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registration information-Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders ( CAMS ) ; URL : http://clinicaltrials.gov .

Background	Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) from heart failure ( HF ) therapy are frequent ; however , techniques to identify at-risk patients are inadequate .
Background	Furthermore , the relationship between SAEs , quality of life ( QOL ) , and cardiac structure are unknown .
Result	@ symptomatic patients with systolic HF were followed for a mean of @ months .
Result	In this post hoc analysis , treatment-related SAEs included acute renal failure , dizziness , hypo/hyperkalemia , hypotension , and syncope .
Result	At @ year , @ treatment-related SAEs occurred .
Result	No difference in SAEs existed between the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) - guided arm and the standard of care arm ( P = @ ) .
Result	At baseline , patients who suffered SAEs were less likely to be receiving beta-blockers ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) and had worse functional class and lower chloride levels .
Result	Patients who experienced SAEs had less improvement in their Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire scores and had a trend toward reduced echocardiographic reverse remodeling over the follow-up period .
Result	Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to develop a risk score for SAE prediction ; patients in the highest risk quartile had the shortest time to first cardiovascular event ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	NT-proBNP-guided HF care is safe .
Conclusion	Experiencing treatment-related SAEs is associated with worse QOL and potentially reduced reverse remodeling .
Conclusion	A risk score to prospectively predict SAEs in aggressive HF management was developed .

Problem	Active immunotherapy is a promising antitumoral strategy ; however its use in combination with chemotherapy in dogs with large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) remains largely untested .
Problem	Heat shock proteins ( HSP ) bind the small peptides they chaperone ( HSPPC ) , allowing for immunization of the host against a large repertoire of tumor-associated antigens .
Problem	Hydroxylapatite vehicles HSPPCs and acts as an immunologic adjuvant .
Problem	The aim of this study was to show that an autologous vaccine with hydroxylapatite and tumor-derived HSPPCs is safe and therapeutically effective in dogs with DLBCL .
Method	Nineteen dogs with naturally occurring DLBCL were entered into a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded trial of HSPPCs-hydroxylapatite plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone .
Method	Endpoints included time to progression ( TTP ) , lymphoma-specific survival ( LSS ) , and incidence of toxicoses .
Result	Median first TTP after randomization to the vaccine arm was @ days versus @ days for the control arm ( P = @ ) .
Result	There was also a statistically significant difference in duration of second remission between the two groups ( P = @ ) .
Result	Median LSS was @ days for the vaccinated dogs versus @ days for the unvaccinated dogs ( P = @ ) .
Result	Six vaccinated dogs achieved molecular remission , as shown by clonal immunoglobulin H ( IgH ) rearrangement .
Result	Toxicoses were comparable between the two treatment arms .
Conclusion	The results of this trial demonstrate that the autologous vaccine tested here is safe and efficacious in prolonging TTP and LSS in dogs with DLBCL when used in combination with dose-intense chemotherapy .
Conclusion	On the basis of these results , additional evaluation of this novel therapeutic strategy is warranted in human DLBCL .

Result	Estimated glomerular filtration rate increased between baseline and follow-up in both groups ( @ and @ mL/min , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Compared with RC , an intervention to promote target-driven , intensive management of patients with type @ diabetes detected by screening was not associated with significant reductions in the frequency of microvascular events at @ years .

Background	Emotional eating in children has been related to the consumption of energy-dense foods and obesity , but the development of emotional eating in young children is poorly understood .
Problem	We evaluated whether emotional eating can be induced in @-@-y-old children in the laboratory and assessed whether parental use of overly controlling feeding practices at @-@ y of age predicts a greater subsequent tendency for children to eat under conditions of mild stress at ages @-@ y.
Method	Forty-one parent-child dyads were recruited to participate in this longitudinal study , which involved parents and children being observed consuming a standard lunch , completing questionnaire measures of parental feeding practices , participating in a research procedure to induce child emotion ( or a control procedure ) , and observing children 's consumption of snack foods .
Result	Children at ages @-@ y who were exposed to a mild emotional stressor consumed significantly more calories from snack foods in the absence of hunger than did children in a control group .
Result	Parents who reported the use of more food as a reward and restriction of food for health reasons with their children at ages @-@ y were more likely to have children who ate more under conditions of negative emotion at ages @-@ y.
Conclusion	Parents who overly control children 's food intake may unintentionally teach children to rely on palatable foods to cope with negative emotions .
Conclusion	Additional research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings for children 's food intake and weight outside of the laboratory setting .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Problem	To compare rates and severity of complications between infants undergoing cataract surgery with and without intraocular lens ( IOL ) implantation .
Method	Prospective randomized clinical trial .
Method	A total of @ infants were enrolled in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study , a randomized , multi-center ( @ ) clinical trial comparing the treatment of unilateral aphakia in patients under @ months of age with a primary IOL implant or contact lens .
Method	The rate , character , and severity of intraoperative complications , adverse events , and additional intraocular surgeries during the first @ postoperative years in the @ groups were examined .
Result	There were more patients with intraoperative complications ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , adverse events ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , and more additional intraocular surgeries ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) in the IOL group than in the contact lens group .
Result	However , the number of patients with adverse events in the contact lens group increased ( @ to @ ) in postoperative years @-@ compared to the first postoperative year , while it decreased ( @ to @ ) in years @-@ compared to the first postoperative year in the IOL group .
Result	If only one half of the patients in the contact lens ( aphakic ) group eventually undergo secondary IOL implantation , the number of additional intraocular surgeries in the @ groups will be approximately equal .
Conclusion	The increased rate of complications , adverse events , and additional intraocular surgeries associated with IOL implantation in infants < @ months of age militates toward leaving babies aphakic if it is considered likely that the family will be successful with contact lens correction .

Background	Most patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) report clinically significant sleep problems .
Background	Pre-treatment insomnia has been associated with poorer treatment outcomes in some antidepressant trials , leading to suggestions that combined treatment regimens may be more successful in this subgroup .
Background	This study investigated this question using data from the CO-MED trial .
Method	Adult outpatients with chronic and/or recurrent MDD were randomly assigned in @:@:@ ratio to @ weeks of single-blind , placebo-controlled antidepressant treatment with ( @ ) escitalopram + placebo , ( @ ) bupropion-sustained-release + escitalopram , or ( @ ) venlafaxine-extended-release + mirtazapine .
Method	We compared baseline characteristics , tolerability , and treatment outcomes at @ and @ weeks for patients with and without pre-treatment insomnia .
Result	Of the @ evaluable patients , the majority ( @ % ) reported significant pre-treatment insomnia .
Result	Those with pre-treatment insomnia were more likely to be female ( @ % vs. @ % ) and African-American ( @ % vs. @ % ) .
Result	Those with pre-treatment insomnia symptoms reported higher rates of concurrent anxiety disorders , lower rates of alcohol and substance use disorders , and greater impairment in psychosocial functioning .
Result	The two groups did not differ in either tolerability or treatment outcomes among the three antidepressant treatments .
Conclusion	Insomnia symptoms , while common in patients with chronic/recurrent MDD were not predictive of response , remission , or tolerability with either single or combined antidepressant medications .

Background	Dual orexin receptor antagonists ( DORAs ) enable initiation and maintenance of sleep in patients with primary insomnia .
Background	Blockade of the orexin system has shown reduction of drug-seeking behavior in animal studies , supporting the role of orexin antagonism as a novel approach for treating substance abuse .
Background	Since hypnotics are traditionally associated with misuse , a lack of abuse liability of DORAs would offer significant benefits over current therapies for sleep disorders .
Method	In this randomized , crossover , proof-of-concept study , single oral doses of the DORA almorexant ( @ , @ , and @,@ mg ) were administered to healthy subjects with previous non-therapeutic experience with central nervous system depressants and were compared with placebo and single oral doses of zolpidem ( @ and @ mg ) , a benzodiazepine-like drug .
Method	Subjective measures of abuse potential ( visual analog scales -LSB- VAS -RSB- , Addiction Research Center Inventory , and Subjective Drug Value ) and objective measures ( divided attention -LSB- DA -RSB- ) were evaluated over @ h post-dose in @ evaluable subjects .
Result	Drug Liking VAS peak effect ( E max ; primary endpoint ) was significantly higher for all doses of almorexant and zolpidem compared with placebo ( p < @ ) .
Result	Almorexant @ mg showed significantly less ` Drug Liking ' than both zolpidem doses ( p < @ ) , and almorexant @ mg had smaller effects than zolpidem @ mg ( p < @ ) , while almorexant @,@ mg was not different from either zolpidem dose .
Result	Results were similar for other subjective measures , although almorexant generally showed smaller negative and perceptual effects compared with zolpidem .
Result	Almorexant also showed less cognitive impairment compared with zolpidem on most DA endpoints .
Conclusion	This study in humans investigating single doses of almorexant is the first to explore and show abuse liability of a DORA , a class of compounds that is not only promising for the treatment of sleep disorders , but also of addiction .

Problem	Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is an immanent risk of cranial surgery with dural opening .
Problem	Recognizing the risk factors for this complication and improving the technique of dural closure may reduce the associated morbidity and its surgical burden .
Problem	The aim of this paper was to investigate whether the addition of TachoSil on top of the dural suture reduces postoperative CSF leakage compared with dural suturing alone and to assess the frequency and risk factors for dural leakage and potentially related complications after elective craniotomy .
Method	The authors conducted a prospective , randomized , double-blinded single-center trial in patients undergoing elective craniotomy with dural opening .
Method	They compared their standard dural closure by running suture alone ( with the use of a dural patch if needed ) to the same closure with the addition of TachoSil on top of the suture .
Method	The primary end point was the incidence of CSF leakage , defined as CSF collection or any open CSF fistula within @ days .
Method	Secondary end points were the incidence of infection , surgical revision , and length of stay in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) or intermediate care ( IMC ) unit .
Method	The site of craniotomy , a history of diabetes mellitus , a diagnosis of meningioma , the intraoperative need of a suturable dural substitute , and blood parameters were assessed as potential risk factors for CSF leakage .
Result	The authors enrolled @ patients , of whom @ were included in the analysis .
Result	Cerebrospinal fluid leakage , mostly self-limiting subgaleal collections , occurred in @ % of patients .
Result	Invasive treatment was performed in @ patients ( @ % ) ( subgaleal puncture in @ , lumbar drainage in @ , and surgical revision in @ patient ) .
Result	Diabetes mellitus , a higher preoperative level of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and the intraoperative need for a dural patch were positively associated with the occurrence of the primary end point ( p = @ , @ , and @ , respectively ) .
Result	Cerebrospinal fluid leakage ( @ % vs @ % , OR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) and infection ( OR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) occurred less frequently in the study group than in the control group .
Result	TachoSil significantly reduced the probability of staying in the IMC unit for @ day or longer ( OR @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	Postoperative epidural hematoma and empyema occurred in the control group but not in the study group .
Conclusion	Dural leakage after elective craniotomy/durotomy occurs more frequently in association with diabetes mellitus , elevated preoperative CRP levels , and the intraoperative need of a dural patch .
Conclusion	This randomized controlled trial showed no statistically significant reduction of postoperative CSF leakage and surgical site infections upon addition of TachoSil on the dural suture , but there was a significant reduction in the length of stay in the IMC unit .
Conclusion	Dural augmentation with TachoSil was safe and not related to adverse events .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registration no .
Conclusion	NCT@ ( http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov ) .

Background	Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is followed by significant inflammation .
Background	Protoporphyrin ( Pp ) IX is still formed in the skin after PDT and patients are sensitive to daylight @-@ h after treatment .
Background	Exposure to daylight after PDT may therefore increase inflammation .
Problem	To investigate whether protection with inorganic sunscreen , foundation or light-blocking plaster after PDT can reduce inflammation caused by daylight-activated PpIX .
Method	On the right arm of @ subjects with sun-damaged skin , four identical squares ( @ @ cm ) were given conventional PDT treatment .
Method	Immediately after red-light illumination the squares were either left unprotected or protected by inorganic sunscreen -LSB- sun protection factor ( SPF ) @ -RSB- , foundation ( SPF@ ) or light-blocking plaster .
Method	The skin was then illuminated with artificial daylight for @ h and afterwards covered for @ h. Fluorescence and erythema ( inflammation ) were measured with a fluorescence camera and a reflectance meter .
Result	PpIX was significantly reduced after artificial daylight illumination ( P < @ ) , except on the square protected with light-blocking silver plaster , where it had increased ( P = @ ) .
Result	The increased erythema @ h after treatment was reduced by @ % with the sunscreen ( P = @ ) , by @ % with the foundation ( P = @ ) and by @ % with the silver plaster ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Artificial daylight exposure after conventional PDT increases skin erythema .
Conclusion	Light-blocking plaster gives more effective protection against post-PDT daylight exposure than inorganic sunscreen and foundation .
Conclusion	In practice such full protection can be achieved by use of sun-blocking clothes or daylight avoidance for @ h.

Background	Clomiphene is the current first-line infertility treatment in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome , but aromatase inhibitors , including letrozole , might result in better pregnancy outcomes .
Method	In this double-blind , multicenter trial , we randomly assigned @ women , in a @:@ ratio , to receive letrozole or clomiphene for up to five treatment cycles , with visits to determine ovulation and pregnancy , followed by tracking of pregnancies .
Method	The polycystic ovary syndrome was defined according to modified Rotterdam criteria ( anovulation with either hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries ) .
Method	Participants were @ to @ years of age , had at least one patent fallopian tube and a normal uterine cavity , and had a male partner with a sperm concentration of at least @ million per milliliter ; the women and their partners agreed to have regular intercourse with the intent of conception during the study .
Method	The primary outcome was live birth during the treatment period .
Result	Women who received letrozole had more cumulative live births than those who received clomiphene ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ; rate ratio for live birth , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ) without significant differences in overall congenital anomalies , though there were four major congenital anomalies in the letrozole group versus one in the clomiphene group ( P = @ ) .
Result	The cumulative ovulation rate was higher with letrozole than with clomiphene ( @ of @ treatment cycles -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ of @ treatment cycles -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P < @ ) .
Result	There were no significant between-group differences in pregnancy loss ( @ of @ pregnancies in the letrozole group -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ of @ pregnancies in the clomiphene group -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) or twin pregnancy ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
Result	Clomiphene was associated with a higher incidence of hot flushes , and letrozole was associated with higher incidences of fatigue and dizziness .
Result	Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups .
Conclusion	As compared with clomiphene , letrozole was associated with higher live-birth and ovulation rates among infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome .
Conclusion	( Funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and others ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy developed for patients living with a life-limiting illness .
Problem	To determine the influence of dignity therapy on depression and anxiety in inpatients with a terminal illness and experiencing a high level of distress in a palliative care unit .
Method	A nonblinded phase II randomized controlled trial of @ patients who were randomly assigned to one of two groups : intervention group ( dignity therapy + standard palliative care -LSB- SPC -RSB- ) or control group ( SPC alone ) .
Method	The main outcomes were depression and anxiety scores , as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , and assessed at baseline ( T@ ) , day @ ( T@ ) , day @ ( T@ ) , and day @ ( T@ ) of follow-up .
Method	This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN@ .

Result	Dignity therapy was similarly associated with a decrease in anxiety scores ( median , @ % CI : -@ , -@ to -@ , p < @ ; -@ , -@ to -@ , p = @ ; -@ , -@ to -@ , p = @ , for T@ , T@ , and T@ , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Dignity therapy resulted in a beneficial effect on depression and anxiety symptoms in end-of-life care .
Conclusion	The therapeutic benefit of dignity therapy was sustained over a @-day period .
Conclusion	Having established its efficacy , future trials of dignity therapy may now begin , comparing it with other psychotherapeutic approaches within the context of terminal illness .

Background	Levomilnacipran extended-release ( ER ) is an FDA-approved serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) for treating major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .
Background	SF-@v@ Health Survey outcomes from a Phase III , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study ( NCT@ ) were evaluated .
Method	Prospective and post hoc analyses of SF-@ Mental and Physical Component Summaries ( MCS , PCS ) , and individual domains compared pooled levomilnacipran ER doses ( @ , @ , @ mg/day ) with placebo .
Method	Patients ( @-@ years ) had MDD , depressive episode @ weeks , and Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale total score @ .
Method	SF-@ score changes from baseline to Week @ were analyzed using ANCOVA and the observed cases approach ( Intent-to-Treat -LSB- ITT -RSB- Population ) .
Method	Minimally important differences ( MID ) evaluated clinical relevance .
Result	Baseline MCS scores reflected marked mental deficits in the ITT Population ( levomilnacipran ER = @ ; placebo = @ ) .
Result	MCS change at Week @ was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER than placebo ( LSMD -LSB- SE -RSB- = @ -LSB- @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) ; MID exceeded the @-point threshold .
Result	Baseline PCS scores suggested minimal physical deficits ; no between-group difference at Week @ was noted .
Result	LSMD was nominally statistically significant ( P < @ ) for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in @ domains ( General Health -LSB- @ ; P = @ -RSB- , Vitality -LSB- @ ; P = @ -RSB- , Social Functioning -LSB- @ ; P = @ -RSB- , Role-Emotional -LSB- @ ; P = @ -RSB- , Mental Health -LSB- @ ; P = @ -RSB- ) ; changes in Vitality , Social Functioning , and Mental Health exceeded MID .
Conclusion	The trial was limited by short duration ; analyses were post hoc and adjustments were not made for multiplicity .
Conclusion	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement on the MCS and several individual domains suggest overall and dimensional improvement in health-related functioning for patients with MDD treated with levomilnacipran ER versus placebo .

Background	Regular exercise and dietary practices have been shown to affect the health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) and survival of breast cancer patients .
Problem	The current study aimed to investigate whether the WSEDI was a feasible and primarily effective method for promoting exercise and dietary behaviours for breast cancer patients .
Method	A @-week randomized , controlled trial .
Method	Oncology outpatient treatment clinics at @ university hospitals and @ National Cancer Center in South Korea .
Method	Fifty-nine breast cancer patients who had received curative surgery and completed primary cancer treatment within @ months prior to the study and who had been diagnosed with stage @-III cancers within @ years prior to the study were recruited .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group , which used a Web-based self-management exercise and diet intervention program incorporating transtheoretical model ( TTM ) - based strategies ( n = @ ) , or to the control group , which used a @-page educational booklet on exercise and diet ( n = @ ) .
Method	The intervention efficacy was measured at the baseline and @ weeks via a Web-based survey that addressed the promotion of exercise and consumption of @ servings of fruits and vegetables ( F&V ) per day , dietary quality , HRQOL , anxiety , depression , fatigue , motivational readiness , and self-efficacy .
Result	The proportion of subjects who performed at least moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least @ min per week ; ate @ servings of F&V per day ; and had overall improvements in dietary quality , physical functioning and appetite loss ( HRQOL ) , fatigue , and motivational readiness was greater in the intervention group than in the control group .
Result	The self-efficacy with respect to exercise and F&V consumption was greater in the intervention group than in the control group .
Result	A Web-based program that targets changes in exercise and dietary behaviours might be effective for breast cancer survivors if the TTM theory has been used to inform the program strategy , although further research with a larger sample size is required to enable definitive conclusions .

Problem	Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) is a common , costly societal problem .
Problem	Interventions designed to reduce IPV recidivism have had limited success but primary prevention efforts are likely to be more effective in reducing the occurrence of IPV .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a computer-based preventive intervention ( ePREP ) on IPV in a sample of married , community couples .
Method	We employed a randomized clinical trial design comparing ePREP to an active placebo control group .
Method	Using a community sample of @ married couples ( @ % Black , @ % Asian , @ % White , @ % Latino , @ % Mixed/biracial ) who had been married , on average , @ years , we examined the impact ePREP on IPV as measured by self and partner reports of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale .
Method	We assessed couples at baseline , six-weeks post-baseline , and one-year post-baseline .
Method	We used the Actor Partner Interdependence Model with treatment effects to analyze the obtained dyadic data .
Result	We found that ePREP reduced physical and psychological aggression among married couples ( on average across informants , a @ % reduction in expected counts of physical aggression , and a @ standard deviation reduction in psychological aggression ) and that these gains were maintained at a @-year follow-up assessment .
Conclusion	Interventions that can be delivered widely and at a low-cost will increase the likelihood of reaching those who will benefit most from receiving them .
Conclusion	Implications for implementing flexible interventions and changing our approach to treatment delivery are discussed .

Background	Whole body cryotherapy ( WBC ) is the therapeutic application of extreme cold air for a short duration .
Background	Minimal evidence is available for determining optimal exposure time .
Problem	To explore whether the length of WBC exposure induces differential changes in inflammatory markers , tissue oxygenation , skin and core temperature , thermal sensation and comfort .
Method	This study was a randomised cross over design with participants acting as their own control .
Method	Fourteen male professional first team super league rugby players were exposed to @ , @ , and @ minutes of WBC at -@ C. Testing took place the day after a competitive league fixture , each exposure separated by seven days .
Result	No significant changes were found in the inflammatory cytokine interleukin six .
Result	Significant reductions ( p < @ ) in deoxyhaemoglobin for gastrocnemius and vastus lateralis were found .
Result	In vastus lateralis significant reductions ( p < @ ) in oxyhaemoglobin and tissue oxygenation index ( p < @ ) were demonstrated .
Result	Significant reductions ( p < @ ) in skin temperature were recorded .
Result	No significant changes were recorded in core temperature .
Result	Significant reductions ( p < @ ) in thermal sensation and comfort were recorded .
Conclusion	Three brief exposures to WBC separated by @ week are not sufficient to induce physiological changes in IL-@ or core temperature .
Conclusion	There are however significant changes in tissue oxyhaemoglobin , deoxyhaemoglobin , tissue oxygenation index , skin temperature and thermal sensation .
Conclusion	We conclude that a @ minute WBC exposure was the optimum exposure length at temperatures of -@ C and could be applied as the basis for future studies .

Problem	To compare the kinematics of lower limb joints between individuals with and without chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) during cross-turn and - cutting movements .
Method	Cross-sectional study .
Method	Motion analysis laboratory .
Method	Twelve subjects with CAI and twelve healthy controls .
Method	Hip flexion , adduction , and internal rotation , knee flexion , and ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles were calculated in the @ms before initial ground contact and from initial ground contact to toe-off ( stance phase ) in a cross-turn movement during gait and a cross-cutting movement from a forward jump , and compared across the two groups .
Result	In the cross-cutting movement , the CAI group exhibited greater hip and knee flexion than the control group during the stance phase , and more hip abduction during the period before initial contact and the stance phase .
Result	In the cross-turn movement the joint kinematics were similar in the two groups .
Conclusion	CAI subjects exhibited an altered pattern of the proximal joint kinematics during a cross-cutting movement .
Conclusion	It is important for clinicians to assess the function of the hip and knee as well as the ankle , and to incorporate coordination training for the entire lower limb into rehabilitation after lateral ankle sprains .

Problem	To observe the effect of medicinal-cake-separated moxibustion combined with acupuncture on back-leg activities and plasma substance P ( SP ) levels in patients with lumbar disc herniation , so as to reveal its mechanism underlying pain relief .
Method	A total of @ patients with lumbar disc herniation were randomly divided into control group ( n = @ ) and treatment group ( n = @ ) according to a random digits table .

Background	Risk factors have been proposed for running injuries including ( a ) reduced muscular strength , ( b ) excessive joint movements and ( c ) excessive joint moments in the frontal and transverse planes .
Background	To date , many running injury prevention programs have focused on a `` top down '' approach to strengthen the hip musculature in the attempt to reduce movements and moments at the hip , knee , and/or ankle joints .
Background	However , running mechanics did not change when hip muscle strength increased .
Background	It could be speculated that emphasis should be placed on increasing the strength of the ankle joint for a `` ground up '' approach .
Background	Strengthening of the large and small muscles crossing the ankle joint is assumed to change the force distribution for these muscles and to increase the use of smaller muscles .
Background	This would be associated with a reduction of joint and insertion forces , which could have a beneficial effect on injury prevention .
Background	However , training of the ankle joint as an injury prevention strategy has not been studied .
Background	Ankle strengthening techniques include isolated strengthening or movement-related strengthening such as functional balance training .
Background	There is little knowledge about the efficacy of such training programs on strength alteration , gait or injury reduction .
Method	Novice runners will be randomly assigned to one of three groups : an isolated ankle strengthening group ( strength , n = @ ) , a functional balance training group ( balance , n = @ ) or an activity-matched control group ( control , n = @ ) .
Method	Isokinetic strength will be measured using a Biodex System @ dynamometer .
Method	Running kinematics and kinetics will be assessed using @D motion analysis and a force platform .
Method	Postural control will be assessed by quantifying the magnitude and temporal structure of the center of pressure trace during single leg stance on a force platform .
Method	The change pre - and post-training in isokinetic strength , running mechanics , and postural control variables will be compared following the interventions .
Method	Injuries rates will be compared between groups over @months .
Conclusion	Avoiding injury will allow individuals to enjoy the benefits of participating in aerobic activities and reduce the healthcare costs associated with running injuries .

Problem	To investigate the effectiveness of rectally administered indomethacin in the prophylaxis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia in a multicentre study .
Method	A prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled multicentre study in five endoscopic units was conducted on @ patients randomised to receive a suppository containing @ mg indomethacin , or an inert placebo , @-@ min before ERCP .
Method	Post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia were evaluated @ h following the procedure on the basis of clinical signs and laboratory parameters , and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings if required .
Result	Twenty-one patients were excluded because of incompleteness of their data or because of protocol violation .
Result	The results of @ investigations were evaluated : @ in the indomethacin group and @ in the placebo group .
Result	The distributions of the risk factors in the two groups did not differ significantly .
Result	Pancreatitis developed in @ patients ( @ % ) : it was mild in @ ( @ % ) and severe in eight ( @ % ) cases .
Result	Hyperamylaesemia occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) .
Result	There was no significant difference between the indomethacin and placebo groups in the incidence of either post-ERCP pancreatitis ( @ % vs @ % ) or hyperamylasaemia ( @ % vs @ % ) .
Result	Similarly , subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups .
Conclusion	@ mg rectal indomethacin administered before ERCP did not prove effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis .

Background	Limited data describe patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) of localised oesophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) .
Background	The phase @/@ SCOPE-@ trial assessed the effectiveness of CRTcetuximab .
Background	The trial for the first time provided an opportunity to describe PROs from a multi-centre group of patients treated with CRT that are presented here .
Method	Patients undergoing CRTcetuximab within the SCOPE-@ trial ( @ patients from @ UK centres ) completed generic - , disease - and treatment-specific health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) questionnaires ( EORTC QLQ-C@ , QLQ-OES@ , Dermatology Life-Quality Index ( DLQI ) ) at baseline and at @ , @ , @ , @ and @ weeks .
Method	Mean EORTC functional scale scores ( > @ point change significant ) , DLQI scores ( > @ point change significant ) and proportions of patients ( > @ % significant ) with ` minimal ' or ` severe ' symptoms are presented .
Result	Questionnaire response rates were good .
Result	At baseline , EORTC functional scores were high ( > @ % ) and few symptoms were reported except for severe problems with fatigue , insomnia and eating-related symptoms ( e.g. , appetite loss , dysphagia , dry mouth ) in both groups ( > @ % ) .
Result	Functional aspects of health deteriorated and symptoms increased with treatment and by week @ global quality of life , physical , role and social function significantly deteriorated and more problems with fatigue , dyspnoea , appetite loss and trouble with taste were reported .
Result	Recovery occurred by @ months ( except severe fatigue and insomnia in > @ % of patients ) and maintained at follow-up with no differences between groups .

Result	Pain scores were significantly higher in group @ ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Our study results suggest that nasal pack use does not affect surgical success and complication rates in septoplasty .
Conclusion	Pack-free septoplasty with the transseptal suture technique is an effective method in the treatment of septal deviation .

Problem	Heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD ) are common in patients with permanent pacemakers , but whether right ventricular ( RV ) pacing is contributory or merely a bystander in patients with more severe cardiac disease is controversial .
Problem	The aim of the present study was to determine whether reprogramming of existing pacemakers to reduce RV pacing is safe and leads to improvements in cardiac function .
Method	This was a prospective service evaluation of the effects of optimising pacemaker programming to avoid RV pacing in @ consecutive attendees of a teaching hospital pacemaker clinic without complete heart block .
Method	The main outcome measures were left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro-BNP ) levels , quality of life and cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and after @ months .
Result	At @ months , the protocol reduced absolute RV pacing by a mean of @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) ( p < @ from baseline ) and resulted in a mean absolute improvement in LVEF of @ % ( @ % to @ % ) ( p < @ from baseline ) but no reduction in exercise capacity , NT-pro-BNP or quality of life .
Result	There was a relationship between the magnitude of change in EF and the reduction in RV pacing ( p = @ ) and changes in NT-pro-BNP seemed to relate to change in RV pacing ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Programming standard pacemakers to avoid RV pacing is safe , does not adversely affect patients ' symptoms or quality of life and is associated with improved LV function , related to the reductions in RV pacing percentage .

Background	In the clinic setting both fasting levels of glucose and the area under the curve ( AUC ) of glucose , by determination of HbA@c levels , are used for risk assessments , in type @ diabetes ( NIDDM ) .
Background	However little is known about postprandial levels , and hence AUC , regarding other traditional risk factors such as insulin and blood-lipids and how this is affected by different diets .
Problem	To study postprandial effects of three diets , during a single day , in NIDDM .
Method	A low-fat diet ( @-@ energy - % from carbohydrates ) , and a low-carbohydrate diet ( @-@ energy - % from carbohydrates ) was compared with a Mediterranean-style diet ( black coffee for breakfast and the same total-caloric intake as the other two diets for lunch with red wine , @-@ energy - % from carbohydrates ) in a randomized cross-over design .
Method	Total-caloric intake/test-day at the clinic from food was @-@ kCal in men and @-@ kCal in women .
Method	The test meals were consumed at a diabetes ward under supervision .
Result	Twenty-one participants were recruited and @ completed the studies .
Result	The low-carbohydrate diet induced lower insulin and glucose excursions compared with the low-fat diet ( p < @ for both AUC ) .
Result	The insulin-response following the single Mediterranean-style lunch-meal was more pronounced than during the low-fat diet lunch ( insulin increase-ratio of the low-fat diet : @ @ , of Mediterranean-style diet : @ @ , p = @ ) while postprandial glucose levels were similar .
Result	The increase-ratio of insulin correlated with the elevation of the incretin glucose-dependent insulinotropic-polypeptide following the Mediterranean-style diet lunch ( Spearman , r = @ , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The large Mediterranean-style lunch-meal induced similar postprandial glucose-elevations as the low-fat meal despite almost double amount of calories due to a pronounced insulin-increase .
Conclusion	This suggests that accumulation of caloric intake from breakfast and lunch to a single large Mediterranean style lunch-meal in NIDDM might be advantageous from a metabolic perspective .

Background	Allergic rhinitis is a chronic illness , affecting @ to @ % of the worldwide population .
Background	Chinese herbal medicines , the treatment of allergic rhinitis , adopted thousands of years in ancient China , has recently raised much attention among researchers globally .
Background	This study evaluates the effects of two Chinese herbal formulae -LSB- Cure-allergic-rhinitis Syrup ( CS ) and Yu-ping-feng San ( YS ) -RSB- in treating undergraduate nursing students with allergic rhinitis over a @-month follow-up , when compared to a placebo control group .
Method	A double-blind , randomised controlled trial with repeated-measures , three-parallel-groups design was conducted in a random sample of @ participants recruited from one university in Hong Kong .
Method	After baseline measurements , participants were randomly assigned to CS , YS , or placebo groups ( n = @ per group ) .
Method	The main outcomes , including symptom severity , quality of life , and body constitution , were measured with self-administered questionnaires at baseline and immediately , @ and @ months after the @-week interventions .
Result	@ participants completed the trial , with @ ( @ % ) drop-outs .
Result	The results of Generalised Estimating Equations test followed by pairwise contrasts tests indicated that the participants who received CS showed significantly greater reduction of symptoms ( mean difference of CS vs. placebo = @-@ @ , P < @ ) and improvements in quality of life ( mean difference of CS vs. placebo = @-@ @ , P < @ ) , and body constitution in ` Qi-deficiency ' , ` Yang-deficiency ' , and ` Inherited Special ' ( mean difference of CS vs. placebo = @-@ @ , @-@ @ , and @-@ @ , P = @ - < @ , @-@ @ , and @ - < @ , accordingly , at three post-tests ) .
Result	The participants who received YS also indicated significant greater improvements in symptom severity , quality of life , and a few patterns of body constitution when compared to the placebo group .
Result	However , its effects were lesser in strength ( i.e. , smaller effect sizes ) , varieties of symptoms , and body constitution and sustainability over the @ months .
Conclusion	The herbal formula CS was found effective to reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life in young adults ( nursing students ) with allergic rhinitis in ` Yang - and/or Qi-deficiency ' body constitution .
Conclusion	Further controlled trials of its effects in Chinese and/or Asians with allergic rhinitis in terms of socio-demographic , ethnic and illness characteristics and a longer-term follow-up are recommended .

Background	While physical exercise as adjunctive treatment for major depression has received considerable attention in recent years , the evidence is conflicting .
Background	This study evaluates the effects of two different add-on treatments : exercise and basic body awareness therapy .
Method	Randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups and one control , including @ adults on antidepressant medication , who fulfilled criteria for current major depression as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview .
Method	Interventions ( @ weeks ) were aerobic exercise or basic body awareness therapy ( BBAT ) , compared to a single consultation with advice on physical activity .
Method	Primary outcome was depression severity , rated by a blinded assessor using the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale ( MADRS ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes were global function , cardiovascular fitness , self-rated depression , anxiety and body awareness .
Result	Improvements in MADRS score ( mean change = -@ , @ % CI ( -@ to -@ ) , p = @ ) and cardiovascular fitness ( mean change = @ ml oxygen/kg/min , @ % CI ( @ to @ ) , p = @ ) were observed in the exercise group .
Result	Per-protocol analysis confirmed the effects of exercise , and indicated that BBAT has an effect on self-rated depression .
Conclusion	The small sample size and the challenge of missing data .
Conclusion	Participants positive expectations regarding the exercise intervention need to be considered .
Conclusion	Exercise in a physical therapy setting seems to have effect on depression severity and fitness , in major depression .
Conclusion	Our findings suggest that physical therapy can be a viable clinical strategy to inspire and guide persons with major depression to exercise .
Conclusion	More research is needed to clarify the effects of basic body awareness therapy .

Background	The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) respiratory infection in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) has increased dramatically over the last decade , and is now affecting approximately @ % of patients .
Background	Epidemiologic evidence suggests that persistent infection with MRSA results in an increased rate of decline in FEV@ and shortened survival .
Background	Currently , there are no conclusive studies demonstrating an effective and safe treatment protocol for persistent MRSA respiratory infection in CF.
Method	The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a @-day course of vancomycin for inhalation in combination with oral antibiotics in eliminating MRSA from the respiratory tract of individuals with CF and persistent MRSA infection .
Method	This is a two-center , randomized , double-blind , comparator-controlled , parallel-group study with @:@ assignment to either vancomycin for inhalation ( @mg twice a day ) or taste-matched placebo for @days in individuals with cystic fibrosis .
Method	In addition , both groups will receive oral rifampin , a second oral antibiotic - trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( TMP/SMX ) or doxycycline , protocol determined - mupirocin intranasal cream , and chlorhexidine body washes .
Method	Forty patients with persistent respiratory tract MRSA infection will be enrolled : @ will be randomized to vancomycin for inhalation and @ to a taste-matched placebo .
Method	The primary outcome will be the presence of MRSA in sputum respiratory tract cultures @month after the conclusion of treatment .
Method	Secondary outcomes include the efficacy of the intervention on : FEV@ % predicted , patient reported outcomes , pulmonary exacerbations , and MRSA colony-forming units found in respiratory tract sample culture .
Conclusion	Results of this study will provide guidance to clinicians regarding the safety and effectiveness of a targeted eradication strategy for persistent MRSA infection in CF.

Background	This study compares the long-term results of pneumatic dilatations versus laparoscopic myotomy using treatment failure as the primary outcome .
Background	The frequency and degree of dysphagia , the effects on quality of life ( QoL ) , and health economy were also examined .
Method	Fifty-three patients with achalasia were randomized to laparoscopic myotomy with a posterior partial fundoplication -LSB- laparoscopic myotomy ( LM ) n = @ -RSB- or repetitive pneumatic dilatation -LSB- pneumatic dilatation ( PD ) n = @ -RSB- .
Method	The median observation period was @ months ( range @-@ ) .
Result	At the minimal follow-up of @ years , ten patients ( @ % ) in the dilatation group and two patients ( @ % ) in the myotomy group , including two patients lost to follow-up ( one in each arm ) , were classified as failures ( p = @ ) .
Result	The cumulative incidence of treatment failures was analyzed by survival statistics .
Result	Taking the entire follow-up period into account , a significant difference was observed in favor of the LM strategy ( p = @ ) .
Result	Although both treatments resulted in significant improvements in dysphagia scores , LM was significantly favored over PD after @ and @ years , but not after @ years .
Result	Health-related QoL assessed by the personal general well being score was higher in the LM group after @ years , but the difference was not fully statistically significant at @ years .
Result	Direct medical costs during the entire follow-up period were in median $ @,@ for LM as compared to $ @,@ for PD ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical study shows that LM is superior to repetitive PD treatment of newly diagnosed achalasia , albeit that this surgical strategy is burdened by high initial direct medical costs .
Conclusion	www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT @ .

Background	We have found that hydrogen ( dihydrogen -LSB- H@ -RSB- ) decreases plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels and improves high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) function in patients with potential metabolic syndrome in a before-after self-controlled study .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to further characterize the effects of H@-rich water ( @ L/day ) on the content , composition , and biological activities of plasma lipoproteins on patients with hypercholesterolemia and their underlying mechanisms in a double-blinded , randomized , and placebo-controlled trial .
Method	This was a case-control study .
Method	The setting was the Zhoudian community , Tai'an , China .
Method	A total of @ patients with untreated isolated hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to either drinking H@-rich water ( n = @ ) or placebo water ( n = @ ) for @ weeks .
Result	HDL isolated from the H@ group showed an increased ability to promote the ATP-binding cassette transporter A@-mediated cholesterol efflux ex vivo .
Result	Plasma pre -- HDL levels were up-regulated although there were no changes in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels .
Result	Moreover , other HDL functions , assessed in protection against LDL oxidation , inhibition of oxidized-LDL-induced inflammation , and protection of endothelial cells from oxidized-LDL-induced apoptosis , were all significantly improved by H@ treatment .
Result	In addition , H@ treatment increased the effective rate in down-regulating plasma levels of total cholesterol ( @ % vs @ % ) and LDL cholesterol ( @ % vs @ % ) .
Result	Western blot analysis revealed a marked decrease in apolipoprotein B@ and an increase in apolipoprotein M in plasma of the H@ group .
Result	Finally H@ treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of several inflammatory and oxidative stress indicators in whole plasma and HDL particles .
Conclusion	H@ activates ATP-binding cassette transporter A@-dependent efflux , enhances HDL antiatherosclerotic functions , and has beneficial lipid-lowering effects .
Conclusion	The present findings highlight the potential role of H@ in the regression of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis .

Problem	We evaluated the efficacy and safety of an early invasive strategy post-fibrinolysis in relation to glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa inhibitor use .
Method	The Trial of Routine Angioplasty and Stenting after Fibrinolysis to Enhance Reperfusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction ( TRANSFER-AMI ) randomised @ ST elevation myocardial infarction patients to an early invasive strategy or standard therapy post-fibrinolysis .
Method	The primary end point was the composite of death , reinfarction , recurrent ischaemia , new or worsening heart failure , or cardiogenic shock at @ days .
Method	In this pre-specified analysis , we examined efficacy and safety outcomes of an early invasive strategy after stratification by GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use , which was permitted during percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) at the discretion of the treating physician .
Result	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) received GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors .
Result	There was significant heterogeneity ( p < @ ) in the efficacy of an early invasive strategy compared to standard therapy , between the strata with GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use ( primary end point @ % vs @ % respectively , p < @ ) and without GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use ( primary end point @ % vs @ % respectively , p = @ ) .
Result	Patients who received GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors had lower Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events ( GRACE ) risk scores compared to those without GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use ( median @ vs @ , p < @ ) .
Result	After adjusting for the interaction between GRACE risk score and treatment assignment , the heterogeneity in the efficacy of an early invasive strategy with respect to GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use was no longer significant ( p interaction = @ ) .
Conclusion	The apparent difference in the efficacy of an early invasive strategy between GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor strata likely reflects an association between GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use and baseline risk .
Conclusion	GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor use during PCI at the discretion of the treating physician does not appear to modulate the efficacy of an early invasive strategy post-fibrinolysis .

Problem	To observe the sedative and analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine ( Dex ) and its influence on respiration and blood pressure , evaluate electrophysiological monitoring and explore the optimal dose of Dex for brain nuclei lesion in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients .
Method	Approved by hospital ethics committee , @ PD patients undergoing brain nuclei lesion ablation were randomly allocated into @ groups ( n = @ each ) .

Problem	This study examined the potential emotional sequelae following self-reported mild head injury ( MHI ; e.g. ` altered state of consciousness ' -LSB- ASC -RSB- ) in university students with a particular focus on arousal status and responsivity to experimental manipulation of arousal .
Method	A quasi-experimental design ( n = @ ) was used to examine arousal status ( self-reported and physiological indices ) and response to manipulated arousal ( i.e. induced psychosocial stress/activation ; reduced activation/relaxation ) between persons who acknowledged prior MHI and persons with no-MHI .
Result	University students who self-reported MHI were physiologically under-aroused and less responsive to stressors ( both laboratory and environmental ) compared to their no-MHI cohort .
Result	Those with reported loss of consciousness demonstrated the most attenuated emotional arousal responses ( i.e. flattened electrodermal responsivity ) relative to those with only a reported ASC , followed by those with no-MHI .
Conclusion	The under-arousal in traumatic brain injury has been hypothesized to be associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex disruption .
Conclusion	This under-arousal may be mirrored in persons who self-report experiencing subtle head trauma .
Conclusion	Students who reported MHI may be less able to physiologically respond and/or cognitively appraise stressful experiences as compared to their no-MHI cohort ; and experience subtle persistent consequences despite the subtle nature of the reported head trauma .

Conclusion	Isoflavones proved good treatment options for relief of vulvovaginal atrophy .

Background	Pertrochanteric hip fractures occur in an elderly population and cause considerable morbidity and loss of functional ability as the fracture heals .
Background	Recently , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis , has been shown to potentially accelerate bone healing in animal and human studies .
Background	If its administration could allow a faster functional recovery after pertrochanteric hip fracture , then a patient 's hospital stay may be reduced and rehabilitation could be potentially accelerated .
Background	PTH can currently only be administered by subcutaneous injection .
Background	The acceptability of this intervention is unknown in this elderly population .
Background	The aim of this pilot study is to inform the design of a future powered study comparing the functional recovery after pertrochanteric hip fracture in patients undergoing standard care versus those who undergo administration of subcutaneous injection of PTH .
Method	The study is an open label , prospective , randomised , comparative pilot study with blinded outcomes assessment to establish feasibility of the trial design .
Method	Patients will be randomised to receive a @-week course of PTH or usual treatment .
Method	Functional outcomes will be assessed at @ weeks and @ weeks .
Method	Blinded assessment will be used to minimise the effect of bias of an open label study design .
Method	A nested qualitative study will investigate the patient experience of , and expectations following , hip fracture and the patient important aspects of recovery compared with the outcome measures proposed .
Result	Results will be analysed to establish the potential recruitment , compliance and retention rates using @ % CIs , and trial outcomes quoted with SDs and @ % CIs for the effect size .

Method	We report on clinical outcomes in patients with first-degree AV-block ( PR interval > @ ms ) compared with patients who had a normal PR interval at baseline .
Result	Patients with first-degree AV-block ( n = @ ) were older ( median -LSB- Q@ , Q@ -RSB- ; @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- years vs @ -LSB- @ , @ -RSB- years , P < @ ) , more often male ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) , and had more comorbidity , such as hypertension ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and heart failure ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) than patients with normal AV-conduction ( n = @,@ ) .
Result	In multivariable analyses , patients with first-degree AV-block were at greater risk of death , stroke , or heart failure hospitalization ( hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Result	A trend towards a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation was seen ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Result	No significant interactions between pacing arm and prolonged versus normal PR were found for any endpoint , and hazard ratios were consistent across subgroups .
Conclusion	First-degree AV-block is associated with more advanced disease but is still an independent predictor of poor clinical outcome .
Conclusion	Neither DDD-R nor VVI-R pacing , as employed in MOST , eliminate the negative effects associated with first-degree AV-block .

Problem	Less than @ % of stroke patients arrive to an emergency department within the @-hour treatment window .
Problem	Stroke Warning Information and Faster Treatment ( SWIFT ) compared an interactive intervention ( II ) with enhanced educational ( EE ) materials on recurrent stroke arrival times in a prospective cohort of multiethnic stroke/transient ischemic attack survivors .
Method	A single-center randomized controlled trial ( @-@ ) randomized participants to EE ( bilingual stroke preparedness materials ) or II ( EE plus in-hospital sessions ) .
Method	We assessed differences by randomization in the proportion arriving to emergency department < @ hours , prepost intervention arrival < @ hours , incidence rate ratio for total events , and stroke knowledge and preparedness capacity .
Result	SWIFT randomized @ participants ( @ EE , @ II ) : mean age @ years ; @ % female , @ % black , @ % Hispanic , @ % white .
Result	At baseline , @ % arrived to emergency department < @ hours .
Result	Over @ years , first recurrent stroke ( n = @ ) , transient ischemic attacks ( n = @ ) , or stroke mimics ( n = @ ) were documented in @ participants .
Result	Incidence rate ratio = @ ( @ % confidence interval = @-@ @ ; II to EE ) .
Result	Among II , @ % arrived < @ hours versus @ % EE ( P = @ ) .
Result	In prepost analysis , there was a @ % increase in the proportion arriving < @ hours ( P = @ ) , greatest among Hispanics ( @ % , P < @ ) .
Result	II had greater stroke knowledge at @ month ( odds ratio = @ ; @-@ @ ) .
Result	II had higher preparedness capacity at @ month ( odds ratio = @ ; @ , @ ) and @ months ( odds ratio = @ ; @ , @ ) .
Conclusion	There was no difference in arrival < @ hours overall between II and EE ; the proportion arriving < @ hours increased in both groups and in race-ethnic minorities .

Background	Sutezolid ( PNU-@ ) is a linezolid analog with superior bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the hollow fiber , whole blood and mouse models .
Background	Like linezolid , it is unaffected by mutations conferring resistance to standard TB drugs .
Background	This study of sutezolid is its first in tuberculosis patients .
Method	Sputum smear positive tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to sutezolid @ mg BID ( N = @ ) or @ mg QD ( N = @ ) , or standard @-drug therapy ( N = @ ) for the first @ days of treatment .
Method	Effects on mycobacterial burden in sputum ( early bactericidal activity or EBA ) were monitored as colony counts on agar and time to positivity in automated liquid culture .
Method	Bactericidal activity was also measured in ex vivo whole blood cultures ( whole blood bactericidal activity or WBA ) inoculated with M. tuberculosis H@Rv .
Result	All patients completed assigned treatments and began subsequent standard TB treatment according to protocol .
Result	The @ % confidence intervals ( CI ) for bactericidal activity in sputum over the @ day interval excluded zero for all treatments and both monitoring methods , as did those for cumulative WBA .
Result	There were no treatment-related serious adverse events , premature discontinuations , or dose reductions due to laboratory abnormalities .
Result	There was no effect on the QT interval .
Result	Seven sutezolid-treated patients ( @ % ) had transient , asymptomatic ALT elevations to @ U/L on day @ that subsequently normalized promptly ; none met Hy 's criteria for serious liver injury .
Conclusion	The mycobactericidal activity of sutezolid @ mg BID or @ mg QD was readily detected in sputum and blood .
Conclusion	Both schedules were generally safe and well tolerated .
Conclusion	Further studies of sutezolid in tuberculosis treatment are warranted .

Problem	Topical glaucoma medications lower intraocular pressure and alter the course of the disease .
Problem	Because adherence with glaucoma medications is a known problem , interventions are needed to help those patients who do not take their medications as prescribed .
Problem	To assess the ability of an automated telecommunication-based intervention to improve adherence with glaucoma medications .
Method	We performed a prospective cohort study of medication adherence , followed by a randomized intervention for those found to be nonadherent , of individuals recruited from a university-based glaucoma subspecialty clinic .
Method	A total of @ participants were enrolled in the initial assessment of adherence .
Method	Of those , @ were nonadherent with their medications after @ months of electronic monitoring and randomized to intervention and control groups .
Method	A personal health record was used to store the list of patient medications and reminder preferences .
Method	On the basis of those data , participants randomized to the intervention received daily messages , either text or voice , reminding them to take their medication .
Method	Participants randomized to the control group received usual care .
Method	Difference in adherence before and after initiation of the intervention .
Result	Using an intent-to-treat analysis , we found that the median adherence rate in the @ participants randomized to the intervention increased from @ % to @ % ( P < @ ) .
Result	There was no statistical change in @ participants in the control group .
Result	To assess the real efficacy of the intervention , the same comparison was performed for the participants who successfully completed the study after randomization .
Result	Analyzed this way , the adherence rate in the @ participants in the intervention group increased from @ % to @ % ( P < @ ) , whereas there was again no statistical change in the @ participants in the control group .
Result	Eighty-four percent of the participants who received reminders agreed they were helpful and would continue using them outside the study .
Conclusion	Automated telecommunication-based reminders linked to data in a personal health record improved adherence with once-daily glaucoma medications .
Conclusion	This is an effective method to improve adherence that could realistically be implemented in ophthalmology practices with a minimum amount of effort on the part of the practice or the patient .

Problem	To evaluate efficacy and safety of superior hypogastric plexus neurolysis ( SHN ) for treatment of interstitial cystitis ( IC ) - bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ) in comparison with bladder hydrodistention ( HD ) .
Method	In a prospective study , @ female patients were randomly allocated to receive either SHN or HD .
Method	Patients were evaluated by recording the O'Leary-Sant IC symptom indices , IC problem indices , pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) , number of daytime frequency , and nocturia .
Method	Pressure flow study was conducted for all patients .
Method	Intraoperative and postoperative changes and adverse events were recorded .
Result	Basal IC symptom indices , IC problem indices , and VAS scores were comparable between both groups ( P = @ , @ , and @ , respectively ) .
Result	There was no statistically significant difference between both groups with respect to urodynamic parameters .
Result	Only pain VAS at first week was improved in SHN in comparison with HD ( P = @ ) .
Result	Thereafter , all parameters were significantly improved in favor of the HD group at @ - and @-week visits .
Result	Adverse events in both groups were ranked as Grade @ Clavien-Dindo classification including transient hematuria in the HD group and transient back ache in the SHN group .
Conclusion	Despite effective pain control in cases with IC-BPS after SHN , it lacks durability .
Conclusion	It seems that SHN in its current form is not to be a suitable line of treatment for IC-BPS .
Conclusion	Multimodality treatment would be needed for proper control of patients ' symptoms .

Problem	The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of a @-week indoor intermittent training program on lung function , physical capacity , body composition and quality of life in children with asthma .
Method	Participants were randomized in an experimental group ( EG , @ children , age = @ years ) and in a control group ( CG , @ children , age = @ years ) .
Method	The training program was conducted indoors and consisted of alternating high - and low-intensity stimuli , for three sessions of @min/week , for @ weeks .
Method	Physical exercise and sports activities were organized to follow the criteria of the American College of Sports Medicine ( @ ) and previous interventions ' studies .
Result	In EG , there was a significant improvement ( p < @ ) in FEV@ , FEV@ , @MWT , handgrip strength , CMJ and flexibility .
Result	Reductions in BMI and fat mass as well as an increase in quality of life were all shown .
Result	The dyspnea index decreased significantly and there were no episodes of EIA .
Result	There is a significant positive correlation ( p < @ ) between the FEV@ with handgrip strength and @MWT and a negative correlation with fat mass .
Conclusion	An indoor intermittent training program with these characteristics has improved lung function , physical capacity , body composition and quality of life in children with asthma .
Conclusion	These training adaptations are particularly relevant for those patients suffering from asthma as a regular physical exercise routine will greatly improve their quality of life .

Problem	Protocolized sedation improves clinical outcomes in critically ill adults , but its effect in children is unknown .
Problem	To determine whether critically ill children managed with a nurse-implemented , goal-directed sedation protocol experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care .
Method	Cluster randomized trial conducted in @ US pediatric intensive care units ( PICUs ) .
Method	A total of @ children ( mean age , @ years ; range , @ weeks to @ years ) mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure were enrolled in @-@ and followed up until @ hours after opioids were discontinued , @ days , or hospital discharge .
Method	Intervention PICUs ( @ sites ; n = @ patients ) used a protocol that included targeted sedation , arousal assessments , extubation readiness testing , sedation adjustment every @ hours , and sedation weaning .
Method	Control PICUs ( @ sites ; n = @ patients ) managed sedation per usual care .
Method	The primary outcome was duration of mechanical ventilation .
Method	Secondary outcomes included time to recovery from acute respiratory failure , duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation , neurological testing , PICU and hospital lengths of stay , in-hospital mortality , sedation-related adverse events , measures of sedative exposure ( wakefulness , pain , and agitation ) , and occurrence of iatrogenic withdrawal .
Result	Duration of mechanical ventilation was not different between the @ groups ( intervention : median , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ @ -RSB- days ; control : median , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ @ -RSB- days ) .
Result	Sedation-related adverse events including inadequate pain and sedation management , clinically significant iatrogenic withdrawal , and unplanned endotracheal tube/invasive line removal were not significantly different between the @ groups .
Result	Intervention patients experienced more postextubation stridor ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) and fewer stage @ or worse immobility-related pressure ulcers ( < @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
Result	In exploratory analyses , intervention patients had fewer days of opioid administration ( median , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ -RSB- days vs @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ -RSB- days ; P = @ ) , were exposed to fewer sedative classes ( median , @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ -RSB- classes vs @ -LSB- IQR , @-@ -RSB- classes ; P < @ ) , and were more often awake and calm while intubated ( median , @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- of days vs @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- of days ; P = @ ) than control patients , respectively ; however , intervention patients had more days with any report of a pain score @ ( median , @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- of days vs @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- of days ; P < @ ) and any report of agitation ( median , @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- vs @ % -LSB- IQR , @ % -@ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) , respectively .
Conclusion	Among children undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure , the use of a sedation protocol compared with usual care did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation .
Conclusion	Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes suggest a complex relationship among wakefulness , pain , and agitation .

Problem	Examine the short-term ( acute ) effects of methylphenidate ( MPH ) on math performance in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and what factors predict improvement in math performance .
Method	One hundred ninety-eight children with ADHD participated in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized crossover MPH trial .
Method	Math response to MPH was determined through administration of math problems adjusted to their academic level during the Restricted Academic Situation Scale ( RASS ) .
Method	Student t tests were conducted to assess change in math performance with psychostimulants .
Method	Correlation between change on the RASS and change on the math performance was also examined .
Method	Linear regression was performed to determine predictor variables .
Result	Children with ADHD improved significantly in their math with MPH ( P < @ ) .
Result	The degree of improvement on the RASS ( which evaluates motor activity and orientation to task ) and on math performance on MPH was highly correlated .
Result	A child 's age at baseline and Wechsler Individual Achievement Test ( WIAT ) - Numerical Operations standard scores at baseline accounted for @ % of variances for acute math improvement .
Conclusion	MPH improves acute math performance in children with ADHD .
Conclusion	Younger children with lower math scores ( as assessed by the WIAT ) improved most on math scores when given psychostimulants .

Background	The PRODIGY trial ( Prevention of long term social disability amongst young people with emerging psychological difficulties , ISRCTN@ ) is a pilot trial of social recovery cognitive-behavioural therapy ( SRCBT ) .
Problem	The PRODIGY qualitative substudy aimed to ( a ) explore individual experiences of participating in the pilot randomised , controlled trial ( recruitment , randomisation , assessment ) and initial views of therapy , and ( b ) to explore perceived benefits of taking part in research v. ethical concerns and potential risks .
Method	Qualitative investigation using semi-structured interviews with thematic analysis .
Result	Analysis revealed participant experiences around the key themes of acceptability , disclosure , practicalities , altruism and engagement .
Conclusion	Participants in both trial arms perceived themselves as gaining benefits from being involved in the study , above and beyond the intervention .
Conclusion	This has implications for the design of future research and services for this client group , highlighting the importance of being flexible and an individualised approach as key engagement tools .

Background	The MEK inhibitor , selumetinib , suppresses soft-tissue sarcoma ( STS ) cell proliferation in vitro .
Background	Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors possess modest activity against STS ; however , resistance develops via MAPK pathway feedback activation .
Background	The combination of selumetinib and temsirolimus synergistically inhibits STS cell line growth .
Background	Therefore , a randomized phase II trial of selumetinib vs selumetinib plus temsirolimus was conducted .
Method	Seventy-one adults with advanced STS who received @ prior chemotherapeutics were randomized to selumetinib @ mg p.o. bid and allowed to crossover upon progression , or to selumetinib @ mg p.o. bid plus temsirolimus @ mg i.v. weekly , with primary endpoint of progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
Result	There was no difference in PFS between the two arms for the overall cohort ( median @ vs @ months ) ; an improved median PFS was observed in the combination arm ( N = @ ) over single agent ( N = @ ) in the prespecified leiomyosarcoma stratum ( median @ vs @ months ; P = @ ) .
Result	Four-month PFS rate was @ % ( @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) with the combination vs @ % with selumetinib alone in the leiomyosarcoma cohort .
Result	Most common grade @/@ adverse events with the combination were mucositis ( @ % ) , lymphopenia ( @ % ) , neutropenia and anaemia ( @ % each ) .
Conclusion	While single-agent selumetinib has no significant activity in STS , the combination may be active for leiomyosarcomas .

Problem	This international phase III trial ( Investigating Torisel As Second-Line Therapy -LSB- INTORSECT -RSB- ) compared the efficacy of temsirolimus ( mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ) and sorafenib ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor -LSB- VEGFR -RSB- tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) after disease progression on sunitinib .
Method	In total , @ patients were randomly assigned @:@ to receive intravenous temsirolimus @ mg once weekly ( n = @ ) or oral sorafenib @ mg twice per day ( n = @ ) , with stratification according to duration of prior sunitinib therapy ( or > @ days ) , prognostic risk , histology ( clear cell or non-clear cell ) , and nephrectomy status .
Method	The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) by independent review committee assessment .
Method	Safety , objective response rate ( ORR ) , and overall survival ( OS ) were secondary end points .
Result	Primary analysis revealed no significant difference between treatment arms for PFS ( stratified hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; two-sided P = @ ) or ORR .
Result	Median PFS in the temsirolimus and sorafenib arms were @ and @ months , respectively .
Result	There was a significant OS difference in favor of sorafenib ( stratified HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; two-sided P = @ ) .
Result	Median OS in the temsirolimus and sorafenib arms was @ and @ months , respectively .
Result	Safety profiles of both agents were consistent with previous studies .
Conclusion	In patients with mRCC and progression on sunitinib , second-line temsirolimus did not demonstrate a PFS advantage compared with sorafenib .
Conclusion	The longer OS observed with sorafenib suggests sequenced VEGFR inhibition may benefit patients with mRCC .

Background	Electroencephalographic ( EEG ) status epilepticus is described in @ to @ % of patients with postanoxic encephalopathy after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation and is associated with case fatality rates of @ to @ % .
Background	It is unclear whether these EEG patterns represent a condition to be treated with anticonvulsants to improve outcome , or an expression of severe ischemic damage , in which treatment is futile .
Method	TELSTAR is a multicenter clinical trial with two parallel groups , randomized treatment allocation , open label treatment , and blinded endpoint evaluation ( PROBE design ) .
Method	We aim to enroll @ adult patients with postanoxic encephalopathy and electroencephalographic status epilepticus after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation , admitted to the ICU , in whom continuous EEG monitoring is started within @ hours after admission .
Method	Patients are randomly assigned to either medical treatment to suppress all electrographic seizure activity , or no treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus .
Method	Antiepileptic treatment is based on guidelines for treatment of overt status epilepticus and is started within @ hours after the diagnosis .
Method	If status epilepticus returns during tapering of sedative medication after suppression of all epileptiform activity for @ @ hours , it will be considered refractory .
Method	The primary outcome measure is neurological outcome defined as the Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) score at @ months , dichotomized into ` good ' ( CPC @ to @ = no or moderate neurological disability ) and ` poor ' ( CPC @ to @ = severe disability , coma , or death ) .
Method	Secondary outcome measures include mortality and , for patients surviving up to @ months , cognitive functioning , health related quality of life , and depression .

Background	IGF-I is thought to mediate many of the anabolic actions of GH , and there are anecdotal reports that IGF-I is misused by elite athletes .
Background	There is no published evidence regarding the effects of IGF-I administration on athletic performance .
Problem	The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of IGF-I administration on body composition and physical fitness in recreational athletes .
Method	This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled recombinant human ( rh ) IGF-I/rhIGF binding protein ( IGFBP ) -@ administration study at Southampton General Hospital ( Southampton , United Kingdom ) .
Method	Fifty-six recreational athletes ( @ men , @ women ) participated in the study .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo , low-dose rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -@ ( @ mg/d ) , or high dose rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -@ ( @ mg/d ) for @ days .
Method	Body composition ( assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( assessed by incremental treadmill test ) were measured before and immediately after treatment .
Method	Within-individual changes after treatment were analyzed using paired t tests .
Result	There were no significant changes in body fat mass or lean body mass in women or men after the administration of the rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -@ complex .
Result	There was a significant increase in maximal oxygen consumption ( VO@ max ) after treatment .
Result	When women and men and low - and high-dose treatment groups were combined , mean VO@ max increased by approximately @ % ( P = @ ) .
Result	No significant change in VO@ max was observed in the placebo group .
Conclusion	rhIGF-I/rhIGFBP -@ administration for @ days improves aerobic performance in recreational athletes , but there are no effects on body composition .

Problem	The study aimed to confirm the efficacy , through non-inferiority , of patient-driven versus investigator-driven titration of biphasic insulin aspart @ ( BIAsp @ ) in terms of glycemic control assessed by HbA@c change .
Method	SimpleMix was a @ week , open-label , randomized , two-armed , parallel-group , multicenter study in five countries ( Argentina , China , India , Poland , and the UK ) .
Method	Patients with type @ diabetes were randomized into either patient-driven or investigator-driven BIAsp @ titration groups .
Result	Non-inferiority of patient-driven vs. investigator-driven titration based on change in HbA@c from baseline to week @ could not be demonstrated .
Result	Mean ( SE ) estimated change from baseline to week @ was -@ ( @ ) % in the patient-driven group and -@ ( @ ) % in the investigator-driven group ; estimated difference @ % ( @ % CI : @ ; @ ) .
Result	Estimated mean change ( SE ) in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week @ was similar between groups : -@ ( @ ) mmol/L for patient-driven and -@ ( @ ) mmol/L for investigator-driven ( difference non-significant ) .
Result	Both treatment arms were well tolerated , and hypoglycemic episode rates were similar between groups , with a rate ratio of @ ( @ % CI : @ ; @ ; p = @ ) for all hypoglycemic episodes and @ ( @ % CI : @ ; @ ; p = @ ) for nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes .
Conclusion	Non-inferiority of patient-driven versus investigator-driven titration with regard to change from baseline to end-of-treatment HbA@c could not be confirmed .
Conclusion	It is possible that a clinic visit @ weeks after intensification of treatment with BIAsp @ in patients with type @ diabetes inadequately treated with basal insulin may benefit patient-driven titration of BIAsp @ .
Conclusion	A limitation of the study was the relatively small number of patients recruited in each country , which does not allow country-specific analyses to be performed .
Conclusion	Overall , treatment with BIAsp @ was well tolerated in both treatment groups .

Problem	Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy has been shown to attenuate the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel .
Problem	The aim of this study was to compare the antiplatelet effects of cilostazol versus clopidogrel in patients co-administered a PPI .
Method	We enrolled PPI-nave stented patients treated with standard clopidogrel and aspirin therapy for at least six months ( n = @ ) .
Method	The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilostazol at a dose of @mg twice daily ( CILO group ) or clopidogrel at a dose of @mg daily ( CLPD group ) in addition to lansoprazole ( @mg daily ) .
Method	The platelet aggregation ( PA ) determined using light transmittance aggregometry and the platelet reactivity index ( PRI ) obtained using a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay were measured before randomization and at the @-day follow-up visit .
Method	The primary endpoint was the PRI value at follow-up .
Result	At follow-up , the CLPD group showed similar values of PRI as the CILO group ( @ % vs. @ % ; mean difference : @ % ; @ % confidence interval of difference : -@ % to @ % ; p = @ ) .
Result	However , the @g/mL collagen - and @ mg/mL arachidonic acid-induced PA values in the CLPD group were higher than those observed in the CILO group ( mean differences : @ % to @ % ; all p values @ ) .
Result	CYP@C@ loss-of-function allele carriage was the major contributing factor associated with the PRI level in the absence of lansoprazole treatment ( with a gene-dose effect ) ; this association was not observed in the subjects receiving lansoprazole co-administration in the CLPD group .
Conclusion	During lansoprazole co-administration , cilostazol treatment achieves a more favorable platelet function profile than clopidogrel therapy .
Conclusion	The use of combination treatment with cilostazol and aspirin deserves further attention with respect to the management of stable stented patients requiring PPI co-administration .

Background	Plasmodium falciparum malaria is treated with @ mg/kg of chloroquine ( CQ ) irrespective of age .
Background	Theoretically , CQ should be dosed according to body surface area ( BSA ) .
Background	The effect of dosing CQ according to BSA has not been determined but doubling the dose per kg doubled the efficacy of CQ in children aged < @ years infected with P. falciparum carrying CQ resistance causing genes typical for Africa .
Background	The study aim was to determine the effect of age on CQ concentrations .
Result	Day @ whole blood CQ concentrations were determined in @ and @ children treated with @ and @ mg/kg , respectively , in previously conducted clinical trials .
Result	CQ concentrations normalised for the dose taken in mg/kg of CQ decreased with decreasing age ( p < @ ) .
Result	CQ concentrations normalised for dose taken in mg/m ( @ ) were unaffected by age .
Result	The median CQ concentration in children aged < @ years taking @ mg/kg and in children aged @-@ years taking @ mg/kg were @ ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- @-@ ) and @ ( @ % CI @-@ ) nmol/l , respectively ( p = @ ) .
Result	The median CQ concentration in children aged @-@ taking @ mg/kg and children aged @-@ taking @ mg/kg were @ and @ nmol/l .
Result	Adverse events were not age/concentration dependent .
Conclusion	CQ is under-dosed in children and should ideally be dosed according to BSA .
Conclusion	Children aged < @ years need approximately double the dose per kg to attain CQ concentrations found in children aged @-@ years .
Conclusion	Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of CQ in Africa are typically performed in children aged < @ years .
Conclusion	Thus the efficacy of CQ is typically assessed in children in whom CQ is under dosed .
Conclusion	Approximately @ fold higher drug concentrations can probably be safely given to the youngest children .
Conclusion	As CQ resistance is concentration dependent an alternative dosing of CQ may overcome resistance in Africa .

Background	Natural ultraviolet exposure induces hair damage , which is difficult to avoid .
Background	Most of the research work is focused on the effect of ultraviolet on the epidermis , dermis as well as the immune system , whereas the long-term effect of ultraviolet on hair has not been investigated .
Problem	we performed our experiment to find out the changes induced in hair follicle and shaft in those patients exposed to high doses of ultraviolet ( A and B ) during treatment of other skin conditions .
Method	Light and transmission electron microscopy examination of scalp hair follicles and shafts of @ patients with vitiligo under psoralen plus ultraviolet A ( group @ ) and @ patients with vitiligo under narrow band ultraviolet B ( group @ ) was carried out and compared with those of @ healthy volunteers ( group @ ) .
Result	Physical changes in the appearance of hair were more in groups @ and @ than control .
Result	Reduced hair follicle thickness and perifollicular infiltrate and hyaline disorganized perifollicular collagen were observed more in group @ than in group @ with the absence of these changes in group @ .
Result	Transmission electron microscopy showed nonspecific cell injury in hair follicles in group @ more than the other @ groups , while the damaging effect on hair was more in the second group than the others .
Conclusion	Due to the damaging effect of ultraviolet on hair , patients under treatment with this modality should be cautious to protect their hair during treatment .

Background	Fecal immunochemical tests ( FITs ) are recommended to screen average-risk adults for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .
Background	Little research has examined whether a two-sample FIT affects participant uptake , compared with a one-sample FIT .
Background	Examining participant uptake is important , as evidence suggests that a two-sample FIT may increase the sensitivity to detect CRC .
Problem	This study had two objectives : ( i ) to evaluate FIT completion in a population that received either a one-sample FIT kit ( @-FIT ) or a two-sample FIT kit ( @-FIT ) and ( ii ) to understand whether uptake varies by age , sex , or receipt of prior CRC screening .
Method	We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which @ participants who were aged between @ and @ years and were at an average risk for CRC , and who had requested FITs , randomly received @-FIT ( n = @ ) or @-FIT ( n = @ ) kits .
Method	FIT completion was defined as the completion and return of a one-sample test by the patients in the @-FIT group or of both sample tests by those in the @-FIT group .
Method	Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the independent effect of group type ( @-FIT vs. @-FIT ) on the completion of the FIT , adjusting for age , sex , and receipt of prior CRC screening .
Result	The @-FIT group had lower test completion rates ( hazard ratio = @ ; @ % confidence interval = @-@ @ ; P = @ ) after adjusting for age , sex , and receipt of prior CRC screening .
Result	Participant uptake did not vary by age , sex , or receipt of prior CRC screening .
Conclusion	This unique , rigorous randomized controlled trial found that the @-FIT regimen decreases completion of FIT .
Conclusion	Further research is needed to understand whether decreases in participant uptake are offset by increased gains in test sensitivity .

Problem	Intramuscular botulinum toxin-A ( BoNT-A ) injections reduce spasticity by blocking neurotransmission at the motor endplate ( MEP ) .
Problem	The goal of this study was to assess the reduction in spasticity achieved by injecting BoNT-A at different sites of the gracilis muscle .
Method	Thirty-four gracilis muscles , in @ children ( @ females and @ males , mean age of @ y -LSB- SD @ y -RSB- ) with spastic cerebral palsy ( unilateral and bilateral , Gross Motor Function Classification System -LSB- GMFCS -RSB- levels I-IV ) , were randomly assigned to one of two groups .
Method	In one group BoNT-A was injected proximally ( at a site @ % of the distance from the pubic tubercle and the medial epicondyle ) and in the other it was injected at the MEP zones ( half of the dose was administered at @ % of this distance and half at @ % ) .
Method	Spasticity was assessed before and after BoNT-A injection using simultaneous measurements of surface electromyography ( sEMG ) and angular velocity during passive muscle stretch applied at different velocities .
Method	The primary outcome measure included the velocity-dependent change in average root mean square electromyography ( RMS-EMG ) .
Method	Secondary outcome was assessed with the Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) and Modified Tardieu Scale ( MTS ) .
Result	Spasticity decreased more in MEP-targeted muscles than in proximally injected muscles , as demonstrated by a larger reduction in average RMS-EMG values ( p = @ ) , though this difference was not found with the MAS or MTS .
Conclusion	The results suggest that BoNT-A injection of the gracilis at sites with a high concentration of MEPs is effective at reducing spasticity .
Conclusion	These preliminary findings should be confirmed by larger studies .
Conclusion	In the case of long muscles , such as the gracilis , the injection site is important .

Background	Fluralaner is a novel systemic insecticide and acaricide .
Background	The purpose of these studies was to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of fluralaner in Beagle dogs following single oral or intravenous ( i.v. ) administration .
Method	Following the oral administration of @ , @ or @ mg fluralaner/kg body weight ( BW ) , formulated as chewable tablets or i.v. administration of @ mg fluralaner/kg BW , formulated as i.v. solution to @ Beagles , plasma samples were collected until @ days after treatment .
Method	Plasma concentrations of fluralaner were measured using HPLC-MS/MS .
Method	Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods .
Result	After oral administration , maximum plasma concentrations ( C ( max ) ) were reached within @ day on average .
Result	Fluralaner was quantifiable in plasma for up to @ days after single oral and i.v. treatment .
Result	The apparent half-life of fluralaner was @-@ days and the mean residence time was @-@ days .
Result	The apparent volume of distribution of fluralaner was @ L/kg , and clearance was @ L/kg/day .
Conclusion	Fluralaner is readily absorbed after single-dose oral administration , and has a long elimination half-life , long mean residence time , relatively high apparent volume of distribution , and low clearance .
Conclusion	These pharmacokinetic characteristics help to explain the prolonged activity of fluralaner against fleas and ticks on dogs after a single oral dose .

Background	While many researchers often use a theoretical framework for mammogram repeat interventions , it seems they do not apply an identified mediation analysis method .
Background	The aim of this study was to determine the mediators of mammogram replication behavior in two tailored interventions for non-adherent Iranian women .
Method	A sample population of @ women over @ years old in Sanandaj , Iran , was selected for an experiment .
Method	Participants were randomly allocated into one of the three conditions : @ ) an intervention based on the Health Belief Model ( HBM ) @ ) an intervention based on an integration of the HBM and selected constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior ( TPB ) , and @ ) a control group .
Method	Constructs were measured before the intervention , and after a @-month follow-up .
Result	Perceived self-efficacy , behavioral control , and subjective norms were recognized as mediators in the HBM and selected constructs from the TPB intervention .
Result	Perceived susceptibility , severity , barriers , self-efficacy and behavioral control met the criteria for mediation in the HBM intervention .
Conclusion	This study was successful in establishing mediation in a sample of women .
Conclusion	Our findings enrich the literature on mammography repeat , indicating key intervention factors , and relegating redundant ones in the Iranian populations .
Conclusion	The use of strategies to increase mammography repeat , such HBM and TPB constructs is suggested to be important for maintaining a screening behavior , once the behavior has been adopted .

Background	More than seven out of @ Dutch construction workers describe their work as physically demanding .
Background	Ergonomic measures can be used to reduce these physically demanding work tasks .
Background	To increase the use of ergonomic measures , employers and workers have to get used to other working methods and to maintaining them .
Background	To facilitate this behavioural change , participatory ergonomics ( PE ) interventions could be useful .
Background	For this study a protocol of a PE intervention is adapted in such a way that the intervention can be performed by an ergonomics consultant through face-to-face contacts or email contacts .
Background	The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the face-to-face guidance strategy and the e-guidance strategy on the primary outcome measure : use of ergonomic measures by individual construction workers , and on the secondary outcome measures : the work ability , physical functioning and limitations due to physical problems of individual workers .
Method	The present study is a randomised intervention trial of six months in @ companies to establish the effects of a PE intervention guided by four face-to-face contacts ( N = @ ) or guided by @ email contacts ( N = @ ) on the primary and secondary outcome measures at baseline and after six months .
Method	Construction companies are randomly assigned to one of the guidance strategies with the help of a computer generated randomisation table .
Method	In addition , a process evaluation for both strategies will be performed to determine reach , dose delivered , dose received , precision , competence , satisfaction and behavioural change to find possible barriers and facilitators for both strategies .
Method	A cost-benefit analysis will be performed to establish the financial consequences of both strategies .
Method	The present study is in accordance with the CONSORT statement .
Conclusion	The outcome of this study will help to @ ) evaluate the effect of both guidance strategies , and @ ) find barriers to and facilitators of both guidance strategies .
Conclusion	When these strategies are effective , implementation within occupational health services can take place to guide construction companies ( and others ) with the implementation of ergonomic measures .

Background	Division of the parenchymal lung for lobectomy is performed in patients who have an incomplete fissure .
Background	A stapler device can reduce postoperative air leak , but it is expensive .
Problem	to investigate the advantage of using a stapler , in terms of postoperative air leak and cost , compared to hand-sewn techniques .
Method	A Non-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in Chiang Mai University Hospital , Thailand , from November @ , @ to September @ , @ .
Method	Fifty-three adult patients were randomized to undergo a hand-sewn technique ( @ patients ) or stapler closure ( @ patients ) .
Result	Postoperative air leak in the stapler group was less than that in the hand-sewn group ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) , and the duration of air leak in the stapler group was significantly shorter than that in the hand-sewn group ( @ vs. @ days , p = @ ) .
Result	The cost of treatment was not significantly different between groups ; however , the total cost in the stapler group was less than that in the hand-sewn group ( mean difference @ Thai baht ( US$ @ ) .
Conclusion	A stapler reduces postoperative air leaks and the duration of air leaks .
Conclusion	Furthermore , the total cost of treatment was comparable .
Conclusion	Therefore , using staples may provide substantial financial benefits .

Problem	The aim of this study was to gain further understanding of placebo response in binge eating disorder .
Method	We pooled participant-level data from @ double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trials of medications for binge eating disorder .
Method	The primary outcomes were response ( @ % reduction in binge eating episodes ) , cessation of binge eating episodes , change in mean weekly binge eating episodes and binge eating episodes per week .
Result	Of @ participants receiving placebo , @ ( @ % ) were responders and @ ( @ % ) attained cessation .
Result	Placebo-treated participants significantly reduced their binge eating .
Result	The mean ( SD ) binge eating episodes per week at baseline was @ ( @ ) and at endpoint was @ ( @ ) .
Result	Lower baseline binge eating episode frequency and longer study participation were significantly associated with response and cessation .
Conclusion	Less severe eating pathology at baseline was associated with higher placebo response and cessation rates .
Conclusion	Future clinical trials may want to stipulate that participants exceed a threshold of illness severity , which may lead to better placebo and drug separation .

Background	Serious case reviews and research studies have indicated weaknesses in risk assessments conducted by child protection social workers .
Background	Social workers are adept at gathering information but struggle with analysis and assessment of risk .
Background	The Department for Education wants to know if the use of a structured decision-making tool can improve child protection assessments of risk .
Method	This multi-site , cluster-randomised trial will assess the effectiveness of the Safeguarding Children Assessment and Analysis Framework ( SAAF ) .
Method	This structured decision-making tool aims to improve social workers ' assessments of harm , of future risk and parents ' capacity to change .
Method	The comparison is management as usual .
Method	Children 's Services Departments ( CSDs ) in England willing to make relevant teams available to be randomised , and willing to meet the trial 's training and data collection requirements .
Method	CSDs where there were concerns about performance ; where a major organisational restructuring was planned or under way ; or where other risk assessment tools were in use.Six CSDs are participating in this study .
Method	Social workers in the experimental arm will receive @ days training in SAAF together with a range of support materials , and access to limited telephone consultation post-training .
Method	The primary outcome is child maltreatment .
Method	This will be assessed using data collected nationally on two key performance indicators : the first is the number of children in a year who have been subject to a second Child Protection Plan ( CPP ) ; the second is the number of re-referrals of children because of related concerns about maltreatment .
Method	Secondary outcomes are : i ) the quality of assessments judged against a schedule of quality criteria and ii ) the relationship between the three assessments required by the structured decision-making tool ( level of harm , risk of ( re ) abuse and prospects for successful intervention ) .
Conclusion	This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of SAAF .
Conclusion	It will contribute to a very limited literature on the contribution that structured decision-making tools can make to improving risk assessment and case planning in child protection and on what is involved in their effective implementation .

Problem	To compare health-related quality-of-life ( HRQoL ) outcomes for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy ( RARC ) with those of traditional open radical cystectomy ( ORC ) in a prospective randomised fashion .
Method	This was a prospective randomised clinical trial evaluating the HRQoL for ORC vs RARC in consecutive patients from July @ to June @ .
Method	We administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index questionnaire , validated to assess HRQoL , preoperatively and then at @ , @ , @ and @ months postoperatively .
Method	Scores for each domain and total scores were compared in terms of deviation from preoperative values for both the RARC and the ORC cohorts .
Method	Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the association between the type of radical cystectomy and HRQoL .
Result	At the time of the study , @ patients had met the inclusion criteria , with @ patients being randomised for analysis .
Result	The cohorts consisted of @ patients undergoing ORC and @ undergoing RARC , who were balanced with respect to baseline demographic and clinical features .
Result	Univariate analysis showed a return to baseline scores at @ months postoperatively in all measured domains with no statistically significant difference among the various domains between the RARC and the ORC cohorts .
Result	Multivariate analysis showed no difference in HRQoL between the two approaches in any of the various domains , with the exception of a slightly higher physical well-being score in the RARC group at @ months .
Conclusion	There were no significant differences in the HRQoL outcomes between ORC and RARC , with a return of quality of life scores to baseline scores @ months after radical cystectomy in both cohorts .

Problem	To evaluate , by means of a prospective randomized study , the efficacy of cinacalcet in the forms of nephrolithiasis associated with primary hyperparathyroidism in both the hypercalcemic and normocalcemic variant .
Method	Ten patients suffering from active nephrolithiasis associated with primary hyperparathyroidism ( @ hypercalcemics and @ normocalcemics ) , equally divided between males and females , were randomly but not blindly addressed to treatment with potassium citrate and allopurinol , or to the same therapeutic regimen in combination with cinacalcet .
Method	The dosage of cinacalcet was optimized for each patient in order to obtain a reduction of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) within normal limits while enabling the maintenance of adequate calcemic values .
Method	All study participants were given the same diet based on a reduction in sodium intake , oxalate-rich foods and animal protein with standardized intake of calcium and an increase in hydration .
Method	After a follow up period of @ months , cinacalcet was associated to standard therapy and diet in patients who were not taken it , conversely cinacalcet was withdrawn in the remaining patients who remained on standard therapeutic regimen and diet .
Method	Follow up was continued for a second period of observation of the same duration of the first .
Result	At the end of the period of treatment with cinacalcet , for both variants of hyperparathyroidism , a statistically significant reduction in the overall number and in the diameter of renal stones was found .
Conclusion	This prospective randomized study shows the effectiveness of cinacalcet used in combination with a diet with normalized calcium intake , in reducing the number and size of urinary stones in hypercalemic and normocalcemic forms of primary hyperparathyroidism .

Problem	To compare the effect of incomplete caries removal ( ICR ) and indirect pulp capping ( IPC ) with calcium hydroxide ( CH ) or an inert material ( wax ) on color , consistency and contamination of the remaining dentin of primary molars .
Method	This double-blind , parallel-design , randomized controlled trial included @ children presenting one primary molar with deep caries lesion .
Method	Children were randomly assigned after ICR to receive IPC with CH or wax .
Method	All teeth were then restored with resin composite .
Method	Baseline dentin color and consistency were evaluated after ICR , and dentin samples were collected for contamination analyses using scanning electron microscopy .
Method	After @ months , restorations were removed and the three parameters were re-evaluated .
Method	In both groups , dentin became significantly darker after @ months .
Result	No cases of yellow dentin were observed after @ months with CH compared to @ % of the wax cases ( P < @ ) .
Result	A statistically significant difference over time was observed only for CH regarding consistency .
Result	CH stimulated a dentin hardening process in a statistically higher number of cases than wax ( @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) .
Result	Contamination changed significantly over time in CH and wax without significant difference between groups .
Result	It was concluded that CH and wax arrested the carious process of the remaining carious dentin after indirect pulp capping , but CH showed superior dentin color and consistency after @ months .

Problem	Invasive candidiasis in premature infants causes death and neurodevelopmental impairment .
Problem	Fluconazole prophylaxis reduces candidiasis , but its effect on mortality and the safety of fluconazole are unknown .
Problem	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in preventing death or invasive candidiasis in extremely low-birth-weight infants .
Method	This study was a randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole in premature infants .
Method	Infants weighing less than @ g at birth ( N = @ ) from @ neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ) in the United States were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole or placebo twice weekly for @ days .
Method	Surviving infants were evaluated at @ to @ months corrected age for neurodevelopmental outcomes .
Method	The study was conducted between November @ and February @ .
Method	Fluconazole ( @ mg/kg of body weight ) or placebo .
Method	The primary end point was a composite of death or definite or probable invasive candidiasis prior to study day @ ( @ week after completion of study drug ) .
Method	Secondary and safety outcomes included invasive candidiasis , liver function , bacterial infection , length of stay , intracranial hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia , chronic lung disease , patent ductus arteriosus requiring surgery , retinopathy of prematurity requiring surgery , necrotizing enterocolitis , spontaneous intestinal perforation , and neurodevelopmental outcomes-defined as a Bayley-III cognition composite score of less than @ , blindness , deafness , or cerebral palsy at @ to @ months corrected age .
Result	Among infants receiving fluconazole , the composite primary end point of death or invasive candidiasis was @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) vs @ % in the placebo group ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ; odds ratio , @ -LSB- @ % CI , @-@ @ -RSB- ; P = @ ; treatment difference , -@ % -LSB- @ % CI , -@ % to @ % -RSB- ) .
Result	Invasive candidiasis occurred less frequently in the fluconazole group ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ) vs the placebo group ( @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ; P = @ ; treatment difference , -@ % -LSB- @ % CI , -@ % to -@ % -RSB- ) .
Result	The cumulative incidences of other secondary outcomes were not statistically different between groups .
Result	Neurodevelopmental impairment did not differ between the groups ( fluconazole , @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- vs placebo , @ % -LSB- @ % CI , @ % -@ % -RSB- ; P = @ ; treatment difference , @ % -LSB- @ % CI , -@ % to @ % -RSB- ) .
Conclusion	Among infants with a birth weight of less than @ g , @ days of fluconazole prophylaxis compared with placebo did not result in a lower incidence of the composite of death or invasive candidiasis .
Conclusion	These findings do not support the universal use of prophylactic fluconazole in extremely low-birth-weight infants .

Problem	To compare tidal breathing on different continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) devices and pressures and to serially measure tidal breathing during weaning off CPAP using electromagnetic inductive plethysmography .
Method	Using electromagnetic inductive plethysmography , tidal breathing was measured in @ preterm infants receiving CPAP , gestational age @ @ weeks .
Method	Variable-flow nasal CPAP ( nCPAP ) , bubble CPAP ( bCPAP ) at pressures of @ , @ , and @ cmH@O , nasal bi-level positive airway pressure ( nBiPAP ) system at pressures of @ , @/@ , and @/@ cmH@O , and unsupported breathing were studied .
Method	Twenty-one infants had weekly tidal breathing measurements on and off nCPAP .
Result	Minute volume ( MV/kg ) was similar between all devices ( @-@ @ L/kg/min ) .
Result	On bCPAP , weight corrected tidal volume ( VT/kg ) was the least , changing little with increasing pressures .
Result	On nCPAP and nBiPAP , VT/kg increased with increasing pressure and the respiratory rate ( fR ) decreased .
Result	The delivered pressure varied slightly from the set pressure being most dissimilar on nBiPAP and similar on bCPAP .
Result	Compared with unsupported breathing , all devices decreased VT/kg , MV/kg , and phase angle , but did not alter fR .
Result	Serial tidal breathing measurements showed decreasing difference for VT/kg over time on and off nCPAP .
Conclusion	At different pressure settings , on all CPAP devices the measured MV/kg was similar either through increasing VT/kg and decreasing fR ( nCPAP and nBiPAP ) or maintaining both ( bCPAP ) .
Conclusion	Serial tidal breathing measurements may aid weaning from CPAP .

Background	Despite the intensive global efforts to control intestinal parasitic infections , the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections is still very high in many developing countries particularly among children in rural areas .
Method	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted on @ Aboriginal schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high-dose of vitamin A supplementation ( @,@ IU ) on STH reinfection .
Method	The effect of the supplement was assessed at @ and @ months after receiving interventions ; after a complete @-day deworming course of @ mg/daily of albendazole tablets .
Result	Almost all children ( @ % ) were infected with at least one STH species .
Result	The overall prevalence of ascariasis , trichuriasis and hookworm infection was @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively .
Result	Reinfection rates of Ascaris , Trichuris and hookworm were high ; at @ months , assessment reached @ % of the prevalence reported before treatment .
Result	There were no significant differences in the reinfection rates and intensities of STH between vitamin A supplemented-children and those who received placebo at @ and @ months ( p > @ ) .
Conclusion	Vitamin A supplementation showed no protective effect against STH reinfection and this could be due to the high endemicity of STH in this community .
Conclusion	Long-term interventions to reduce poverty will help significantly in reducing this continuing problem and there is no doubt that reducing intestinal parasitic infection would have a positive impact on the health , nutrition and education of these children .

Background	Patients with stroke suffer from nutrition impairments and often rely on enteral nutrition ( EN ) , which is associated with respiratory complications such as regurgitation and aspiration .
Problem	To evaluate the incidence of regurgitation and aspiration in patients with severe stroke infused with different volumes of EN .
Method	A randomized controlled trial was conducted on @ patients with severe stroke undergoing EN therapy .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned into two groups .
Method	Subjects in the treatment group received EN with an initial rate defined according to the total volume and the infusion rate was adjusted based on gastric residual volume ( GRV ) assessed every @ hours .
Method	Subjects of the control group received EN without monitoring the GRV and reached the target infusion volume within @ hours .
Method	The incidence of reflux and aspiration was recorded .
Result	The incidences of regurgitation and aspiration were significantly lower in treatment group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) than control group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
Result	In the treatment group , @ patient developed regurgitation while @ developed aspiration when EN was @ mL .
Result	When EN increased to @ mL , @ patients developed regurgitation and @ developed aspiration , and @ patients developed regurgitation and @ had aspiration when EN was @ mL .
Result	There was no significant difference in the risk of reflux and aspiration when total volume of EN increased from @ to @ mL .
Conclusion	During EN therapy for patients with stroke , using feeding pump with a continuous infusion for @ hours and adjusting infusion rate based on GRV could reduce the incidence of respiratory complications .

Problem	To establish during late gestation and early lactation the effects of supplementing silymarin , a natural hepatoprotective substance , combined with a powerful antioxidant , lycopene , on milk production and on serum biomarkers of oxidative status .
Method	Italian Friesian dairy cows were given individually a supplement containing a mixture of silymarin ( @ g/day/cow ) and lycopene ( @ g/day/cow ) ( n = @ ) or no supplement ( control ; n = @ ) .
Method	Treatment was administered from @ days before the expected calving date to the first @ days in milk .
Method	At @ days before the expected calving date , at calving , and @ days postpartum , body condition score ( BCS ) and concentrations in serum of reactive oxygen metabolites ( ROM ) , total antioxidant capacity ( OXY ) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) were evaluated .
Method	Bodyweight , milk production , and somatic cell count ( SCC ) were determined at @ , @ and @ days postpartum .
Result	The mean time of treatment prior to calving was @ ( min @ , max @ ) days .
Result	Compared with control cows , treatment increased energy corrected milk yield ( @ vs. @ ( SEM @ ) kg/day ; p = @ ) and milk fat yield ( @ vs. @ ( SEM @ ) kg/day ; p = @ ) over the first @ days of lactation .
Result	Treated cows had lower mean log@ SCC compared to control cows ( @ vs. @ ( SEM @ ) log@ cells/mL ) and had lower overall concentration of TBARS ( @ vs. @ ( SEM @ ) nM/mL ; p < @ ) , but similar concentrations of ROM and OXY in serum .
Result	However there was a treatment by time interaction ( p = @ ) for OXY , and at calving mean OXY was higher in treated cows compared with pre-calving values ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Despite the acknowledged limitation of the study , i.e. the small number of animals , our results suggest that silymarin and lycopene , as health-beneficial feed supplements , may help dairy cows in metabolic adaptation during the first stages of lactation .
Conclusion	During the peripartum period dairy cows suffer moderate-to-severe fatty liver and from an overproduction of free radicals .
Conclusion	The supplementation of a mixture of silymarin and lycopene during these stressful days may be useful to mitigate these metabolic disorders with beneficial effects on the subsequent lactation .

Background	Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke .
Background	However , few randomized clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy for these patients .
Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin ( combination therapy ) and aspirin alone ( monotherapy ) on neurologic deterioration , platelet activation , and other short-term outcomes in patients with acute large-artery atherosclerosis stroke .
Method	Altogether @ patients with acute ( @days ) large-artery atherosclerosis stroke were randomly assigned to receive either combined clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin alone .
Method	Platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte aggregation studies were performed at days @ and @ .
Method	Primary outcomes including recurrent ischemic stroke , neurologic deterioration , periphery vascular events , and myocardial infarction were monitored .
Method	Safety endpoints were hemorrhagic episodes and death .
Result	The prevalence of neurologic deterioration and recurrent ischemic stroke were lower in patients in the combination therapy group than in those of the monotherapy group ( @ % versus @ % and @ % versus @ % , respectively ) .
Result	At day @ of treatment , the platelet aggregations and platelet-leukocyte aggregates were lower in patients who were treated with clopidogrel and aspirin than in patients given aspirin alone ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	For patients with acute large-artery atherosclerosis stroke , treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin for @month provided significantly greater inhibition of platelet activity than aspirin alone .
Conclusion	Thus , dual therapy can be safer and more effective in reducing ischemic stroke recurrence and neurologic deterioration .

Background	The standard treatment , besides endocrine , targeted-therapy or chemotherapy , is the use of bisphosphonates .
Background	However , one of their main adverse side-effects is bisphosphonate-induced nephrotoxicity .
Background	The mechanism by which the latter occurs is not well-understood , although emerging evidence suggests that the effect of bisphosphonates on the kidney may differ between agents .
Method	The aim of this evaluation was to compare the renal toxicity of @ mg ibandronate i.v. versus @ mg zoledronic acid i.v. over a period of six months in women with breast cancer and bone metastases .
Method	A prospective randomized trial was carried out to examine specific kidney and other parameters ( @ - and @-microglobulin , albumin , @-macroglobulin , IgG and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) generated from spontaneous urine samples from @ patients of each group .
Result	We were unable to find any significant difference between the two treatment groups with regard to renal toxicity .
Result	All patients , independently of the applied bisphosphonate , experienced only temporary renal dysfunction without any evidence of irreversible damage in terms of acute nephrotoxicity during the study period .
Result	@-Microglobulin , a marker for proximal tubular damage , in particular , was not differently elevated in either group .
Conclusion	Both applied bisphosphonates were found to be well-tolerated and safe with regard to renal toxicity during a six-month treatment period in patients with otherwise healthy kidneys having advanced breast cancer and bone metastases .

Background	Maternal malnutrition and poor gestational weight gain are the most important causes of low birthweight and infant mortality in Bangladesh .
Problem	To assess the effect of short-term nutrition education on weight gain in the third trimester of pregnancy , birth outcomes , and breastfeeding .
Method	Three hundred pregnant women participated in this randomized , controlled trial during a @-month intervention period .
Method	The study was conducted in two antenatal clinics in urban Dhaka .
Method	One group of women was given monthly education sessions during the third trimester of pregnancy to promote consumption of khichuri , while the control group received only routine services from the health facilities .
Method	Birthweight was recorded within @ hours after delivery .
Method	Breastfeeding practices were observed for @ month after delivery .
Result	In the intervention group , maternal weight gain in the third trimester was @ % higher ( @ vs. @ kg , p = @ ) , mean birthweight was @ % higher ( @ vs. @ kg , p < @ ) , the rate of low birthweight was @ % lower ( @ % vs. @ % ; p < @ ) , and the rate of initiation of breastfeeding within @ hour after birth was @ % higher ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) , in comparison with the control group .
Result	Birthweight was associated with frequency of intake of khichuri ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Nutrition education with a focus on promoting consumption of khichuri during the third trimester of pregnancy significantly reduced the rate of low birthweight and increased maternal weight gain .

Problem	To assess potential of preoperative therapy with local steroid and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs ( SAIDs and NSAIDs ) for prolonging the hypotensive effect of trabeculectomy .
Method	A total of @ patients with primary open-angle glaucoma planed for trabeculectomy were randomized into @ groups of @ each : @ groups that differed in the studied drug ( nepafenac , dexamethasone , or their non-fixed combination ) and a control group with no preoperative therapy .
Method	The patients instilled @ drop of either drug b.i.d. for @ weeks before the surgery and were examined each day of the first week and then at weeks @ , @ , @ and months @ , @ , and @ .
Method	The rate of postoperative surgical and medical interventions ( needling , needling revision , hypotensive therapy ) was used for outcome evaluation .
Result	Postoperative needling was required in @ % of the controls , @ % of the NSAIDs and @ % of the SAIDs patients as well as @ % the combination-therapy patients .
Result	Needling revision had to be performed in @ % of patients from the control group and @ % of patients from the NSAIDs group .
Result	Patients from the steroid and combination-therapy groups had no need in needling procedure .
Result	Further hypotensive therapy was required in @ % of the control group , @ % of the NSAIDs group , @ % of the SAIDs group and @ % of the combination-therapy group .
Result	During the first postoperative year complete success of the treatment was achieved in @ % of the controls , @ % of the NSAIDs patients , @ % of the SAIDs patients , and @ % of those under combination therapy .
Result	Qualified success during the same period was achieved in @ % of cases .
Conclusion	Preoperative local anti-inflammatory therapy helped to increase the one-year complete success rate after trabeculectomy as compared with the controls .
Conclusion	The most significant hypotensive effect was noted in the combination-therapy group ( @ % ) , less significant -- in the steroid and non-steroid monotherapy groups ( @ % and @ % correspondingly ) .
Conclusion	A negative correlation was noted between the use of nepafenac and dexamethasone and other measures aimed at increasing the hypotensive effect of glaucoma surgery .

Background	Fish oil supplementation has been shown to alter gene expression of mononuclear cells both in vitro and in vivo .
Background	However , little is known about the total transcriptome profile in healthy subjects after intake of fish oil .
Background	We therefore investigated the gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) after intake of fish oil for @ weeks using transcriptome analyses .
Method	In a @-week , double-blinded , randomized , controlled , parallel-group study , healthy subjects received @ g day ( -@ ) fish oil ( @ g day ( -@ ) eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid ) ( n = @ ) or @ g day ( -@ ) high oleic sunflower oil ( n = @ ) .
Method	Microarray analyses of RNA isolated from PBMCs were performed at baseline and after @ weeks of intervention .
Result	Cell cycle , DNA packaging and chromosome organization are biological processes found to be upregulated after intake of fish oil compared to high oleic sunflower oil using a moderated t-test .
Result	In addition , gene set enrichment analysis identified several enriched gene sets after intake of fish oil .
Result	The genes contributing to the significantly different gene sets in the subjects given fish oil compared with the control group are involved in cell cycle , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and apoptosis .
Result	Gene transcripts with common motifs for @ known transcription factors including E@F , TP@ and ATF@ were upregulated after intake of fish oil .
Conclusion	We have shown that intake of fish oil for @ weeks modulates gene expression in PBMCs of healthy subjects .
Conclusion	The increased expression of genes related to cell cycle , ER stress and apoptosis suggests that intake of fish oil may modulate basic cellular processes involved in normal cellular function .

Problem	Survivors after cardiac arrest ( CA ) exhibits a systemic inflammatory response as part of post-cardiac arrest syndrome ( PCAS ) .
Problem	We investigated the association between systemic inflammation and severity of PCAS and whether level of targeted temperature management ( TTM ) modifies level of the inflammatory response .
Method	We studied @ patients included at a single center in the TTM-trial , randomly assigned to TTM at @ C or @ C for @ h. Plasma samples were analyzed for inflammatory markers including interleukin ( IL ) IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , IL-@ , tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and procalcitonin ( PCT ) at randomization and @ , @ and @ h after CA .
Method	Severity of PCAS was assessed by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score .
Result	Plasma levels of both IL-@ and IL-@ determined at randomization correlated with severity of PCAS at day @ ( r = @ and r = @ , p < @ ) and day @ ( r = @ and r = @ , p < @ ) .
Result	IL-@ at randomization was an independent predictor of severity of PCAS at day @ ( p = @ ) and day @ ( p < @ ) and was a significantly stronger predictor of severity of PCAS at day @ compared to CRP ( p = @ ) and PCT ( p = @ ) .
Result	Level of TTM did not modify level of the inflammatory markers IL-@ , IL-@ , TNF - , IL-@ , IL-@ , CRP and PCT , ( p = NS for each inflammatory marker ) .
Conclusion	Level of inflammatory response was associated with severity of PCAS with IL-@ being consistently and more strongly associated with severity of PCAS than the inflammatory markers CRP and PCT .
Conclusion	The systemic inflammatory response after CA was not modified by TTM at @ C or @ C.

Problem	In this study , our goal was to compare intraoperative and postoperative analgesic effects of lornoxicam and fentanyl when added to lidocaine Intravenous Regional Anesthesia ( IVRA ) in a group of outpatients who underwent hand surgery .
Method	This is a double blind randomized study .
Method	A total of @ patients were included , randomized into three groups .
Method	Patients in Group I ( L ) received @mg .
Method	kg ( -@ ) of @ % lidocaine @ mL ; patients in Group II ( LL ) received @mg .
Method	kg ( -@ ) lidocaine @ mL + @ mL lornoxicam ; patients in Group III ( LF ) received @mg .
Method	kg ( -@ ) lidocaine @ mL + @ mL fentanyl .
Method	Our primary outcome was first analgesic requirement time at postoperative period .
Result	Lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA increased the sensory block recovery time without increasing side effects and increased first analgesic requirement time at the postoperative period when compared to lidocaine IVRA ( p < @ , p < @ respectively ) and fentanyl added to lidocaine IVRA ( p < @ , p < @ respectively ) .
Result	In addition , we also found that fentanyl decreased tourniquet pain ( p < @ ) when compared to lidocaine but showed similar analgesic effect with lornoxicam ( p > @ ) although VAS scores related to tourniquet pain were lower in fentanyl group .
Result	Lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA was not superior to lidocaine IVRA in decreasing tourniquet pain .
Conclusion	Addition of fentanyl to lidocaine IVRA seems to be superior to lidocaine IVRA and lornoxicam added to lidocaine IVRA groups in decreasing tourniquet pain at the expense of increasing side effects .
Conclusion	However , lornoxicam did not increase side effects while providing intraoperative and postoperative analgesia .
Conclusion	Therefore , lornoxicam could be more appropriate for clinical use .

Problem	Opportunistic brief in-person emergency department ( ED ) interventions can be effective at reducing hazardous alcohol use in young adult drinkers , but require resources frequently unavailable .
Problem	Mobile telephone text messaging ( short message service -LSB- SMS -RSB- ) could sustainably deliver behavioral support to young adult patients , but efficacy remains unknown .
Problem	We report @-month outcome data of a randomized controlled trial testing a novel SMS-delivered intervention in hazardous-drinking young adults .
Method	We randomized @ young adult ED patients who screened positive for past hazardous alcohol use to one of @ groups : SMS assessments + feedback ( SA+F ) intervention who were asked to respond to drinking-related queries and received real-time feedback through SMS each Thursday and Sunday for @ weeks ( n = @ ) , SMS assessments ( SA ) who were asked to respond to alcohol consumption queries each Sunday but did not receive any feedback ( N = @ ) , and a control group who did not participate in any SMS ( n = @ ) .

Conclusion	Single lobaplatin can be as a chemotherapy drug in TACE and has better efficiency in the aspects of mean survival time and therapeutic response , deserving to be popularized in the clinic .

Background	An increased production of oxidizing species related to reactive oral diseases , such as chronic apical periodontitis , could have systemic implications such as an increase in cardiovascular morbidity .
Background	Based on this consideration , we conducted a prospective study to assess whether subjects affected by chronic periodontitis presented with higher values of oxidative stress than reference values before endodontic treatment , and whether endodontic treatment can reduce the oxidative imbalance and bring it back to normal in these subjects .
Method	The authors recruited @ groups of patients from private studies and dental clinics : these patients were recruited randomly .
Method	The oxidative balance in both patients with chronic apical periodontitis ( CAP ) and healthy control patients was determined by measuring the oxidant status , using an identification of the reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs ) test , while the antioxidant status in these patients was determined using a biological antioxidant potential ( BAP ) test .
Method	Both these tests were carried on plasma samples taken from enrolled patients .
Method	Values were measured both before the endodontic treatment of the patients with chronic apical periodontitis , and @ and @ days after treatment , and compared to those obtained from healthy control patients .
Result	It was found that , on recruitment , the patients with chronic apical periodontitis exhibited significantly higher levels of oxidative stress than control patients , as determined by the d-ROMs and BAP tests .
Result	Furthermore , the d-ROMs test values were shown to decrease and the BAP test values to increase over time in patients with chronic apical periodontitis following endodontic therapy .
Result	As the levels of oxidative stress in these patients tended to reduce and return to normal by @ days following treatment .
Conclusion	This study has demonstrated a positive association between chronic apical periodontitis and oxidative stress .
Conclusion	Subjects affected by chronic apical periodontitis are exposed to a condition of oxidative stress , which is extremely dangerous to general health .
Conclusion	Moreover , one can infer from these findings that through proper endodontic therapy , a good oxidative balance can be restored , thereby avoiding the risk of contracting the abovementioned diseases .

Problem	The benefit of adding sciatic nerve block ( SNB ) to femoral nerve block to improve analgesia after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is uncertain .
Problem	We hypothesized that the effective duration of single-injection SNB is too short to improve postoperative analgesia and that this contributes to conflicting results on the efficacy of SNB after TKA .
Problem	We evaluated this hypothesis in a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial .
Method	Sixty patients undergoing TKA were randomly allocated to a continuous SNB group or a single-injection SNB group .
Method	All patients received femoral nerve block ( @ % ropivacaine @ mL ) and SNB ( @ % ropivacaine @ mL ) and catheters were inserted into both peripheral nerve block sites before surgery .
Method	Both groups received continuous femoral nerve block and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine .
Method	Continuous SNB ( @ % ropivacaine @ mL/h ; continuous SNB group ) or sham continuous SNB ( @ % normal saline @ mL/h ; single-injection SNB group ) was provided after surgery .
Method	The primary outcome was total morphine consumption for @ hours after surgery .
Result	Total morphine consumption in the @-hour period after surgery was significantly lower in the continuous SNB group compared with the single-injection SNB group -LSB- @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) mg , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	Visual analog scale pain scores at rest were also significantly lower in the continuous SNB group ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The combination of continuous femoral and SNB provides a superior opioid sparing effect and improves analgesia after TKA .

Background	Roflumilast reduces exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Background	Its effect in patients using fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and longacting @ agonists is unknown .
Background	We postulated that roflumilast would reduce exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at risk for exacerbations , even in combination with inhaled corticosteroid and longacting @ agonist treatment .
Method	For this @-year double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicentre , phase @-@ trial , the Roflumilast and Exacerbations in patients receiving Appropriate Combination Therapy ( REACT ) study , we enrolled patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from @ centres ( outpatient clinics , hospitals , specialised pulmonologists , and family doctors ) in @ countries .
Method	Eligible patients were @ years of age or older with a smoking history of at least @ pack-years and a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe airflow limitation , symptoms of chronic bronchitis , and at least two exacerbations in the previous year .
Method	We used a computerised central randomisation system to randomly assign patients in a @:@ ratio to the two treatment groups : roflumilast @ g or placebo given orally once daily together with a fixed inhaled corticosteroid and longacting @ agonist combination .
Method	Background tiotropium treatment was allowed .
Method	All patients and investigators were masked to group assignment .
Method	The primary outcome was the rate of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient per year , analysed by intention to treat .
Method	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	Between April @ , @ , and May @ , @ , we enrolled @ eligible participants and randomly assigned @ to the roflumilast group and @ to the placebo group .
Result	The rate of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations was @ % lower in the roflumilast group than in the placebo group according to a Poisson regression analysis ( roflumilast @ vs placebo @ ; rate ratio -LSB- RR -RSB- @ -LSB- @ % CI @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) , and @ % lower according to a predefined sensitivity analysis using negative binomial regression ( @ vs @ ; @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	Adverse events were reported by @ ( @ % ) of @ patients receiving roflumilast and by @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the placebo group ; adverse event-associated patient withdrawal from the study was also more common in the roflumilast group ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) than in the placebo group ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
Result	The most frequently reported serious adverse events were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and pneumonia , and @ ( @ % ) deaths occurred in the roflumilast group compared with @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group .
Conclusion	Our findings suggest that roflumilast reduces exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis who are at risk of frequent and severe exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid and longacting @ agonist therapy , even in combination with tiotropium .

Background	Sample size calculations for treatment trials that aim to assess health-related quality-of-life ( HRQOL ) outcomes are often difficult to perform .
Background	Researchers must select a target minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) in HRQOL for the trial , estimate the effect size of the intervention , and then consider the responsiveness of different HRQOL measures for detecting improvements .
Background	Generic preference-based HRQOL measures are usually less sensitive to gains in HRQOL than are disease-specific measures , but are nonetheless recommended to quantify an impact on HRQOL that can be translated into quality-adjusted life-years during cost-effectiveness analyses .
Background	Mapping disease-specific measures onto generic measures is a proposed method for yielding more efficient sample size requirements while retaining the ability to generate utility weights for cost-effectiveness analyses .
Problem	This study sought to test this mapping strategy to calculate and compare the effect on sample size of three different methods .
Method	Three different methods were used for determining an MCID in HRQOL in patients with incontinence : @ ) a global rating of improvement , @ ) an incontinence-specific HRQOL instrument , and @ ) a generic preference-based HRQOL instrument using mapping coefficients .
Result	The sample size required to detect a @ % difference in the MCID for the global rating of improvement was @ per trial arm , @ per arm for the incontinence-specific HRQOL outcome , and @ per arm for the generic preference-based HRQOL outcome .
Conclusion	We caution that treatment trials of conditions for which improvements are not easy to measure on generic HRQOL instruments will still require significantly greater sample size even when mapping functions are used to try to gain efficiency .

Background	That patients with acute radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc herniation ( LDH ) will benefit from spinal manipulation ( SM ) treatment has been taken for granted , despite no solid evidence to support that claim .
Background	There is a demand for a win-win SM treatment that is both effective and less risky , and we attempt to use this trial to demonstrate such a treatment .
Background	In this study , Feng 's Spinal Manipulative Therapy ( FSM ) is selected as the observational SM .
Background	FSM can be performed with either manipulation or mobilization , and also can be easily mimicked as a sham SM .
Method	Two hundred and sixteen qualified hospitalized participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three following groups : sham SM , mobilization , or manipulation , according to a ratio of @:@:@ .
Method	Participants in each group will receive specific FSM treatments four times , along with basic therapies over a course of @ weeks .
Method	Two days after each SM appointment , risk outcomes will be assessed using a questionnaire developed to identify accompanying unpleasant reactions ( AUR ) .
Method	The pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) will be measured paraspinally on the tender spot beside the involved joint before and immediately after each SM treatment .
Method	Relative risk ( RR ) of AUR , number needed to harm ( NNH ) and the @ % confidence intervals of each group will be calculated and compared .
Method	Benefit outcomes will be assessed by analyzing the following data recordings : the Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , and Global Perceived Effect ( GPE ) before enrollment and at the @th , and @th day after the treatment .
Method	Analyses will include comparisons of NRS , ODI and changes at the different visit times among the three groups by Repeated Measures Data ANOVA , an evaluation of reduced scores of NRS and ODI after the therapy to determine if they meet the minimum acceptable outcome ( MAO ) , and the determination of the minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) by the average improvement in NRS and ODI scores of all participants who have been allocated to the category ` improved ' on the GPE assessment .

Problem	Ischemic heart disease is a leading worldwide cause of death .
Problem	The Seattle Post Myocardial Infarction Model ( SPIM ) was developed to predict survival @ months to @ years after an acute myocardial infarction with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction .
Result	A total of @ subjects from the EPHESUS trial were used to derive the predictive model , while @ subjects from the OPTIMAAL trial were used to validate the model .
Result	Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to develop a multivariate risk score predictive of all-cause mortality .
Result	The SPIM risk score integrated lab and vital parameters , Killip class , reperfusion or revascularization , the number of cardiac evidence-based medicines ( aspirin , statin , blocker , ACEI/ARB , aldosterone blocker ) , and the number of cardiac risk factors .
Result	The model was predictive of all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction , with an AUC of @ at @ months and @ at @ years in the derivation cohort and @ and @ for the same time points in the validation cohort .
Result	Model predicted versus Kaplan-Meier observed survival was excellent in the derivation cohort .
Result	It remained so in the validation cohort -- @ % versus @ % at @ years .
Result	The @ % of subjects with the highest predicted risk had approximately @ times higher mortality at @ years than the @ % of subjects with the lowest predicted risk .
Conclusion	The SPIM score was a powerful predictor of outcomes after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction .
Conclusion	Its highly accurate predictions should improve patient and physician understanding of survival and may prove a useful tool in post-infarct risk stratification .

Background	Fibrates were found to reduce cytokine release and low-grade inflammation in patients with impaired glucose tolerance .
Background	The aim of this study was to investigate whether these effects of fibrates may be potentiated by metformin treatment .
Method	The study included @ patients with isolated impaired glucose tolerance and normal plasma lipids who had been treated for at least @ months with micronized fenofibrate ( @ mg daily ) .
Method	These subjects were randomly assigned to @ weeks ' treatment with either high dose metformin ( @ g daily in three divided doses ) or placebo .
Method	Plasma lipids , glucose homeostasis markers , monocyte cytokine release and plasma C-reactive protein levels were determined before randomization and at the end of the treatment .
Result	Metformin treatment reduced plasma C-reactive protein levels and monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor - and interleukin-@ , as well as tended to reduce monocyte release of interleukin-@ and monocyte chemoattractant protein-@ , which was accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
Conclusion	Our results show that high-dose metformin produces monocyte-suppressing and systemic anti-inflammatory effects in fibrate-treated patients with isolated impaired glucose tolerance .
Conclusion	This suggests that fibrate-metformin combination therapy may bring clinical benefits to impaired glucose tolerance patients at high cardiovascular risk .

Background	This multi-center , phase III trial assesses the efficacy of daikenchuto ( TU-@ ) on gastrointestinal disorders after hepatic resection ( UMIN Registration No. @ ) .
Method	A total of @ patients , who underwent hepatic resection at @ Japanese centers , were enrolled .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral doses ( @ g/day , three times a day ) of TU-@ or placebo control from preoperative day @ to postoperative day @ , except on the day of surgery .
Method	Primary end points were the time from extubation until the first postoperative bowel movement ( FBM-T ) , serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and ammonia levels .
Result	Finally , @ patients ( TU-@ : n = @ , placebo : n = @ ) were included in the statistical analysis .
Result	The median FBM-T was @ h ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the TU-@ group and @ h ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the placebo group , demonstrating that TU-@ accelerated the time to first bowel movement significantly more than placebo control .
Result	Serum CRP levels did not differ significantly during the study period , although serum CRP levels in the TU-@ group tended to be lower than those in the placebo group in patients with grade B liver damage .
Result	Meanwhile , the two groups had similar serum ammonia levels .
Result	TU-@-related serious adverse events did not occur during the study .
Conclusion	TU-@ appears to improve gastrointestinal dysmotility and reduce serum CRP levels in patients with grade B liver damage after hepatectomy .
Conclusion	TU-@ is an effective treatment option after hepatic resection in patients with liver cancer .

Background	The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented .
Background	However , due to relapse rates and side effects , hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option .
Background	The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone , as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness .
Method	We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified @-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at @ and @ weeks post-hospitalization .
Method	Patients ( n = @ ) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups : NRT for @ days ( NRT ; n = @ ) , a @-min hypnotherapy session ( H ; n = @ ) , and NRT with hypnotherapy ( HNRT ; n = @ ) .
Method	Treatment groups were compared to a `` self-quit '' group of @ patients who refused intervention .
Result	Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at @ weeks ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) and @ weeks after hospitalization ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
Result	Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group .
Result	There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at @ weeks between `` self quit '' and participants in any of the treatment groups .
Result	In multivariable regression analysis adjusting for diagnosis and demographic characteristics , H and HNRT were over three times more likely than NRT participants to abstain at @-weeks post-discharge ( RR = @ ; p = @ and RR = @ ; p = @ , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Hypnotherapy is more effective than NRT in improving smoking abstinence in patients hospitalized for a smoking-related illness , and could be an asset to post-discharge smoking cessation programs .

Background	Abstinence from chronic cocaine use is associated with abnormal sleep architecture .
Background	As sleep abnormalities are associated with clinical outcome in alcohol dependence , we hypothesized a similar relationship in cocaine dependence .
Method	We report data from a cocaine self-administration study ( N = @ ) and the placebo arm of a randomized clinical trial ( N = @ ) .
Method	Self-administration participants underwent three cocaine self-administration sessions during a three-week inpatient stay .
Method	Treatment participants underwent two weeks of inpatient followed by six weeks of outpatient treatment including once-weekly cognitive behavioral therapy .
Method	Measurements included polysomnography from early and late in abstinence during the inpatient stays .
Method	Clinical outcomes included amount of cocaine self-administered , urine tests , and self-reported use and withdrawal symptoms .
Result	Change in slow-wave sleep from early to late abstinence ( SWS ; p = @ ) , late abstinence rapid eye movement sleep ( REM ; p = @ ) , and late abstinence total sleep time ( p = @ ) were negatively correlated with the amount of cocaine self-administered .
Result	Early abstinence REM was positively correlated with withdrawal symptoms ( p = @ ) .
Result	Late abstinence REM was positively correlated with percent negative urines and maximum consecutive number of days abstinent ( both p < @ ) .
Result	SWS was positively correlated with percent negative urines ( p = @ ) and participants with increased SWS had greater percent negative urines ( p = @ ) and maximum consecutive number of days abstinent ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Correlations between sleep deficits and amount of cocaine self-administered , clinical outcomes , and severity of withdrawal symptoms underscore the relevance of sleep in clinical outcomes in the treatment of cocaine dependence .

Problem	Cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) causes significant morbidity in a delayed fashion .
Problem	The authors recently published a new scale that grades the maximum thickness of SAH on axial CT and is predictive of vasospasm incidence .
Problem	In this study , the authors further investigate whether different aneurysm locations result in different SAH clot burdens and whether any concurrent differences in ruptured aneurysm location and maximum SAH clot burden affect vasospasm incidence .
Method	Two hundred fifty patients who were part of a prospective randomized controlled trial were reviewed .
Method	Most outcome and demographic variables were included as part of the prospective randomized controlled trial .
Method	Additional variables were also collected at a later time , including vasospasm data and maximum clot thickness .
Result	Aneurysms were categorized into @ of @ groups : intradural internal carotid artery aneurysms , vertebral artery ( VA ) aneurysms ( including the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ) , basilar trunk or basilar apex aneurysms , middle cerebral artery aneurysms , pericallosal aneurysms , and anterior communicating artery aneurysms .
Result	Twenty-nine patients with nonaneurysmal SAH were excluded .
Result	Patients with pericallosal aneurysms had the least average maximum clot burden ( @ mm ) , compared with @ mm for the group overall , but had the highest rate of symptomatic vasospasm ( @ % vs @ % overall , OR @ , RR @ , p = @ ) .
Result	Symptomatic vasospasm occurrence was tallied in patients with clinical deterioration attributable to delayed cerebral ischemia .
Result	There were no significant differences in maximum clot thickness between aneurysm sites .
Result	Middle cerebral artery aneurysms resulted in the thickest mean maximum clot ( @ mm ) but rates of symptomatic and radiographic vasospasm in this group were statistically no different compared with the overall group .
Result	Vertebral artery aneurysms had the worst @-year modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) scores ( @ vs @ overall , respectively ; p = @ ) .
Result	A @-year mRS score of @-@ ( good outcome ) was found in @ % of patients overall , but in only @ % of those with pericallosal and VA aneurysms , and in @ % of those with basilar artery aneurysms ( p = @ ) .
Result	Patients with stroke from vasospasm had higher mean clot thickness ( @ vs @ mm , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The location of a ruptured aneurysm minimally affects the maximum thickness of the SAH clot but is predictive of symptomatic vasospasm or clinical deterioration from delayed cerebral ischemia in pericallosal aneurysms .
Conclusion	The worst @-year mRS outcomes in this cohort of patients were noted in those with posterior circulation aneurysms or pericallosal artery aneurysms .
Conclusion	Patients experiencing stroke had higher mean clot burden .

Background	In our hospital , lumbar epidural analgesia had been used for postoperative analgesia following vaginal total hysterectomy ( VTH ) .
Background	But some patients experienced severe abdominal pain or numbness of the legs .
Background	Therefore we planned a randomized prospective study to compare lower thoracic epidural analgesia and lumbar epidural analgesia following VTH .
Method	Fifty patients were allocated to two groups : those who received lower thoracic epidural analgesia ( T group ) and the other who received lumbar epidural analgesia ( L group ) .
Method	Both groupsreceived the same continuous epidural analgesia using fentanyl and ropivacaine after the operation .
Result	The T group required significantly lower frequency of analgesic agents compared with that of the L group ( @ times vs. @ times , P < @ ) .
Result	Fewer patients in the T group had felt numbness in their legs compared to the L group ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Lower thoracic epidural analgesia is more effective to provide postoperative analgesic effect following VTH compared with lumbar epidural analgesia .

Problem	To compare the analgesic efficacy of @ types of anesthetic techniques-topical and topical associated with cryoanalgesia-during cataract surgery .
Method	Department of Ophthalmology , University of So Paulo , Ribeiro Preto , Brazil .
Method	Prospective randomized study .
Method	Patients with symmetrical bilateral cataract had phacoemulsification with the use of an intraocular irrigation solution at room temperature in @ eye and a cold ( @C ) solution in the contralateral eye ( Group @ ) .
Method	The pain related to the procedure was assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from @ to @ , with @ representing no pain and @ the worst pain .
Method	In addition , endothelial cell loss , the change in corneal thickness , and visual acuity were evaluated @ days @ ( SD ) after each surgery .
Method	The surgery duration , total irrigation volume , phacoemulsification time , and ultrasound power used were analyzed .
Result	The study enrolled @ patients ( @ eyes ) .
Result	There was no statistically significant difference in the mean pain score between Group @ ( @ @ ) and Group @ ( @ @ ) ( P = @ , paired t test ) .
Result	No significant difference was found in the mean corneal endothelial cell loss ( Group @ : @ % @ % ; Group @ : @ % @ % ; P = @ ) , corneal thickness increase ( Group @ : @ @ m ; Group @ : @ @ m ; P = @ ) , or visual acuity gain ( Group @ : @ @ logMAR ; Group @ : @ @ logMAR ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	There is no difference in the intensity of pain during phacoemulsification with the use of topical anesthesia or topical anesthesia associated with cryoanalgesia .

Background	Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) worldwide .
Background	Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type @ diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD .
Background	We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type @ diabetes and CKD .
Method	We did a phase @ , randomised , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled trial at @ centres in @ countries .
Method	Patients with HbA@c of @ % or greater to @ % or less were eligible for inclusion .
Method	Patients with stage @ CKD ( estimated glomerular filtration rate -LSB- eGFR -RSB- @ to < @ mL/min per @ m ( @ ) ; n = @ ) were randomly assigned ( @:@:@ ) to receive empagliflozin @ mg or @ mg or placebo once daily for @ weeks .
Method	Patients with stage @ CKD ( eGFR @ to < @ mL/min per @ m ( @ ) ; n = @ ) were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive empagliflozin @ mg or placebo for @ weeks .
Method	Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment , HbA@c , and background antidiabetes medication .
Method	Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators .
Method	The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA@c at week @ by ANCOVA in the full analysis set .
Method	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	In patients with stage @ CKD , adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA@c at week @ were -@ % ( @ % CI -@ to -@ ) for empagliflozin @ mg and -@ % ( -@ to -@ ) for empagliflozin @ mg ( both p < @ ) .
Result	In patients with stage @ CKD , adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA@c at week @ was -@ % ( -@ to -@ ) for empagliflozin @ mg ( p < @ ) .
Result	In patients with stage @ CKD , adverse events were reported over @ weeks by @ patients ( @ % ) on placebo ( @ severe -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ serious -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) , @ ( @ % ) on empagliflozin @ mg ( six severe -LSB- @ % -RSB- and six serious -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) and @ ( @ % ) on empagliflozin @ mg ( eight severe -LSB- @ % -RSB- and seven serious -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
Result	In patients with stage @ CKD , adverse events were reported over @ weeks by @ patients ( @ % ) on placebo ( @ severe -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ serious -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) and @ ( @ % ) on empagliflozin @ mg ( @ severe -LSB- @ % -RSB- and @ serious -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
Conclusion	In patients with type @ diabetes and stage @ or @ CKD , empagliflozin reduced HbA@c and was well tolerated .
Conclusion	However , our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type @ diabetes and renal impairment .

Problem	Although many attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) care models have been studied , few have demonstrated individual-level symptom improvement .
Problem	We sought to test whether complementing basic collaborative care with interventions that address common reasons for symptom persistence improves outcomes for children with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity .
Method	We conducted a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of @ care management systems for @ - to @-year-old children being evaluated for ADHD ( n = @ ) .
Method	All participants received care management with decision support .
Method	Care managers in the enhanced care arm also were trained in motivational and parent management techniques to help parents engage in their child 's treatment , address their own mental health needs , and manage challenging child behaviors .
Method	We used multivariable models to assess inattention , hyperactivity/impulsivity , oppositionality , and social skills over @ year .
Result	Both treatment arms generated guideline concordant diagnostic processes in @ % of cases ; @ % of children had presentations consistent with ADHD .
Result	For the entire sample , there were no differences in symptom trajectories between study arms ; mean differences in change scores at @ months were -@ ( @ % confidence interval -@ to @ ) for inattention ; -@ ( -@ to @ ) for hyperactivity/impulsivity ; -@ ( -@ to @ ) for oppositionality ; and @ ( -@ to @ ) for social skills .
Result	Among children with ADHD-consistent presentations , enhanced arm participants experienced superior change scores for hyperactivity/impulsivity of -@ ( -@ to -@ ) , oppositionality -@ ( -@ to -@ ) , and social skills @ ( @ to @ ) .
Conclusion	Among children with ADHD-consistent presentations , addressing barriers to engagement with care and challenging child behaviors has potential to improve the effectiveness of collaborative care .

Background	Evolocumab ( AMG @ ) , a monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type @ ( PCSK@ ) , significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in phase @ studies of @ weeks ' duration .
Background	The longer-term efficacy and safety of PCSK@ inhibition remain undefined .
Result	Of @ randomized and dosed patients in the @ evolocumab phase @ parent studies , @ ( @ % ) elected to enroll into the Open-Label Study of Long-term Evaluation Against LDL-C ( OSLER ) study .
Result	Regardless of their treatment assignment in the parent study , patients were randomized @:@ to receive either open-label subcutaneous evolocumab @ mg every @ weeks with standard of care ( SOC ) ( evolocumab + SOC , n = @ ) or SOC alone ( n = @ ) .
Result	Ninety-two percent of patients in the evolocumab + SOC group and @ % of patients in the SOC group completed @ weeks of follow-up .
Result	Patients who first received evolocumab in OSLER experienced a mean @ % -LSB- SE , @ % -RSB- reduction in LDL-C at week @ ( P < @ ) .
Result	Patients who received @ of @ dosing regimens of evolocumab in the parent studies and received evolocumab + SOC in OSLER had persistent LDL-C reductions ( mean reduction , @ % -LSB- SE , @ % -RSB- at the end of the parent study versus @ % -LSB- SE , @ % -RSB- at @ weeks ; P = @ ) .
Result	In patients who discontinued evolocumab on entry into OSLER , LDL-C levels returned to near baseline levels .
Result	Adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in @ % and @ % of the evolocumab + SOC group patients and @ % and @ % of the SOC group patients , respectively .
Conclusion	Evolocumab dosed every @ weeks demonstrated continued efficacy and encouraging safety and tolerability over @ year of treatment in the largest and longest evaluation of a PCSK@ inhibitor in hypercholesterolemic patients to date .

Problem	Surgical resection enhances long-term survival after lung cancer , but survivors face functional deficits and report on poor quality of life long time after surgery .
Problem	This study evaluated short and long-term effects of supervised group exercise training on health-related quality of life and physical performance in patients , who were radically operated for lung cancer .
Method	A randomized , assessor-blinded , controlled trial was performed on @ patients undergoing lung cancer surgery .
Method	The intervention group ( IG , n = @ ) participated in supervised out-patient exercise training sessions , one hour once a week for ten weeks .
Method	The sessions were based on aerobic exercises with target intensity of @-@ % of work capacity , resistance training and dyspnoea management .
Method	The control group ( CG , n = @ ) received one individual instruction in exercise training .
Method	Measurements consisted of : health-related quality of life ( SF@ ) , six minute walk test ( @MWT ) and lung function ( spirometry ) , assessed three weeks after surgery and after four and twelve months .
Result	Both groups were comparable at baseline on demographic characteristic and outcome values .
Result	We found a statistically significant effect after four months in the bodily pain domain of SF@ , with an estimated mean difference ( EMD ) of @ ( @ % CI :@ to @ , p = @ ) and a trend in favour of the intervention for role physical functioning ( EMD @ , @ % CI : -@ to @ , p = @ ) and physical component summary ( EMD @ , @ % CI : -@ to @ , p = @ ) .
Result	At @ months , the tendency was reversed , with the CG presenting overall slightly better measures .
Result	We found no effect of the intervention on @MWT or lung volumes at any time-point .
Conclusion	Supervised compared to unsupervised exercise training resulted in no improvement in health-related quality of life , except for the bodily pain domain , four months after lung cancer surgery .
Conclusion	No effects of the intervention were found for any outcome after one year .

Problem	To investigate the effect of overnight orthokeratology ( OK ) contact lens wear on axial length growth in East Asian children with progressive myopia .
Method	A prospective , randomized , contralateral-eye crossover study conducted over a @-year period .
Method	We enrolled @ myopic children ( age range , @-@ @ years ) of East Asian ethnicity .
Method	Subjects were fitted with overnight OK in @ eye , chosen at random , and conventional rigid gas-permeable ( GP ) lenses for daytime wear in the contralateral eye .
Method	Lenses were worn for @ months .
Method	After a @-week recovery period without lens wear , lens-eye combinations were reversed and lens wear was continued for a further @ months , followed by another @-week recovery period without lens wear .
Method	Axial eye length was monitored at baseline and every @ months using an IOLMaster biometer .
Method	Corneal topography ( Medmont E@ ) and objective refraction ( Shin-Nippon NVision-K @ autorefractor ) were also measured to confirm that OK lens wear was efficacious in correcting myopia .
Method	Axial length elongation and myopia progression with OK were compared with conventional daytime rigid contact lens wear .
Result	After @ months of lens wear , axial length had increased by @ mm ( meanstandard deviation ) in the GP eye ( P = @ ) but showed no change ( -@ mm ) in the OK eye ( P = @ ) .
Result	During the second @-month phase of lens wear , in the OK eye there was no change from baseline in axial length at @ months ( -@ mm ; P = @ ) .
Result	However , in the GP eye , the @-month increase in axial length was significant ( @ mm ; P < @ ) .
Result	The GP lens-wearing eye showed progressive axial length growth throughout the study .
Conclusion	These results provide evidence that , at least in the initial months of lens wear , overnight OK inhibits axial eye growth and myopia progression compared with conventional GP lenses .
Conclusion	Apparent shortening of axial length early in OK lens wear may reflect the contribution of OK-induced central corneal thinning , combined with choroidal thickening or recovery due to a reduction or neutralization of the myopiogenic stimulus to eye growth in these myopic children .

Problem	To assess the effect of dimeticone and pepsin on the bioavailability of metoclopramide ( CAS @-@-@ ) in healthy volunteers .
Method	The study was conducted using a randomized , open , @-period crossover design .
Method	The volunteers received single administration of @-mg conventional metoclopramide capsule and a formulation containing metoclopramide ( @mg ) plus dimeticone ( @mg ) and pepsin ( @mg ) , with a @-day interval between treatments .
Method	Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and during @h post-treatment .
Method	Plasma metoclopramide concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) .
Method	The pharmacokinetics parameters AUC ( last ) and C ( max ) were obtained from the metoclopramide plasma concentration vs. time curves .
Result	Metoclopramide 's association was bioequivalent to conventional capsule ; @ % CIs for geometric mean treatment ratios of C ( max ) -LSB- @ % ( @ % CI , @-@ @ % ) -RSB- , AUC ( last ) -LSB- @ % ( @ % CI , @-@ @ % ) -RSB- were within the predefined range .
Result	The metoclopramide formulations were well tolerated at the administered doses and no significant adverse reactions were observed .
Result	Thus , these results confirm the good bioavailability of metoclopramide in the new formulation and rule out any impaired absorption when the drugs are formulated in combination .

Background	Anatomical suitability for arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) formation was formerly determined by clinical examination alone .
Background	There are potential benefits from imaging to assess anatomical suitability .
Background	Existing studies examined the role of routine preoperative ultrasonography versus clinical examination alone .
Background	The role of a selective duplex ultrasound imaging policy is unknown .
Background	This study aimed to compare a policy of selective versus routine ultrasound assessment before AVF formation .
Method	All patients referred for fistula formation were assessed for inclusion .
Method	Suitable patients were randomized to either routine or selective preoperative ultrasound imaging ; selective imaging was performed only when clinical criteria were not met .
Method	The primary outcome measures were site of AVF formation and @-day primary failure rate , and secondary outcome measures included the rate of complications .
Result	A total of @ patients were assessed , and @ were randomized : @ to selective and @ to routine duplex ultrasonography .
Result	The groups were well matched for age , co-morbidities and medications .
Result	The primary failure rate ( @ per cent overall ) was not significantly different between the selective and routine imaging groups : @ per cent ( @ of @ ) and @ per cent ( @ of @ ) respectively ( P = @ ) .
Result	There were no significant differences in the sites of AVF formation or complication rates .
Conclusion	Routine preoperative ultrasound vessel imaging did not significantly reduce early failure rates , influence the site of AVF formation or reduce complications .
Conclusion	If clinical evaluation detects anatomy suitable for AVF formation , duplex imaging may not be needed .

Problem	To evaluate efficacy , safety , and tolerability efinaconazole topical solution , @ % in diabetic patients with onychomycosis .
Method	A post-hoc analysis of @ patients , aged @-@ years , randomized to receive efinaconazole topical solution , @ % or vehicle from two identical multicenter , double-blind , vehicle-controlled @-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy .
Method	The primary end point was complete cure rate ( @ % clinical involvement of target toenail , and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture ) at week @ .
Result	Mycologic cure rates ( OC ) were significantly greater with efinaconazole ( @ % and @ % in diabetic and non-diabetic patients respectively ) compared to vehicle ( P = @ and P < @ , respectively ) .
Result	The primary end point , complete cure , was also greater for efinaconazole ( @ % and @ % , respectively vs @ % and @ % ) .
Result	Treatment success ( percent affected target toenail @ % ) for efinaconazole was @ % and @ % , respectively vs @ % and @ % with vehicle .
Result	There was no statistically significant difference between the diabetic and non-diabetic populations for any efficacy endpoint .
Result	Adverse events associated with efinaconazole were local site reactions and clinically similar to vehicle .
Conclusion	Once daily efinaconazole topical solution , @ % may provide a useful topical option in the treatment of diabetic patients with onychomycosis .

Problem	To determine whether tumor grade , molecular subtype and hypoxia predict response to hypofractionated versus standard radiotherapy ( RT ) following breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) for node-negative breast cancer in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) .
Method	Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor blocks were available on @ of @ patients enrolled in the Hypofractionation Whole Breast Irradiation ( HWBI ) Trial .
Method	A central pathology review and assessment of tumor grade using the Nottingham grading system was carried out .
Method	Tumors were classified by molecular subtype as luminal A , luminal B , HER@ enriched , basal-like or unclassified using a six-biomarker panel ; ER , PR , HER-@ , Ki@ , CK@/@ and EGFR .
Method	Tumors were also classified as hypoxic based on the expression of HIF@ , CAIX or GLUT-@ .
Method	The primary end point was local recurrence ( LR ) .
Result	Median follow-up was @ years .
Result	In the multivariable Cox model , molecular subtype was the only factor predictive of LR , the @-year cumulative incidence was @ % for luminal A and basal-like , @ % for luminal B and @ % for HER-@ enriched tumors ( P < @ ) .
Result	Tumor grade , molecular subtype or hypoxia did not predict response to hypofractionation .
Conclusion	In women enrolled in the HWBI trial following BCS tumor molecular subtype predicted LR .
Conclusion	However tumor grade , molecular subtype and hypoxia did not predict response to hypofractionation suggesting that patients with node-negative breast tumors of all grades and molecular subtypes may be safely treated with hypofractionated RT regimens .

Background	Indigenous Australian youth ( aged @ to @ ) have up to four times the risk of suicide compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts .
Background	Barriers to help-seeking include shame , feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes towards healthcare providers .
Background	The use of mobile devices and apps continues to rise amongst young people , thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids in overcoming help-seeking barriers .
Background	Apps have been shown to assist in several health-related areas , including weight loss and smoking cessation , although no apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention .
Background	Moreover , there is a lack of research that scientifically evaluates suicide prevention interventions within Indigenous communities .
Method	In this study , a recently developed self-help app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial .
Method	The intervention is based on acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy .
Method	It is aimed at participants who have suicidal thoughts but who are not actively suicidal .
Method	In total , @ participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition ( N = @ ) or to the wait-list control condition ( N = @ ) .
Method	Questionnaires will be completed at baseline , post-test and @ weeks follow-up .
Method	The primary outcome measure is a reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts .
Method	Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of depression , anxiety and impulsivity .
Conclusion	This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help app for suicidal thoughts amongst young Indigenous people .
Conclusion	Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed .

Background	The current study was conducted to investigate the dependence between progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) and to explore whether PFS can be used as an intermediate endpoint of OS in this patient population .
Method	A total of @ patients from @ prospective phase @ trials ( Cancer and Leukemia Group B -LSB- CALGB -RSB- @ and AVOREN ) of interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab were analyzed .
Method	Both trials recruited previously untreated patients with clear cell mRCC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of @ to @ ; adequate bone marrow , hepatic , cardiac , and renal function ; and controlled blood pressure .
Method	The CALGB study served as the training data set , and the AVOREN study served as the testing data set .
Method	The dependence between PFS and OS was investigated using the Kendall tau for bivariate time-to-event endpoints .
Result	In the training data set , the median OS times among patients who experienced progressive disease at @ months or @ months were @ months and @ months , respectively , compared with @ months and @ months , respectively , ( P < @ ) in patients who did not develop disease progress .
Result	The adjusted hazard ratios ( HR ) were @ ( P < @ ) and @ ( P < @ ) , respectively , for patients who did and did not progress at @ months or @ months .
Result	The dependence between PFS and OS was @ .
Result	These associations were confirmed in the testing data set .
Conclusion	In patients with mRCC who were treated with interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab , the PFS at @ months and @ months was found to be predictive of OS .
Conclusion	A high dependence between PFS and OS was observed , suggesting that PFS may be used as a surrogate endpoint for OS .
Conclusion	Although this is a novel observation for RCC , these findings require validation in patients with mRCC who are treated with other targeted agents .

Background	Blond and white hair removal by laser is a complicated task with weak satisfactory results due to the deficiency in laser-absorbing chromophore .
Problem	To investigate if repetitive sessions of photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) using external application of liposomal Rose bengal ( RB ) photosensitizer followed by intense pulsed light ( IPL ) exposure enables removal of gray and white hair .
Method	Rose bengal loaded in liposomes ( LRB ) was constructed , prepared in hydrogel , and was studied for some pharmaceutical properties .
Method	Penetration and selective hair follicle damage in mice skin were studied .
Method	Topical gel containing LRB was used for treating fifteen adult females who were complaining of facial white terminal hair .
Method	Unwanted facial hair was treated for three sessions at intervals of @-@ weeks using intense pulsed light ( IPL ) .
Method	At each session , the treatment area was pre-treated with topical LRB gel , while a control group of another @ patients applied placebo gel before IPL treatment .
Method	Evaluations included hair regrowth , which was measured @ weeks after each treatment session and at @ months follow-up by counting the number of terminal hair compared with baseline pretreatment values .
Method	Treatment outcomes and complications if any were also reported .
Result	Average hair regrowth in the LRB group was @ % after @ treatment cycles .
Result	After six-months follow up , average terminal hair count compared with baseline pretreatment showed @ % reduction and no recorded side effects .
Result	A significant difference ( P < @ ) was seen compared with the control group ; the clinical results were promising .
Conclusion	Photodynamic hair removal using rose bengal-encapsulated liposomal gel in combination with IPL treatment showed significant efficacy in the treatment of white hair compared with a control group .

Problem	We report the results of the investigation of safety and efficacy of venous angioplasty in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) with findings of extracranial venous anomalies , considered hallmarks of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ( CCSVI ) , in a @-phase study ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT@ ) .
Method	Phase @ was an open-label safety study ( @ patients ) ; phase @ was sham-controlled , randomized , and double-blind ( @ sham procedure , @ treated ) .
Method	All study patients fulfilled venous hemodynamic screening criteria indicative of CCSVI .
Method	Assessment was at @ , @ , and @ months postprocedure with MRI , clinical , and hemodynamic outcomes .
Method	Primary endpoints were safety at @ hours and @ month , venous outflow restoration > @ % at @ month , and effect of angioplasty on new lesion activity and relapse rate over @ months .
Method	Secondary endpoints included changes in disability , brain volume , cognitive tests , and quality of life .
Result	No perioperative complications were noted ; however , one patient with history of syncope was diagnosed with episodic bradycardia requiring placement of a pacemaker before discharge .
Result	Doppler evidence-based venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score ( VHISS ) was reduced > @ % compared to baseline in phase @ ( at @ month ) but not phase @ .
Result	In phase @ , higher MRI activity ( cumulative number of new contrast-enhancing lesions -LSB- @ vs @ , p = @ -RSB- and new T@ lesions -LSB- @ vs @ , p = @ -RSB- ) and relapse activity ( @ vs @ , p = @ ) were identified as nonsignificant trends in the treated vs sham arm over @ months .
Result	Using analysis of covariance , significant cumulative new T@ lesions were related to larger VHISS decrease ( p = @ ) and angioplasty ( p = @ ) over the follow-up .
Result	No differences in other endpoints were detected .
Conclusion	Venous angioplasty is not an effective treatment for MS over the short term and may exacerbate underlying disease activity .
Method	This is a Class I study demonstrating that clinical and imaging outcomes are no better or worse in patients with MS identified with venous outflow restriction who receive venous angioplasty compared to sham controls who do not receive angioplasty .
Method	This study also includes a Class IV phase @ study of safety in @ patients receiving the angioplasty procedure .

Background	Spinal anesthesia is widely used for caesarean section due to its rapid onset , low failure rate , complete analgesia .
Background	Addition of intrathecal ketamine and opioids to local anaesthetics seems to improve the quality of block and prolong the duration of analgesia .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of intrathecal ketamine mixed with hyperbaric bupivacaine to intrathecal fentanyl mixed with hyperbaric bupivacaine .
Method	One hundred parturients ASA Grade I scheduled for elective or semiurgent caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided into two groups .
Method	Group A received @ml ( @ mg ) hyperbaric bupivacaine @ % plus @ mg preservative free ketamine .
Method	Group B received @ml ( @mg ) hyperbaric bupivacaine @ % plus @g fentanyl .
Method	The patients were observed intraoperatively for the onset of sensory block , degree of motor block and total duration of analgesia .
Result	The time to achieve Bromage scale @ motor blockade was shorter in Group A than in Group B. ( p = @ ) whereas time to achieve highest dermatomal level of sensory block was shorter in Group A than in Group B ( p = @ ) .
Result	The duration of spinal analgesia was longer in Group B than in Group A ( p = @ ) .
Result	The frequency of side effect such as sedation score was higher in Group A compared to Group B ( p = @ ) .
Result	The incidence of pruritus was significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Addition of preservative free ketamine lead to faster onset of sensory and motor blockade , although it did not prolong the duration of spinal analgesia compared to addition of fentanyl in parturients undergoing caesarean section with spinal anaesthesia .

Problem	Longitudinal studies have begun to clarify the phenotypic characteristics of adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis .
Problem	This @-site randomized trial examined whether a @-month program of family psychoeducation was effective in reducing the severity of attenuated positive and negative psychotic symptoms and enhancing functioning among individuals at high risk .
Method	Adolescents and young adults ( mean age @ @ years ) with attenuated positive psychotic symptoms , brief and intermittent psychosis , or genetic risk with functional deterioration were randomly assigned to @ sessions of family-focused therapy for individuals at clinical high risk ( FFT-CHR ) in @ months or @ sessions of family psychoeducation ( enhanced care -LSB- EC -RSB- ) .
Method	FFT-CHR included psychoeducation about early signs of psychosis , stress management , communication training , and problem-solving skills training , whereas EC focused on symptom prevention .
Method	Independent evaluators assessed participants at baseline and @ months on positive and negative symptoms andsocial-role functioning .
Result	Of @ participants , @ ( @ % ) were followed up at @months .
Result	Participants in FFT-CHR showed greater improvements in attenuated positive symptoms over @ months than participants in EC ( F@ ,@ = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	Negative symptoms improved independently of psychosocial treatments .
Result	Changes in psychosocial functioning depended on age : participants more than @ years of age showed more role improvement inFFT-CHR , whereas participants between @ and @ years of age showed more role improvement in EC .
Result	The results were independent of concurrent pharmacotherapy .
Conclusion	Interventions that focus on improving family relationships may have prophylactic efficacy in individuals at high risk for psychosis .
Conclusion	Future studies should examine the specificity of effects of family intervention compared to individual therapy of the sameduration and frequency .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registration information-Prevention Trial of Family Focused Treatment in Youth at Risk for Psychosis ; http://clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT@ .

Problem	Direct evidence for the effects of vegetable intake on weight loss is qualified .
Problem	The study aimed to assess the effect of higher vegetable consumption on weight loss .
Method	A single blind parallel controlled trial was conducted with @ overweight adults ( mean body mass index = @ kg/m ( @ ) ) randomised to two energy deficit healthy diet advice groups differing only by doubling the serving ( portion ) sizes of vegetables in the comparator group .
Method	Data were analysed as intention-to-treat using a linear mixed model .
Method	Spearmans rho bivariate was used to explore relationships between percentage energy from vegetables and weight loss .
Result	After @ months , the study sample lost @ kg ( P < @ time ) with no difference between groups ( P > @ interaction ) .
Result	Both groups increased vegetable intake and lost weight in the first @ months , and the change in weight was significantly correlated with higher proportions of energy consumed as vegetables ( rho = -@ , P = @ ) .
Result	Fasting glucose , insulin and triglyceride levels decreased ( P < @ time ) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased ( P < @ time ) , with no difference between groups .
Result	Weight loss was sustained for @ months by both groups , but the comparator group reported greater hunger satisfaction ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Advice to consume a healthy low-energy diet leads to sustained weight loss , with reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors regardless of an emphasis on more vegetables .
Conclusion	In the short term , consuming a higher proportion of the dietary energy as vegetables may support a greater weight loss and the dietary pattern appears sustainable .

Background	Previous work has demonstrated paradoxical increases in cerebral oxygen saturation ( ScO@ ) as blood pressure decreases and paradoxical decreases in ScO@ as blood pressure increases .
Background	It has been suggested that these paradoxical responses indicate a functional cerebral autoregulation mechanism .
Background	Accordingly , the authors hypothesized that if this suggestion is correct , paradoxical responses will occur exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation .
Method	Thirty-four patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included .
Method	Cerebral autoregulation was assessed with the near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oximetry index ( COx ) , computed by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between mean arterial pressure and ScO@ .
Method	COx less than @ was previously defined as functional autoregulation .
Method	During cardiopulmonary bypass , @ % change in blood pressure was accomplished with the use of nitroprusside for decreasing pressure and phenylephrine for increasing pressure .
Method	Effects on COx were assessed .
Method	Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA , Kruskal-Wallis test , and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test .
Result	Sixty-five percent of patients had a baseline COx less than @ , indicating functional baseline autoregulation .
Result	In @ % of these patients ( n = @ ) , COx became highly negative after vasoactive drug administration ( from -@ -LSB- -@ to @ -RSB- to -@ -LSB- -@ to -@ -RSB- after administration of phenylephrine , and from -@ -LSB- -@ to @ -RSB- to -@ -LSB- -@ to -@ -RSB- after administration of nitroprusside ) .
Result	A negative COx implies a decrease in ScO@ with increase in pressure and , conversely , an increase in ScO@ with decrease in pressure .
Conclusion	In this study , paradoxical changes in ScO@ after pharmacological-induced pressure changes occurred exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation , corroborating the hypothesis that these paradoxical responses might be attributable to a functional cerebral autoregulation .

Background	Penetrating keratoplasty can commonly restore vision in corneal blindness .
Background	However , immunological graft reactions may induce irreversible graft failure in a substantial percentage .
Background	Repeat keratoplasties in turn are associated with increased risk of graft failure and possibly irreversible blindness .
Background	Topical as well as systemic immunosuppressants are administered for prophylaxis .
Background	However , severe adverse effects limit long-term usage .
Background	By contrast , matching for transplantation antigens might be effective for a long time .
Method	FANCY is a prospective , controlled , randomised , double-blind , multi-centre clinical trial with two parallel arms .
Method	The primary objective is to evaluate superiority of the proposed HLA matching strategy in comparison to random graft assignment with respect to the primary endpoint ` time to first endothelial graft rejection ' .
Method	Relevant inclusion criteria are age over @years and waiting for penetrating or endothelial lamellar keratoplasty .
Method	The most important exclusion criteria are abuse of medication and/or drugs and an anticipated waiting time for an HLA match longer than @months .
Method	After randomisation , patients either receive a HLA-matched graft ( experimental intervention ) or a random graft ( control intervention ) .
Method	The calculated sample size is @ patients .
Method	The trial started in @ with a recruitment period of @months .
Method	A total of @ patients were included during this time .
Conclusion	The primary goal of FANCY is to assess whether histocompatibility matching is feasible and effective in the broad clinical routine .
Conclusion	However , during the course of the trial , the landscape of keratoplasty changed due to the rise of Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty ( DMEK ) .
Conclusion	Nowadays , immune reactions are confined mostly to the ` high-risk ' subgroups .
Conclusion	If we would design FANCY in @ , we would narrow down the inclusion criteria to include only the high risk patients and accept longer waiting times for a matching donor here .

Background	Cigarette demand , or the change in cigarette consumption as a function of price , is a measure of reinforcement that is associated with level of tobacco dependence and other clinically relevant measures , but the effects of experimentally controlled income on real-world cigarette consumption have not been examined .
Method	In this study , income available for cigarette purchases was manipulated to assess the effect on cigarette demand .
Method	Tobacco-dependent cigarette smokers ( n = @ ) who smoked @-@ cigarettes per day completed a series of cigarette purchasing tasks under a variety of income conditions meant to mimic different weekly cigarette budgets : $ @ , approximately $ @ , $ @ , or approximately $ @ per week .
Method	Prices of $ @ , $ @ , $ @ , and $ @ per cigarette were assessed in each income condition .
Method	Participants were instructed to purchase as many cigarettes as they would like for the next week and to only consume cigarettes purchased in the context of the study .
Method	One price in @ income condition was randomly chosen to be `` real , '' and the cigarettes and the excess money in the budget for that condition were given to the participant .
Result	Results indicate that demand elasticity was negatively correlated with income .
Result	Demand intensity ( consumption at low prices ) was unrelated to income condition and remained high across incomes .
Conclusion	These results indicate that the amount of income that is available for cigarette purchases has a large effect on cigarette consumption , but only at high prices .

Background	Acute cellular rejection ( AR ) after lung transplantation may result in significant morbidity and mortality both on the short and long term .
Background	Transbronchial biopsy through flexible bronchoscopy is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of AR , but reproducibility of histopathologic interpretation is less convincing .
Background	Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) , a novel imaging tool in the field of respiratory medicine , enables real-time imaging of the pulmonary acini .
Method	We performed @ bronchoscopies in lung transplant recipients , combining both transbronchial biopsies and pCLE .
Method	We conducted an observational survey for pCLE findings in AR .
Result	Calculations for cellularity showed a median cell count ( ACA ) of @ ( IQR @ to @ ) cells per microscopic field for AR and @ ( IQR @ to @ ) cells per microscopic field for matched controls ( p = @ ) .
Result	Cellular autofluorescence in the AR group was @,@ ( @ ) units and @ ( @ ) units for the matched controls ( p = @ ) .
Result	Autofluorescent cells were present in @ % ( @ ) of the recorded frames in the AR group and in only @ % ( @ ) of the recorded frames in the control group ( p = @ ) .
Result	Contingency analysis for the presence/absence of ACA in the AR group versus the control group showed a sensitivity of @ and a specificity of @ ( relative risk = @ -LSB- @ % CI @ to @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	The consecutive application of @ pCLE criteria resulted in a sensitivity of @ and a specificity of @ for detection of AR .
Conclusion	Our observational survey suggests the existence of specific pCLE characteristics in patients with AR .
Conclusion	Further efforts are necessary to validate these findings prospectively .

Problem	This study aims to compare the effects of a lifestyle intervention using a behavioral therapy ( BT ) approach with the effects of a cardioprotective structured hypocaloric diet on metabolic syndrome in Mexican postmenopausal women .
Method	This study is a randomized clinical trial ( @-@ ) of Mexican postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome ( Adult Treatment Panel III criteria ) who were recruited from the Postmenopause Clinic of the National Institute of Perinatology in Mexico City .
Method	Women were assigned to one of two groups -- group @ ( structured hypocaloric diet ; n = @ ) : energy restriction ( -@ to -@ kcal/d ) emphasizing cardioprotective dietary changes ; and group @ ( BT ; n = @ ) : goal setting , problem-solving , and stimulus control to achieve cardioprotective dietary and lifestyle recommendations .
Method	Metabolic syndrome prevalence , as well as weight , waist circumference , fat mass , and fasting biochemical markers ( glucose and lipid profile ) , were measured at baseline and at @ , @ , and @ months after the intervention .
Method	Metabolic syndrome risk ( relative risk and absolute risk reduction ) , mean differences between groups , and logistic regression were evaluated using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software , version @ .
Result	A total of @ women were studied ( mean -LSB- SD -RSB- age , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- y ) .
Result	No baseline differences were observed between groups .
Result	At the end of the study , a higher reduction in metabolic syndrome prevalence was observed in group @ ( -@ % ) compared with group @ ( -@ % ; relative risk , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	The effect was maintained even when adjusted by age , hormone therapy and antihypertensive drug use .
Conclusion	A cardioprotective structured hypocaloric diet is more effective than the BT approach in reducing metabolic syndrome after @ months of intervention .
Conclusion	Both strategies have positive effects on different individual cardiovascular risk factors .

Background	Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are widely accepted as being the most efficient way of investigating the efficacy of psychological therapies .
Background	However , researchers conducting RCTs commonly report difficulties in recruiting an adequate sample within planned timescales .
Background	In an effort to overcome recruitment difficulties , researchers often are forced to expand their recruitment criteria or extend the recruitment phase , thus increasing costs and delaying publication of results .
Background	Research investigating the effectiveness of recruitment strategies is limited , and trials often fail to report sufficient details about the recruitment sources and resources utilized .
Problem	We examined the efficacy of strategies implemented during the Staying Well after Depression RCT in Oxford to recruit participants with a history of recurrent depression .
Method	We describe eight recruitment methods utilized and two further sources not initiated by the research team and examine their efficacy in terms of ( @ ) the return , including the number of potential participants who contacted the trial and the number who were randomized into the trial ; ( @ ) cost-effectiveness , comprising direct financial cost and manpower for initial contacts and randomized participants ; and ( @ ) comparison of sociodemographic characteristics of individuals recruited from different sources .
Result	Poster advertising , web-based advertising , and mental health worker referrals were the cheapest methods per randomized participant ; however , the ratio of randomized participants to initial contacts differed markedly per source .
Result	Advertising online , via posters , and on a local radio station were the most cost-effective recruitment methods for soliciting participants who subsequently were randomized into the trial .
Result	Advertising across many sources ( saturation ) was found to be important .
Conclusion	It may not be feasible to employ all the recruitment methods used in this trial to obtain participation from other populations , such as those currently unwell , or in other geographical locations .
Conclusion	Recruitment source was unavailable for participants who could not be reached after the initial contact .
Conclusion	Thus , it is possible that the efficiency of certain methods of recruitment was poorer than estimated .
Conclusion	Efficacy and costs of other recruitment initiatives , such as providing travel expenses to the in-person eligibility assessment and making follow-up telephone calls to candidates who contacted the recruitment team but could not be screened promptly , were not analysed .
Conclusion	Website advertising resulted in the highest number of randomized participants and was the second cheapest method of recruiting .
Conclusion	Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment strategies for other samples to contribute to a comprehensive base of knowledge for future RCTs .

Background	Disturbances of the circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion are associated with depression , coronary calcification , and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.The primary aim of this study was to test the associations between midnight salivary cortisol ( MSC ) , depression and HbA@c , and control for behavioural , environmental and intra individual factors with possible impact on cortisol secretion , like smoking , physical inactivity , season , medication , diabetes duration , severe hypoglycemia episodes , age and gender in patients with type @ diabetes .
Background	Secondary aims were to present MSC levels for a reference group of non-depressed type @ diabetes patients with a healthy life style ( physically active and non-smoking ) , and to explore seasonal variations .
Method	A cross-sectional population based study of @ patients ( @ % men and @ % women ) aged @-@ years that participated in a randomized controlled trial targeting depression in type @ diabetes .
Method	Depression was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale .
Method	MSC , HbA@c , serum-lipids , blood pressure , waist circumference and data from medical records and the Swedish National Diabetes Registry were collected .
Result	Thirty four patients ( @ % ) had MSC @ nmol/L , which was associated with smoking ( AOR @ ) , spring season ( AOR @ ) , physical inactivity ( AOR @ ) , self-reported depression ( AOR @ ) , and older age ( per year ) ( AOR @ ) .
Result	HbA@c > @ mmol/mol ( > @ % ) ( AOR @ ) and MSC @ nmol/L ( AOR @ ) were independently linked to self-reported depression .
Result	Season was strongly associated with MSC levels and no other variables studied showed seasonal variations .
Result	In a reference group of @ non-depressed patients with a healthy life style ( physically active , non-smoking ) the median MSC level was @ nmol/L ( range @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	In this study of patients with type @ diabetes high MSC was linked to smoking , physical inactivity , depression , season and older age .
Conclusion	Thus a high cortisol value identified three major targets for treatment in type @ diabetes .

Problem	To evaluate the effectiveness of two subsequent intervention components ( motivational and self-regulatory components ) , placed in different order , to promote fruit and vegetable ( FV ) intake .
Method	After baseline assessment , university students ( N = @ , aged @-@ years ) were allocated to two groups .
Method	One group received a motivational intervention ( outcome expectancies , risk perception , and task self-efficacy ) followed by a self-regulatory intervention ( planning and dietary self-efficacy ) after @ days .
Method	The second group received the same intervention conditions in the opposite order .
Method	Follow-up assessments were done after another @ days .
Result	Both intervention sequences yielded gains in terms of FV intake and self-efficacy .
Result	However , this gain was only due to the self-regulatory component whereas the motivational component did not contribute to the changes .
Result	Moreover , changes in intention and self-efficacy mediated between intervention sequence and follow-up behavior , suggesting that improving these proximal predictors of FV intake was responsible for the behavioral gains .
Conclusion	Findings highlight the superiority of a self-regulatory intervention over a motivational intervention when it comes to dietary changes in this sample of young adults .
Conclusion	Moreover , changes in dietary self-efficacy may drive nutritional changes .

Problem	The aim of this study was assessment of subendometrial blood flow with Doppler ultrasonography as an indicator of endometrial receptivity in stimulated cycles for intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) .
Method	This prospective study enrolled @ women scheduled for IUI after ovarian stimulation randomly assigned to one of the three equal groups ; group ( C ) received Clomiphene citrate , group ( H ) received HMG and group ( CH ) received Clomiphene citrate in addition to HMG .
Method	All participants had ultrasound folliculometry starting on day @ , followed by transvaginal Doppler study of the subendometrial blood flow and perifollicular blood flow on the day of detecting at least one follicle > @mm .
Method	Resistivity index ( RI ) and pulsatility index ( PI ) of subendometrial and perifollicular flow were measured .
Method	Endometrial thickness was measured on day of hCG injection .
Result	Group ( H ) showed significantly higher frequency of subendometrial flow ( @ % ) compared to the other two groups ( p = @ ) .
Result	In cases of positive subendometrial flow , the RI and PI were significantly lower in group ( H ) compared to the other two groups ( p = @ and @ , respectively ) .
Result	Endometrial thickness was significantly lower in group ( C ) compared to group ( H ) ( p < @ ) and group ( CH ) ( p < @ ) .
Result	Successful intrauterine implantation was documented in a total of @ women ( @ % ) ; the highest frequency was in group ( H ) ( @ % ) and the lowest in group ( C ) , however , the difference between the three groups was not significant ( p = @ ) .
Result	Subendometrial indices and perifollicular RI were significantly lower in cases of successful implantation , while endometrium was significantly thicker in these cases ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	The presence of subendometrial flow is associated with successful IUI in women under stimulated cycles undergoing IUI .
Conclusion	HMG seems a superior option for induction of ovulation regarding success of implantation .

Background	Excessive intravenous fluid prescription may play a causal role in postoperative complications following major gastrointestinal resectional surgery .
Background	The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluid and salt restriction would decrease postoperative complications compared with a more modern controlled liberal regimen .
Method	In this observer-blinded single-site randomized clinical trial consecutive patients undergoing major gastrointestinal resectional surgery were randomized to receive either a liberal control fluid regimen or a restricted fluid and salt regimen .
Method	The primary outcome was postoperative complications of grade II and above ( moderate to severe ) .
Result	Some @ patients ( @ colorectal resections and @ oesophagogastric resections ) were enrolled in the study ; @ patients were randomized to the restricted regimen and @ to the control ( liberal ) regimen .
Result	During surgery the control group received a median ( interquartile range ) fluid volume of @ ( @-@ ) ml and sodium input of @ ( @-@ ) mmol , compared with @ ( @-@ ) ml and @ ( @-@ ) mmol respectively in the restricted group .
Result	There was no significant difference in major complication rate between groups ( @ and @ per cent respectively ) .
Result	Median ( range ) hospital stay was @ ( @-@ ) days in the controls and @ ( range @-@ ) days among those who received restricted fluids .
Result	There were four in-hospital deaths in the control group and two in the restricted group .
Result	Substantial differences in weight change , serum sodium , osmolality and urine : serum osmolality ratio were observed between the groups .
Conclusion	There were no significant differences in major complication rates , length of stay and in-hospital deaths when fluid restriction was used compared with a more liberal regimen .

Background	Org @ is a glycine transporter inhibitor that increases extracellular glycine levels and attenuates alcohol-induced dopaminergic activity in the nucleus accumbens .
Background	In animal models , Org @ has dose-dependent effects on ethanol intake , preference , and relapse-like behavior without tolerance .
Background	The current study aimed to translate these animal findings to humans by examining whether Org @ prevents relapse in detoxified alcohol-dependent patients .
Method	This was a multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial .
Method	Adult patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive Org @ @ mg twice a day or placebo for @ days .
Method	The primary end point was percentage heavy drinking days ( defined as @ standard drinks per day for men and @ for women ) .
Method	Secondary end points included other measures of relapse-related drinking behavior ( e.g. , drinks per day , time to relapse ) , as well as measures of global functioning , alcohol-related thoughts and cravings , and motivation .
Result	A total of @ subjects were included in the intent-to-treat analysis .
Result	The trial was stopped approximately midway after a futility analysis showing that the likelihood of detecting a signal at study term was < @ % .
Result	There was no significant difference between Org @ and placebo on percentage heavy drinking days or any other measure of relapse-related drinking behavior .
Result	Org @ showed no safety issues and was fairly well tolerated , with fatigue , dizziness , and transient visual events as the most commonly occurring side effects .
Conclusion	Org @ demonstrated no benefit over placebo in preventing alcohol relapse .
Conclusion	Study limitations and implications are discussed .

Background	The consumption of citrus fruits is associated with health benefits .
Background	However , clinical data regarding the effects of grapefruit flavanone consumption on vascular function are lacking .
Problem	The objective of the present study was to address the role of flavanones in the long-term effects induced by grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) consumption on vascular function in healthy postmenopausal women .
Method	Forty-eight healthy postmenopausal women aged @-@ y within @-@ y since menopause , a body mass index ( in kg/m ( @ ) ) of @-@ , and a waist size > @ cm completed this double-blind , randomized , controlled , crossover trial .
Method	These volunteers were randomly assigned to consume @ mL GFJ/d , providing @ mg naringenin glycosides , or a matched control drink without flavanones for @ mo each , with a @-mo washout between beverages .
Method	The primary endpoint was the assessment of endothelial function in the brachial artery by using flow-mediated dilation .
Method	Blood pressure , arterial stiffness , and endothelial function in the peripheral arterial bed were also evaluated as indicators of vascular function .
Method	These measurements and blood collection for clinical biochemical markers were performed in overnight-fasted subjects before and after the @-mo treatment periods .
Result	The mean SD carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity , which reflects central aortic stiffness , was statistically significantly lower after consumption of GFJ ( @ @ m/s ) than after consumption of the matched control drink without flavanones ( @ @ m/s ) , with a P value of @ for the treatment effect .
Result	Endothelial function in macro - and microcirculation , blood pressure , anthropometric measures , glucose metabolism , and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were not affected by the intervention .
Conclusion	Regular GFJ consumption by middle-aged , healthy postmenopausal women is beneficial for arterial stiffness .
Conclusion	This effect may be related to flavanones present in grapefruit .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Background	Children in Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) are burdened by significant unmet mental health needs , but this region has limited access to mental health workers and resources to address these needs .
Background	Despite the successes of numerous school-based interventions for promoting child mental health , most evidence-based interventions are not available in SSA .
Background	This study will investigate the transportability of an evidence-based program from a developed country ( United States ) to a SSA country ( Uganda ) .
Background	The approach includes task-shifting to early childhood teachers and consists of professional development ( five days ) to introduce strategies for effective behavior management and positive teacher-student interactions , and group-based consultation ( @ sessions ) to support adoption of effective practices and tailoring to meet the needs of individual students .
Method	The design of this study is guided by two implementation frameworks , the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Teacher Training Implementation Model , that consider multidimensional aspects of intervention fidelity and contextual predictors that may influence implementation and teacher outcomes .
Method	Using a cluster randomized design , @ schools in Uganda will be randomized to either the intervention group ( five schools ) or the waitlist control group ( five schools ) .
Method	A total of @ to @ early childhood teachers will be enrolled in the study .
Method	Teacher utilization of evidence-based strategies and practices will be assessed at baseline , immediate post-intervention ( six months after baseline ) , and at seven months post-intervention ( during a new academic year ) .
Method	Fidelity measures will be assessed throughout the program implementation period ( during professional development and consultation sessions ) .
Method	Individual teacher and contextual factors will be assessed at baseline .
Method	Data will be collected from multiple sources .
Method	Linear mixed-effect modeling , adjusting for school nesting , will be applied to address study questions .
Conclusion	The study will produce important information regarding the value of an evidence-based early intervention , and a theory-guided implementation process and tools designed for use in implementing early childhood evidence-based programs in SSA countries or resource-constrained community settings .

Problem	To evaluate the clinical effects of Yuleshu oral mixture combined with conventional therapy on chronic prostatitis .
Method	Eighty-eight patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) were equally randomized to a control and an experimental group to receive conventional therapy ( oral antibiotics , alpha blockers , proprietary Chinese medicine for activating blood circulation and massage of the prostate ) and conventional therapy combined with Yuleshu oral mixture respectively .
Method	Before and after treatment , the severity of symptoms and sexual function of the patients were evaluated using NIH-CPSI and IIEF-@ , their anxiety , depression and other emotional problems assessed with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD ) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAMA ) , and the results subjected to statistical analysis .
Result	Both the experimental and control groups showed significant improvement in prostatitis symptoms and sexual function after treatment as compared with the baseline ( P < @ ) , even more significant in the former than in the latter group , especially in pain symptoms ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ , P < @ ) .
Result	Before and after treatment , the HAMA and HAMD score had no significant difference in the control , but there was significant difference in the experimental group .
Result	The experimental group exhibited remarkably higher scores after than before treatment on HAMA ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ , P < @ ) and HAMD ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ , P < @ ) , but not the control group ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	Yuleshu oral mixture can effectively relieve anxiety , depression and other psychological problems in CP/CPPS patients , and improve their clinical symptoms as well .
Conclusion	Therefore , it is an effective drug for chronic prostatitis .

Problem	The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the order of complementary feeding in relation to breast-feeding affects breast milk , semisolid , or total energy intake in infants .
Method	The present study was designed as a randomized crossover trial .
Method	The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital .
Method	The study participants were @ healthy infants between the ages of @ and @ months who were exclusively breast-fed for at least @ months and were now receiving complementary foods for at least @ month in addition to breast-feeding .
Method	Infants were randomized to follow a sequence of either complementary feeding before breast-feeding ( sequence A ) or complementary feeding after breast-feeding ( sequence B ) for the first day ( @ hours ) of the study period using simple randomization .
Method	For the next day , the sequence was reversed for each child .
Method	All babies received @ actively fed complementary food meals per day ( morning , afternoon , and evening ) .
Method	A semisolid study diet was prepared in the hospital by cooking rice and pulse with oil using a standard method , ensuring the energy density of at least @ kcal/g .
Method	The infants were allowed ad libitum breast-feeding during the observation period .
Method	Semisolid intake was directly measured and breast milk intake was quantified by test weighing method .
Method	Energy intake from complementary foods was calculated from the product of energy density of the diet served on that day and the total amount consumed .
Method	The total energy intake and energy intake from breast milk and complementary foods between the @ sequences were compared .
Result	The mean ( standard deviation ) energy intake from breast milk during @ hours of daytime by following sequence A ( complementary feeding before breast-feeding ) was @ ( @ ) kcal in comparison with @ ( @ ) kcal in sequence B , which was not statistically different ( P = @ ) .
Result	The mean ( standard deviation ) energy consumed from semisolids in sequences A and B was also comparable ( @ -LSB- @ -RSB- kcal vs. @ -LSB- @ -RSB- kcal ; P = @ ) .
Result	The total energy intake during daytime in sequence A was @ ( @ ) kcal in comparison with @ ( @ ) kcal in sequence B , which was also comparable ( P = @ ) .
Result	The results related to energy intake through breast milk and total energy intake were not different when insensible losses during feeding were adjusted in both groups .
Conclusion	Altering the sequence of complementary feeding in relation to breast-feeding does not affect total energy intake .

Problem	To investigate the efficacy of various formulations of chlorhexidine @ % ( CHX ) in terms of plaque and gingival bleeding control compared to each other and to saline rinse ( CTRL ) over a @-day rinsing period .
Method	Seventy subjects were randomly allocated to one of @ groups rinsing twice daily for @ days .
Method	The different groups used CHX @ % rinse with alcohol ( CHX@ ) and without alcohol ( CHX@ ) , with an antidiscolouration system ( CHX@ ) or saline rinse ( CTRL ) .
Method	Clinical examinations to evaluate full-mouth plaque scores ( FMPS ) and periodontal parameters were performed at baseline , @ , @ and @ days .
Method	Tooth discolouration ( TD ) was measured at each time point using digital photographs and spectrophotometric analysis .
Result	At @ days , CTRL showed the highest levels of plaque .
Result	The mean changes in FMPS from baseline were @ % @ for CHX@ , @ % @ for CHX@ , @ % @ for CHX@ and @ % @ for CTRL .
Result	Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between CHX@ and CHX@ ( p = @ ) , CHX@ vs CHX@ ( p @ ) and CHX@/CHX@ vs CHX@ ( p < @ ) .
Result	In contrast , CHX@ appeared more effective in reducing inflammatory indexes .
Result	TD increased over time in @ % to @ % of participants , although lighter staining was found in the CHX@ group .
Result	Greater FMPS reduction was observed in participants with staining vs without staining ( @ % @ , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Conventional CHX appeared more effective in terms of plaque reduction .
Conclusion	Interestingly , the newest formulation showed a higher control of gingival inflammation .
Conclusion	Staining was associated with lower plaque levels .

Background	The debate about whether energy consumed in liquid form is more obesogenic than energy consumed in solid form remains equivocal .
Background	We aimed to evaluate the effects of liquid versus solid energy intake and different beverage types on changes in childhood adiposity .
Method	Our analyses included @-year-old Australian children ( n = @ ) participating in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study .
Method	Dietary information was collected using three @-h recalls at age @ years .
Method	Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of liquid versus solid energy intake and different beverage types on changes in body mass index ( BMI ) Z-score from ages @ to @ years ( BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) ) and percentage body fat ( % BF ) at age @ years ( % BF ( @ y ) ) .
Method	Substitution models were used to evaluate the effects of substituting other beverage types for sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSB ) .
Result	Liquid energy intake ( @ MJ day ( -@ ) ) was more closely associated with both BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) ( = @ , P = @ ) and % BF ( @ y ) ( = @ % , P = @ ) than solid energy intake ( BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) : = @ , P = @ and % BF ( @ y ) : = @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	SSB consumption ( @ g day ( -@ ) ) was directly associated with BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) ( = @ , P = @ ) and % BF ( @ y ) ( = @ % , P = @ ) , whereas diet drinks ( @ g day ( -@ ) ) were inversely associated with BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) ( = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Substitution of @ g of SSB by @ g of water or diet drink , but not other beverages , was inversely associated with both BMIz ( @-@ @ y ) and % BF ( @ y ) ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our findings indicate that liquid energy is more obesogenic than solid energy .
Conclusion	In particular , SSB , but not other beverage types , are a significant predictor of childhood adiposity and replacing SSB with water can have long-term beneficial effects on childhood adiposity .

Problem	We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of thrombospondin-@ ( TSP-@ ) on the risk of corneal allograft rejection .
Problem	The TSP-@ is known to be involved in the immune response of the anterior chamber of the eye , activating TGF-@ , promoting peripheral and systemic tolerance , and counteracting the proangiogenic activity of VEGF .
Method	Three tagging SNPs spanning the TSP-@ region ( rs@ , A > G ; rs@ , C > T ; and rs@ , A > G ) were genotyped .
Method	Association with risk of rejection was investigated in a group of @ corneal transplant recipients with risk factors for allograft rejection .
Method	Transplant recipients had completed @-year follow-up .
Result	The TSP-@ rs@ A SNP was associated significantly with an increased risk of corneal allograft rejection ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and there was a trend toward the rs@ , rs@ , rs@ ACA haplotype increasing risk of rejection .
Conclusion	The results suggest that TSP-@ rs@ AA homozygotes may be at increased risk of corneal transplant rejection , especially if they carry the ACA haplotype .

Background	Lipid-based nutrient supplements ( LNSs ) offer a vehicle to improve children 's diets in low-income countries where complementary foods are typically deficient in essential nutrients .
Background	Sustained acceptability by the intended users is essential for achieving growth-promoting effects .
Problem	We aimed to determine the sustained acceptability of LNSs among @ - to @-mo-old children in Malawi .
Method	In the context of a trial testing the growth-promoting effect of different formulations and doses of LNSs , we delivered LNSs to the homes of the children biweekly according to the randomization protocol .
Method	We defined acceptability to include adherence to feeding recommendations and mothers ' experiences of feeding LNSs to their child .
Method	We conducted brief interviews each week with the mothers .
Method	At @ time points we conducted knowledge , attitudes , and practices ( KAP ) interviews .
Method	In addition , we conducted repeated in-depth interviews with a subset of mothers .
Result	Of the @ children who received the LNS intervention , we analyzed adherence data from @ ( @ % ) children and KAP data at @ time points ( child 's age of @ and @ mo ) from @ ( @ % ) of the children .
Result	The mean SD overall adherence ( proportion of days when the study child reportedly consumed LNSs considering only those weeks when the supplement had been successfully delivered to the home ) was @ @ % , and there was no difference between children receiving milk-containing or milk-free LNSs .
Result	There was also no increasing or decreasing trend over time in any of the groups .
Result	Sharing and deviation from other feeding recommendations were common .
Result	Maternal experiences were mostly very positive .
Conclusion	The acceptability of LNS products was good and was sustained for @ mo in this rural Malawian population .
Conclusion	However , sharing of the products with family members and deviation from other feeding recommendations were frequent , which means that individually targeted children were likely to receive less than the intended dose of the LNS .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Background	A lack of physical activity and overconsumption of energy dense food is associated with overweight and obesity .
Background	The neighbourhood environment may stimulate or hinder the development and/or maintenance of a healthy lifestyle .
Background	To improve research on the obesogenicity of neighbourhood environments , reliable , valid and convenient assessment methods of potential obesogenic characteristics of neighbourhood environments are needed .
Background	This study examines the reliability and validity of the SPOTLIGHT-Virtual Audit Tool ( S-VAT ) , which uses remote sensing techniques ( Street View feature in Google Earth ) for desk-based assessment of environmental obesogenicity .
Method	A total of @ street segments in four Dutch urban neighbourhoods - heterogeneous in socio-economic status and residential density - were assessed using the S-VAT .
Method	Environmental characteristics were categorised as walking related items , cycling related items , public transport , aesthetics , land use-mix , grocery stores , food outlets and physical activity facilities .
Method	To assess concordance of inter - and intra-observer reliability of the Street View feature in Google Earth , and validity scores with real life audits , percentage agreement and Cohen 's Kappa ( k ) were calculated .
Result	Intra-observer reliability was high and ranged from @ % agreement ( k = @ ) to @ % agreement ( k = @ ) with an overall agreement of @ % ( k = @ ) .
Result	Inter-observer reliability results ranged from substantial agreement @ % ( k = @ ) to high agreement , @ % ( k = @ ) , with an overall agreement of @ % ( k = @ ) .
Result	Criterion validity was substantial to high for most of the categories ranging from @ % agreement ( k = @ ) to @ % agreement ( k = @ ) with an overall score of @ % agreement ( k = @ ) .
Conclusion	These study results suggest that the S-VAT is a highly reliable and valid remote sensing tool to assess potential obesogenic environmental characteristics .

Background	Intracerebral hemorrhage causes @ % of strokes annually in the United States , and there is currently no effective therapy .
Problem	This is a clinical trial designed to study the safety , feasibility , and efficacy of a protocol of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia in intracerebral hemorrhage patients .
Method	The targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage trial is a prospective , single-center , interventional , randomized , parallel , two-arm ( @:@ ) phase-II clinical trial with blinded end-point ascertainment .
Method	Intracerebral hemorrhage patients will be randomized within @h of symptom onset to either @h of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia ( @-@C ) followed by a controlled rewarming at of @-@C per hour or @h of targeted temperature management to normothermia ( @-@C ) using endovascular or surface cooling .
Result	The primary outcome is the development of serious adverse events possibly and probably related to treatment .
Result	Secondary outcomes include in-hospital neurological deterioration between day @-@ , in-hospital mortality , functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin scale at discharge and @ days , and effect of treatment allocation on cerebral edema and hematoma volume .
Conclusion	Intracerebral hemorrhage remains the most severe form of stroke with limited options to improve survival .
Conclusion	As the early resuscitation phase in the intensive care unit represents the greatest opportunity for impact on clinical outcome , it also appears to be the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating aggressive treatments .
Conclusion	More research of novel therapies to improve outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage is desperately needed .
Conclusion	The results of the targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage clinical trial may provide additional information on the applicability of targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage .

Background	In most cases the only knowledge an individual will receive with regards to their own body and its proper functioning is during their high school education .
Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate high school students ' knowledge about basic physiology .
Method	The research was carried out in five , randomly chosen high schools in Krakow , Poland .
Method	Young people in the age of @-@ years were asked to fill in the questionnaire designed by the authors .
Method	The first part of the survey included personal data .
Method	The second part contained @ close-ended questions assessing students ' knowledge about the basics of human physiology .
Method	Question difficulty varied from easy through average , and up to difficult .
Method	The maximum number of points to achieve was @ .
Result	One-thousand-and eighty-three ( out of @ invited -- @ % ) Polish high school students ( @ % female ) filled in a @-item questionnaire constructed by the authors regarding basic human physiology .
Result	The mean age of the group was @ @ years .
Result	The mean score among the surveyed was @ @ ( range @-@ ) .
Result	Only @ % of students achieved a grade of @ % or more , and only one person obtained the highest possible score .
Result	Females achieved significantly better scores than males ( @ @ vs. @ @ ; p < @ ) .
Result	Pupils in their second year who were in the process of studying physiology , obtained better results than those in their third year who had already finished the biology course ( @ @ vs. @ @ respectively ; p < @ ) and those in their first year who did not yet study human physiology ( @ @ vs. @ @ respectively ; p = @ ) .
Result	Over @ % of students did not know that mature red blood cells do not have cell nuclei and a similar number of them answered that humans have @,@ erythrocytes in @ mm@ of blood .
Result	Over @ % believed that plasma does not participate in the transport of respiratory gases , and @ % believed that endocrine glands secrete hormones within their immediate vicinity and into the blood .
Conclusion	Our research has shown that young people , especially men , often lack basic physiological knowledge needed to make conscious and responsible decisions regarding their health .
Conclusion	Our results suggest that more emphasis should be put on properly teaching human physiology in high school , especially to those students who do not plan a career in medicine-related fields .
Conclusion	This study brings to light the disturbing fact that about a year after a student finishes his basic physiology course his knowledge of the subject returns to a pre high school level .

Problem	To compare the interstage cardiac catheterization hemodynamic and angiographic findings between shunt types for the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial .
Problem	The trial , which randomized subjects to a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt ( MBTS ) or right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt ( RVPAS ) for the Norwood procedure , demonstrated the RVPAS was associated with a smaller pulmonary artery diameter but superior @-month transplant-free survival .
Method	We analyzed the pre-stage II catheterization data for the trial subjects .
Method	The hemodynamic variables and shunt and pulmonary angiographic data were compared between shunt types ; their association with @-month transplant-free survival was also evaluated .
Result	Of @ randomized subjects , @ underwent pre-stage II catheterization .
Result	A smaller size , lower aortic and superior vena cava saturation , and higher ventricular end-diastolic pressure were associated with worse @-month transplant-free survival .
Result	The MBTS group had a lower coronary perfusion pressure ( @ vs @ mm Hg ; P < @ ) and greater pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio ( @ vs @ , P = @ ) .
Result	A greater pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio increased the risk of death or transplantation only in the RVPAS group ( P = @ ) .
Result	The MBTS group had fewer shunt ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and severe left pulmonary artery ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) stenoses , larger mid-main branch pulmonary artery diameters , and greater Nakata indexes ( @ vs @ , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Compared with the RVPAS subjects , the MBTS subjects had more hemodynamic abnormalities related to shunt physiology , and the RVPAS subjects had more shunt or pulmonary obstruction of a severe degree and inferior pulmonary artery growth at pre-stage II catheterization .
Conclusion	A lower body surface area , greater ventricular end-diastolic pressure , and lower superior vena cava saturation were associated with worse @-month transplant-free survival .

Background	The administration of intravenous fluid remains the cornerstone treatment for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury .
Background	However , no well-defined protocols exist to guide fluid administration in this treatment .
Background	We aimed to establish the efficacy of a new fluid protocol to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury .
Method	In this randomised , parallel-group , comparator-controlled , single-blind phase @ trial , we assessed the efficacy of a new fluid protocol based on the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation .
Method	The primary outcome was the occurrence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury , which was defined as a greater than @ % or greater than @ mg/dL increase in serum creatinine concentration .
Method	Between Oct @ , @ , and July @ , @ , @ patients aged @ years or older undergoing cardiac catheterisation with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of @ mL/min per @ m ( @ ) or less and one or more of several risk factors ( diabetes mellitus , history of congestive heart failure , hypertension , or age older than @ years ) were randomly allocated in a @:@ ratio to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided volume expansion ( n = @ ) or the control group ( n = @ ) who received a standard fluid administration protocol .
Method	Four computer-generated concealed randomisation schedules , each with permuted block sizes of @ , were used for randomisation , and participants were allocated to the next sequential randomisation number by sealed opaque envelopes .
Method	Patients and laboratory personnel were masked to treatment assignment , but the physicians who did the procedures were not masked .
Method	Both groups received intravenous @ % sodium chloride at @ mL/kg for @ h before cardiac catheterisation .
Method	Analyses were by intention to treat .
Method	Adverse events were assessed at @ days and @ months and all such events were classified by staff who were masked to treatment assignment .
Method	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	Contrast-induced acute kidney injury occurred less frequently in patients in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided group ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- ) than in the control group ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- ; relative risk @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
Result	Hydration treatment was terminated prematurely because of shortness of breath in three patients in each group .
Conclusion	Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided fluid administration seems to be safe and effective in preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation .

Background	Early infant male circumcision ( EIMC ) is a potential key HIV prevention intervention , providing it can be safely and efficiently implemented in sub-Saharan Africa .
Background	Here , we present results of a randomized noninferiority trial of EIMC comparing the AccuCirc device with Mogen clamp in Zimbabwe .
Method	Between January and June @ , eligible infants were randomized to EIMC through either AccuCirc or Mogen clamp conducted by a doctor , using a @:@ allocation ratio .
Method	Participants were followed for @ days post-EIMC .
Method	Primary outcomes for the trial were EIMC safety and acceptability .
Result	One hundred fifty male infants were enrolled in the trial and circumcised between @ and @ days postpartum ( n = @ AccuCirc ; n = @ Mogen clamp ) .
Result	Twenty-six infants ( @ % ) were born to HIV-infected mothers .
Result	We observed @ moderate adverse events ( AEs ) -LSB- @ % , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ to @ -RSB- in the AccuCirc arm and none ( @ % CI : @ to @ ) in the Mogen clamp arm .
Result	The cumulative incident risk of AEs was @ % higher in the AccuCirc arm compared with the Mogen Clamp arm ( @ % CI : -@ to @ ) .
Result	As the @ % CI excludes the predefined noninferiority margin of @ % , the result provides evidence of noninferiority of AccuCirc compared with the Mogen clamp .
Result	Nearly all mothers ( @ % ) reported great satisfaction with the outcome .
Result	All mothers , regardless of arm said they would recommend EIMC to other parents , and would circumcise their next son .
Conclusion	This first randomized trial of AccuCirc versus Mogen clamp for EIMC demonstrated that EIMC using these devices is safe and acceptable to parents .
Conclusion	There was no difference in the rate of AEs by device .

Background	With a prevalence of @ to @ % among women of reproductive age , severe premenstrual symptoms are very common .
Background	Symptoms range from emotional and cognitive to physical changes .
Background	Severe symptoms ( that is , premenstrual syndrome ) can have a strong impact on everyday functioning and quality of life .
Background	Impairment can be as serious as that of dysthymic disorders .
Background	Many affected women receive either no treatment at all or are unsatisfied with their treatment .
Background	Although there is some evidence for the reduction of distress through cognitive behavioural therapy , there are only a small number of randomised controlled trials carefully investigating the efficacy of this psychotherapeutic approach .
Background	Thus , this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioural self-help treatment for women suffering from premenstrual syndrome .
Method	The study is conducted as a randomised controlled trial .
Method	The complex diagnostic assessment includes the completion of a symptom diary over two consecutive cycles and a telephone interview .
Method	Eligible women are randomly assigned to either a treatment or a wait-list control group .
Method	The intervention is based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles and is provided via the internet .
Method	It consists of @ different modules on which participants work over @ consecutive weeks .
Method	In addition to written information , participants receive email feedback from a clinical psychologist on a weekly basis .
Method	Participants assigned to the wait-list receive the treatment after the end of the waiting period ( @ weeks ) .
Method	The primary outcome measure is the Premenstrual Syndrome Impairment Measure .
Method	Secondary outcomes include the Premenstrual Syndrome Coping Measure , the Short-Form Social Support Questionnaire , the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Relationship Quality , and the Perceived Stress Scale .
Method	Data is collected during the premenstrual ( luteal ) phase at pre-treatment , post-treatment , and @-month follow-up .
Conclusion	So far , there is no study investigating internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for premenstrual syndrome .
Conclusion	The programme approaches the problem of high prevalence in combination with severe impairment and insufficient treatment options .

Problem	Clinical application of an antibiotic 's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) properties may improve the outcome of severe infections .
Problem	No data are available on the use of linezolid ( LNZ ) continuous infusion in critically ill obese patients affected by ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) .
Method	We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare LNZ concentrations in plasma and epithelial lining fluid ( ELF ) , when administered by intermittent and continuous infusion ( II , CI ) , in obese critically ill patients affected by VAP .
Result	Twenty-two critically ill obese patients were enrolled .
Result	At the steady state , in the II group , mean SD total and unbound maximum-minimum concentrations ( C max/C max , u - C min/Cmin , u ) were @ @ / @ @ mg/L and @ @ / @ @ mg/L , respectively .
Result	In the CI group , the mean SD total and unbound plasma concentrations ( C ss and C ss , u ) were @ @ and @ @ mg/L , respectively .
Result	Within a minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) range of @-@ mg/L , the median ( IQR ) time LNZ plasma concentration persisted above MIC ( % T > MIC ) was significantly higher in the CI than the II group -LSB- @ ( @-@ ) vs @ ( @-@ ) , p = @ ; @ ( @-@ ) vs @ ( @-@ @ ) , p = @ ; @ ( @-@ ) vs @ ( @-@ @ ) , p = @ ; respectively -RSB- .
Result	Pulmonary penetration ( % ) was higher in the CI group , as confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation -LSB- @ ( IQR @-@ @ ) vs @ ( IQR @-@ @ ) ; p < @ -RSB- .
Conclusion	In critically ill obese patients affected by VAP , LNZ CI may overcome the limits of standard administration but these advantages are less evident with difficult to treat pathogens ( MIC = @ mg/L ) .
Conclusion	These data support the usefulness of LNZ continuous infusion , combined with therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) , in selected critically ill populations .

Background	Only about a third of patients with an episode of major depressive disorder remit with a given treatment and few remissions occur within the first weeks of treatment .
Background	This study tested whether combining escitalopram and bupropion as initial treatment would result in quicker remission and a higher remission rate than monotherapy with either drug .
Method	Two hundred forty-five outpatients aged @-@ having non-psychotic , non-bipolar major depression were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with bupropion or escitalopram or the combination dosed to a maximum of bupropion @ mg/d and/or escitalopram @ mg/d for @ weeks .
Method	A Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score of @ was required for randomization , while a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score @ defined remission .
Method	We hypothesized that bupropion plus escitalopram would outperform both monotherapies in both earlier onset of remission and higher rate of remission .
Result	Primary analyses did not demonstrate that dual therapy outperformed both monotherapies in either timing of remission or remission rate .
Result	All three treatments were well tolerated .
Conclusion	These results do not support initial use of bupropion plus escitalopram to speed or enhance antidepressant response .

Problem	Commercial diving often occurs in low visibility , where divers are reliant on their tactile senses .
Problem	This study examined the effect of nitrogen narcosis on tactile memory for shapes as well as the influence of psychological and biographical factors on this relationship .
Method	This crossover study tested @ commercial divers in a dry hyperbaric chamber at @ and @ kPa ( @ and @ atmospheres absolute/atm abs ) .
Method	Divers memorized shapes while blindfolded , using their tactile senses only .
Method	Delayed recall was measured at the surface after each dive .
Method	Psychological and biographical data were also collected .
Result	A significant effect of hyperbaric pressure on tactile memory was demonstrated , and a further effect of sequence of testing found .
Result	Thus , divers ' delayed shape recall deteriorated by @ % after learning material at depth , compared to learning on the surface .
Result	There were also significant but small effects of psychological and biographical markers on tactile memory performance , with lower trait anxiety associated with better recall , and lower education associated with poorer recall .
Conclusion	The findings emphasize the importance of utilizing other forms of recording of events or objects at depth , particularly in conditions of low visibility during deeper diving , to aid memory encoding and subsequent recall at the surface .

Background	In VOICE , a multisite HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) trial , plasma drug levels pointed to widespread product nonuse , despite high adherence estimated by self-reports and clinic product counts .
Background	Using a socio-ecological framework ( SEF ) , we explored socio-cultural and contextual factors that influenced participants ' experience of daily vaginal gel and oral tablet regimens in VOICE .
Method	In Johannesburg , a qualitative ancillary study was concurrently conducted among randomly selected VOICE participants assigned to in-depth interviews ( n = @ ) , serial ethnographic interviews ( n = @ ) , or focus group discussions ( n = @ ) .
Method	Audiotaped interviews were transcribed , translated , and coded thematically for analysis .
Result	Of the @ participants , the mean age was @ years , and @ % had a primary sex partner with whom @ % cohabitated .
Result	Few women reported lasting nonuse , which they typically attributed to missed visits , lack of product replenishments , and family-related travel or work .
Result	Women acknowledged occasionally skipping or mistiming doses because they forgot , were busy , felt lazy or bored , feared or experienced side effects .
Result	However , nearly all knew or heard of other study participants who did not use products daily .
Result	Three overarching themes emerged from further analyses : ambivalence toward research , preserving a healthy status , and managing social relationships .
Result	These themes highlighted the profound and complex meanings associated with participating in a blinded HIV PrEP trial and taking antiretroviral-based products .
Result	The unknown efficacy of products , their connection with HIV infection , challenges with daily regimen given social risks , lack of support-from partners and significant others-and the relationship tradeoffs entailed by using the products appear to discourage adequate product use .
Conclusion	Personal acknowledgment of product nonuse was challenging .
Conclusion	This qualitative inquiry highlighted key influences at all SEF levels that shaped women 's perceptions of trial participation and experiences with investigational products .
Conclusion	Whether these impacted women 's behaviors and may have contributed to ineffective trial results warrants further investigation .

Background	A new , highly filled primer is currently marketed as a fluoride delivery system effective in reducing white spot lesions in orthodontic patients .
Background	However , no studies in the literature support this claim .
Background	The purpose of this in-vivo study was to investigate the retention and the efficacy of this primer in reducing the formation of white spot lesions .
Method	In each patient for whom premolar extractions were planned ( n = @ ) , @ premolar was randomly chosen as the experimental tooth for the application of the fluoride delivery system ( Opal Seal ; Ultradent Products , South Jordan , Utah ) , and the contralateral tooth was assigned as the control to receive the standard treatment ( Transbond XT ; @M Unitek , Monrovia , Calif ) .
Method	After the bonding procedures , separators were placed around the premolar brackets to encourage plaque retention over @ weeks .
Method	After the extractions , the tooth surfaces were evaluated visually and with microhardness techniques for demineralization .
Method	Primer retention was also investigated .
Result	There were no statistically significant differences in the numbers of white spot lesions between the @ groups .
Result	The primer retention was calculated as @ % .
Conclusion	The results indicated no significant difference between the efficacies of the fluoride-releasing primer and the control primer in reducing demineralization over the duration of the study .

Problem	To investigate women 's understanding of prenatal testing options and of their own experience with screening , diagnostic genetic testing , or both .
Method	This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of enhanced information and values clarification regarding prenatal genetic testing in the absence of financial barriers to testing .
Method	Women in the third trimester of pregnancy were asked whether they had discussed prenatal genetic testing with their health care providers , whether they understood this testing was optional , and whether they had undergone testing during their pregnancy .
Method	Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to determine independent predictors of these outcomes .
Result	Data were available from @ study participants .
Result	Discussions about screening tests were reported by @ participants ( @ % ) ; only @ ( @ % ) reported discussing diagnostic testing .
Result	That screening and diagnostic testing were optional was evident to approximately two thirds of women ( n = @ and @ , respectively ) .
Result	Recall of actual tests undergone was correct for @ ( @ % ) for screening and for @ ( @ % ) for diagnostic testing .
Result	Racial , ethnic and socioeconomic variation existed in the understanding of whether screening and diagnostic tests were optional and in the correct recall of whether screening had been undertaken in the current pregnancy .
Result	In the usual care group , women receiving care in low-income settings were less likely to recall being offered diagnostic testing ( adjusted odds ratio @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) .
Conclusion	Disparities exist in women 's recall of prenatal genetic testing discussions and their understanding of their own experience .
Conclusion	Interventions that explain testing options to women and help clarify their preferences may help to eliminate these differences .

Background	Despite growing interest in the importance of , and challenges associated with the involvement of patient and population ( IPP ) in the process of developing and adapting clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) , there is a lack of knowledge about the best method to use .
Background	This is especially problematic in the field of rehabilitation , where individuals with disabilities might face many barriers to their involvement in the guideline development and adaptation process .
Background	The goal of this pilot trial is to document the acceptability , feasibility and effectiveness of two methods of involving patients with a disability ( traumatic brain injury ) in CPG development .
Method	A single-blind , randomized , crossover pragmatic trial will be performed with @ patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
Method	They will be randomized into two groups , and each will try two alternative methods of producing recommendations ; a discussion group ( control intervention ) and a Wiki , a webpage that can be modified by those who have access to it ( experimental intervention ) .
Method	The participants will rate the acceptability of the two methods , and feasibility will be assessed using indicators such as the number of participants who accessed and completed the two methods , and the number of support interventions required .
Method	Twenty experts , blinded to the method of producing the recommendations , will independently rate the recommendations produced by the participants for clarity , accuracy , appropriateness and usefulness .
Conclusion	Our trial will allow for the use of optimal IPP methods in a larger project of adapting guidelines for the rehabilitation of individuals with TBI .
Conclusion	Ultimately the results will inform the science of CPG development and contribute to the growing knowledge about IPP in rehabilitation settings .

Problem	To compare the effectiveness of conventional and game-based oral health education on the oral health-related knowledge and oral hygiene status among @ - to @-year-old schoolchildren .
Method	A total of @ children aged @ to @ years were divided into @ groups .
Method	Each group had @ children aged @ to @ years and @ children aged @ to @ years .
Method	A pretest evaluation of their knowledge regarding oral health and the estimation of Debris Index-Simplified ( DI-S ) was carried out .
Method	Children in group A were given oral health education through flash cards once daily for @ days .
Method	Children in group B were educated through the play method ( i.e. snakes and ladders game combined with flash cards ) .
Method	The evaluations regarding oral hygiene and DI-S were recorded on post-intervention day @ and @ months after the intervention .
Result	In group B , high knowledge scores of @ and @ were obtained by the @ - to @-year-olds and @ - to @-yearolds , respectively , on post-intervention day @ .
Result	The lowest mean percentage difference of @ was seen in @ - to @-yearold children of group A after @ months .
Result	In group B ( @-@ and @-@ ) and group A ( @-@ ) there was a significant increase in good oral hygiene scores and a significant decrease in fair and poor debris scores on post-intervention day @ and at the @-month follow-up .
Conclusion	The knowledge scores of both the younger and older groups of children increased considerably when the game-based teaching intervention was used .
Conclusion	Hence , it can be an effective aid for teaching basic oral health concepts to children .

Problem	This study assessed the validity and usefulness of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development , Third Edition ( Bayley-III ) Low Motor/Vision accommodated version .
Problem	Accommodations are adaptations to minimize impairment bias , without altering what the test measures .
Problem	Of the items , @ % have Low Motor accommodations like enlarged materials ; @ % have Low Vision accommodations .
Method	Using a within-subject design , we tested @ children with the accommodated and standard Bayley-III , in a randomly counterbalanced order .
Method	The children had motor and/or visual impairment and a chronological age between @ and @ months .
Method	The test administrators completed an evaluation form .
Result	A subgroup of children benefited from the accommodations ; @ children obtained a large raw score difference .
Result	Test administrators considered the accommodations as practical , and advantageous for most children .
Conclusion	The Low Motor/Vision accommodated version seems to validly assess the development of this population .
Conclusion	Future , larger-scale research should study whether the accommodations improve the construct validity of the Bayley-III .

Background	Based on the early results of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves ( PARTNER ) trial , transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) is an accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable for surgery .
Background	However , little information is available about the late clinical outcomes in such patients .
Method	We did this randomised controlled trial at @ experienced valve centres in Canada , Germany , and the USA .
Method	We enrolled patients with severe symptomatic inoperable aortic stenosis and randomly assigned ( @:@ ) them to transfemoral TAVR or to standard treatment , which often included balloon aortic valvuloplasty .
Method	Patients and their treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation .
Method	The randomisation was done centrally , and sites learned of the assignment only after a patient had been screened , consented , and entered into the database .
Method	The primary outcome of the trial was all-cause mortality at @ year in the intention-to-treat population , here we present the prespecified findings after @ years .
Method	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	We screened @ patients , of whom @ were enrolled ( mean age @ years , Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality @ % , @ % female ) .
Result	@ were assigned to TAVR treatment and @ were assigned to standard treatment .
Result	@ patients crossed over from the standard treatment group and ten withdrew from study , leaving only six patients at @ years , of whom five had aortic valve replacement treatment outside of the study .
Result	The risk of all-cause mortality at @ years was @ % in the TAVR group versus @ % in the standard treatment group ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p < @ ) .
Result	At @ years , @ ( @ % ) of @ survivors in the TAVR group had New York Heart Association class @ or @ symptoms compared with three ( @ % ) of five in the standard treatment group .
Result	Echocardiography after TAVR showed durable haemodynamic benefit ( aortic valve area @ cm ( @ ) at @ years , mean gradient @ mm Hg at @ years ) , with no evidence of structural valve deterioration .
Conclusion	TAVR is more beneficial than standard treatment for treatment of inoperable aortic stenosis .
Conclusion	TAVR should be strongly considered for patients who are not surgical candidates for aortic valve replacement to improve their survival and functional status .
Conclusion	Appropriate selection of patients will help to maximise the benefit of TAVR and reduce mortality from severe comorbidities .

Background	Medication adherence is critical for patient treatment .
Background	This study involved evaluating how implementing Short Message Service ( SMS ) reminders affected patient medication adherence and related factors .
Method	We used a structured questionnaire to survey outpatients at three medical centers .
Method	Patients aged @ years and older who were prescribed more than @ days of a prescription medication were randomized into SMS intervention or control groups .
Method	The intervention group received daily messages reminding them of aspects regarding taking their medication ; the control group received no messages .
Method	A phone follow-up was performed to assess outcomes after @ days .
Method	Data were collected from @ participants in the intervention group and @ participants in the control group .
Result	After participants in the intervention group received SMS reminders to take medication or those in the control group received no messages , incidences of delayed doses were decreased by @ and @ % for those in the control and intervention groups , respectively .
Result	The rate of missed doses was decreased by @ % for participants in the intervention group and @ % for those in the control group .
Result	We applied logistic regression analysis and determined that participants in the intervention group had a @-fold higher probability of having a decrease in delayed doses compared with participants in the control group .
Result	Participants in the intervention group also showed a @-fold higher probability of having a decrease in missed doses compared with participants in the control group .
Conclusion	Use of SMS significantly affected the rates of taking medicine on schedule .
Conclusion	Therefore , daily SMS could be useful for reminding patients to take their medicine on schedule .

Background	Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator , but its impact on morbidity and mortality among infants remains unclear .
Problem	The objective of the study was to prospectively assess the association of vitamin D status with mortality , morbidity , and growth during the first @ y of life .
Method	A prospective cohort of @ HIV-infected and @ HIV-exposed Tanzanian infants enrolled in a randomized trial of multivitamins ( not including vitamin D ) was studied .
Method	Serum @-hydroxyvitamin D -LSB- @ ( OH ) D -RSB- concentrations were measured at @-@ wk of age and infants were followed at monthly clinic visits until @ mo. .
Method	Physicians performed a clinical exam every @ mo or when an illness was noted .
Result	Serum @ ( OH ) D concentrations were ( means SDs ) @ @ ng/mL and @ @ ng/mL for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants , respectively .
Result	Unexpectedly , serum @ ( OH ) D concentrations @ ng/mL were significantly associated with higher mortality as compared to the @-@ @ ng/mL reference for HIV-infected ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) and HIV-exposed ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P < @ ) infants after multivariate adjustment .
Result	We found no statistically significant association between @ ( OH ) D concentrations < @ ng/mL and mortality for HIV-infected ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) and HIV-exposed ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) infants .
Result	Among HIV-exposed infants , @ ( OH ) D concentrations @ ng/mL were significantly associated with clinical -LSB- incidence ratio rate ( IRR ) : @ ; @ % CI : @,@ ; P = @ -RSB- and confirmed ( IRR : @ ; @ % CI : @ ; @ , @ ; P < @ ) malaria diagnoses , whereas concentrations of < @ ng/mL were associated with oral candidiasis ( IRR : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and wasting ( HR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The observational design of this study does not allow for causal interpretation ; however , the results indicate a strong need for additional studies of vitamin D among HIV-infected and - exposed children , particularly in malaria-endemic settings .
Conclusion	The parent trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Background	Changes in diet and exercise have been separately demonstrated to improve Depression , although scientific evidence available is scarce .
Background	In a previously published controlled study , just recommending these and other lifestyle measures ( sleep restriction and sunlight exposure ) in combination once , patients experienced improvements in their depressive symptoms six months later .
Background	In this sample , one in three depressive patients had metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) at baseline .
Background	First line treatment of MetS condition is hygienic-dietetic , being Mediterranean diet and exercise especially important .
Background	Therefore we analyzed if lifestyle recommendations also improved their metabolic profile .
Result	During the sixth month evaluation , a smaller number of patients from the group receiving hygienic-dietary recommendations met MetS criteria comparing with the control group .
Conclusion	This study suggests that costless lifestyle recommendations , such as exercise and Mediterranean diet , have the capacity to promote both mental and physical health in a significant proportion of depressive patients .
Conclusion	Further research is needed to confirm or discard these preliminary findings .

Problem	Renal failure patients were treated with linezolid ( LZD ) for proven or suspected infections by multi-resistant Gram-positive cocci .
Problem	The aim of this study was to determine if dose adjustment of LZD is needed as a function of renal impairment or not , especially that a significant component of LZD is eliminated unchanged in urine .
Method	The single dose pharmacokinetics of LZD was investigated .
Method	Eighteen non-infected male subjects with various degrees of renal impairment ranged from normal to severe chronic impairment were enrolled , including end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients maintained on hemodialysis ( HD ) .
Method	LZD was administered as a single oral @mg dose , and blood samples were drawn at different times and analysed by a validated HPLC assay method .
Method	Plasma profiles were evaluated by non-compartmental and compartmental approaches .
Conclusion	A similar rate and extent of LZD absorption and elimination and comparable body exposure was observed in both healthy subjects and acute renal failure patients .
Conclusion	The extent of LZD exposure was significantly increased by @-fold in ESRD patients in their off-dialysis day .
Conclusion	Furthermore , the t@/@ and MRT values were significantly increased by ~ @ - and @-fold , respectively .
Conclusion	The Vd / F values of LZD did not change with renal function .
Conclusion	A significant decrease in CL/F by ~ @-fold was observed in ESRD patients in their off-dialysis day however , CL/F was significantly increased by ~ @-fold during HD .
Conclusion	Approximately half of the administered LZD dose was removed during the HD session in these selected cohorts of ESRD patients .
Conclusion	LZD was generally well tolerated .
Conclusion	The dose of LZD did not need to be adjusted for patients with acute renal dysfunction or ESRD on HD .
Conclusion	One of the twice-daily doses should be administered after the dialysis session because almost half of the LZD dose was substantially removed by HD .
Conclusion	During the first three dialysis sessions of the treatment course , to avoid potentially ineffective therapy , a supplemental dose of LZD might be given if necessary or the dose of LZD should be administered @h before the beginning of the HD session .
Conclusion	This was to keep LZD levels above the MIC for the organism causing the infection being treated .

Problem	To evaluate the effectiveness of a food safety map as an educational method with English language learners .
Method	English language learner community members ( n = @ ) were assigned randomly to participate in @ of @ experimental conditions : food safety map , cooking class , and control .
Method	Participants in the food safety map and cooking class conditions completed a pre-education demographic and cooking history questionnaire , a post-education knowledge and intention questionnaire , and a @-week post-cooking and food safety habits assessment .
Method	Participants in the control group received no educational training but completed the pre - and @-week post-education assessments .
Result	The cooking class and the map class were both effective in increasing food safety knowledge .
Result	Specifically , by comparing with the control group , they significantly increased participants ' knowledge of safely cooking large meat ( -LSB- df = @ , n = @ -RSB- = @ ; P < @ ; V * = @ ) and correctly refrigerating cooked food ( -LSB- df = @ , n = @ -RSB- = @ , P < @ ; V * = @ ) .
Result	The two class types generated similar positive educational effects on boosting food safety behavioral intention ( measured right after the class ) .
Result	The data collected @ weeks after the classes suggested that individuals who took the classes followed the suggested food behaviors more closely than those in the control group ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The food safety map is simple to use and prepare , beneficial for oral and visual learners , and inexpensive .
Conclusion	Compared with a food safety cooking class , the map produces similar learning and behavioral outcomes .

Problem	To determine the efficacy of tranilast as an adjunctive therapy in conjunctival autograft .
Method	Twenty-nine patients were randomly allocated to the Tranilast Group ( n = @ ) or the Control Group ( n = @ ) .
Method	The Tranilast Group received a subconjunctival injection of @ % tranilast @ days prior to surgery .
Method	Conjunctival autograft was performed in both groups using fibrin sealant and @ % subconjunctival mitomycin C at the end of the surgery .
Method	After the resection of the pterygium , immunohistochemistry was performed with @ cells to identify epithelial cells positive for transforming growth factor - ( TGF - ) .
Method	Subjective symptoms were evaluated using a @-point scale , and the recurrence rate was assessed .
Result	Both groups showed improvements in their symptoms and similar clinical results .
Result	Compared with the Control Group , the Tranilast Group failed to show a decreased recurrence rate ( p = @ ) .
Result	However , the number of epithelial cells expressing TGF - was lower in the Tranilast Group ( @ cells ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ; Control Group , @ cells , @ % CI : @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	Minimal but reversible complications , including glaucoma secondary to corticosteroids and granuloma , occurred during the study .
Conclusion	Tranilast was effective in decreasing the number of pterygium epithelial cells expressing TGF - .

Background	From @ to @ , the annual incidence of inpatient treatment for distal radius fracture in Germany rose from @ to @ per @ @ persons .
Background	It is unclear whether open reduction and volar angle-stable plate osteosynthesis ( ORIF ) , a currently advocated treatment , yields a better functional outcome or quality of life than closed reposition and casting .
Method	In the ORCHID multi-center trial , @ patients aged @ and older with an AO type C distal radial fracture were randomly assigned to ORIF or closed reposition and casting .
Method	Their health-related quality of life and hand/arm function were assessed @ and @ months afterward with the Short Form @ ( SF-@ ) questionnaire and the Disability of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire .
Method	The radiological findings , range of movement of the wrist , and EuroQol-@D ( EQ-@D ) scores were documented as well .
Result	Among the @ patients in the intention-to-treat-analysis , there was no significant difference in SF-@ scores between the two treatment groups at one year ( mean difference , @ points in favor of ORIF ; @ % confidence interval , -@ +@ points ; p = @ ) .
Result	The DASH scores showed moderately strong , but clinically unimportant effects in favor of ORIF , and there was no difference in EQ-@D scores .
Result	ORIF led to better radiological results and wrist mobility at @ months , with comparable results at @ months .
Result	@ of the patients initially allotted to nonsurgical treatment underwent secondary surgery due to significant loss of reduction .
Conclusion	The findings with respect to mobility , functionality , and quality of life at @ months provide marginal and inconsistent evidence for the superiority of volar angle-stable plate osteosynthesis over closed reduction and casting in the treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures .
Conclusion	Primary nonsurgical management is also effective in suitable patients .

Problem	Co-sleeping is associated with disturbance of the natural sleep pattern , including sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness .
Problem	Nocturnal enuresis ( NE ) or bed-wetting , although benign , is a significant cause of distress to affected children and their caregiver ( s ) .
Problem	This study investigated the relationship between co-sleeping and NE in primary school children from China .
Method	Data from a previous sleep study of primary school children from @ cities across China were analyzed .
Method	Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between co-sleeping and NE while controlling for a number of confounding factors .
Method	The prevalence of NE in co-sleeping and non-co-sleeping children in different age groups was evaluated .
Result	The prevalence of co-sleeping and NE in children aged @ to @ years was @ % and @ % , respectively .
Result	Co-sleeping was associated with a higher prevalence of NE in primary school age children ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @-@ @ ; p < @ ) after adjusting for confounding factors .
Result	The differences in the prevalence of NE between co-sleepers and non-co-sleepers were significant in the @-year age group ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) and @ - to @-year age group ( OR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Co-sleeping may increase the risk of NE in primary school children , particularly in those aged @ to @ years .

Background	Atrial fibrillation is a leading preventable cause of recurrent stroke for which early detection and treatment are critical .
Background	However , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and likely to go undetected and untreated in the routine care of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) .
Method	We randomly assigned @ patients @ years of age or older , without known atrial fibrillation , who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous @ months ( cause undetermined after standard tests , including @-hour electrocardiography -LSB- ECG -RSB- ) , to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a @-day event-triggered recorder ( intervention group ) or a conventional @-hour monitor ( control group ) .
Method	The primary outcome was newly detected atrial fibrillation lasting @ seconds or longer within @ days after randomization .
Method	Secondary outcomes included episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting @ minutes or longer and anticoagulation status at @ days .
Result	Atrial fibrillation lasting @ seconds or longer was detected in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the intervention group , as compared with @ of @ ( @ % ) in the control group ( absolute difference , @ percentage points ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P < @ ; number needed to screen , @ ) .
Result	Atrial fibrillation lasting @ minutes or longer was present in @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the intervention group , as compared with @ of @ ( @ % ) in the control group ( absolute difference , @ percentage points ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	By @ days , oral anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for more patients in the intervention group than in the control group ( @ of @ patients -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs. @ of @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; absolute difference , @ percentage points ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA who were @ years of age or older , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was common .
Conclusion	Noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring for a target of @ days significantly improved the detection of atrial fibrillation by a factor of more than five and nearly doubled the rate of anticoagulant treatment , as compared with the standard practice of short-duration ECG monitoring .
Conclusion	( Funded by the Canadian Stroke Network and others ; EMBRACE ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	The autobiographical Implicit Association Test ( aIAT ) is a variant of the Implicit Association Test reportedly capable of detecting an individual 's concealed autobiographical event with very high accuracy .
Background	A previous attempt to utilize this measurement technique for the identification of cocaine users rendered an alarming rate of false positives .
Background	In this study , we aimed to explore the potential reasons behind the measurement 's inaccuracy .
Method	Two versions of the cocaine aIAT were devised with different category labels ( descriptive ` guilty/innocent ' and self-referenced ` as if you were/were not ' ) .
Method	Forty-one cocaine abstinent participants ( @ % male ; mean age = @ @ ) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions .
Method	Self-declared cocaine abstinence was confirmed for the @-month period preceding data collection through hair analysis .
Method	Participants were also administered bespoke implicit and explicit cocaine user attitude measures , the self-esteem IAT and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale .
Result	The category labels which elicited self-referenced knowledge showed low accuracy ( @ % ) compared to the @ % of the ` guilty/innocent ' labels proposed by original authors .
Result	The self-referenced aIAT version significantly correlated with the self-concept measures .
Result	The aIAT outcomes were independent from attitudes toward cocaine users .
Conclusion	Category labels play an influential role in determining the test 's accuracy , demonstrating that participants ' propositional knowledge and self-concept are involved during test performance .
Conclusion	The aIAT does not appear to tap directly into an individual 's implicit memory when relevant memory is not available .
Conclusion	Although the test can not be recommended for detecting drug use , further research should investigate underlying mechanisms and other potentials of the technique .

Problem	We evaluated patients at tertiary -LSB- both percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) and coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) capable -RSB- and primary hospitals in the EARLY-ACS trial .
Background	Early invasive management is recommended for high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes .
Method	We evaluated outcomes in @,@ patients presenting to : tertiary sites , primary sites with transfer to tertiary sites ( `` transferred '' ) and those who remained at primary sites ( `` non-transfer '' ) .
Result	There were @ tertiary ( n = @,@ patients ) and @ primary hospitals -LSB- n = @,@ patients ( @ transferred ; @,@ non-transfer ) -RSB- .
Result	Significant delays occurred in time from symptom onset to angiography ( @ hr ) , PCI ( @h ) , and CABG ( @ hr ) for transferred patients ( P < @ ) .
Result	Non-transfer patients had less @-day death/myocardial infarction -LSB- @ % vs. @ % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- ; transferred ( @ % ) and tertiary patients were similar -LSB- adjusted OR : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	Non-transfer patients had lower @-year mortality -LSB- @ % vs. @ % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- : there was no difference between transferred and tertiary patients -LSB- @ % vs. @ % ; adjusted HR : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	Despite similar rates of catheterization , GUSTO severe/moderate bleeding within @ hr was less in non-transfer -LSB- @ % vs. @ % ( tertiary ) ; adjusted OR : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P < @ -RSB- , whereas transferred ( @ % ) and tertiary patients were similar -LSB- adjusted OR : @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	There was no difference in non-CABG bleeding .
Conclusion	Timely angiography and revascularization were often not achieved in transferred patients .
Conclusion	Non-transferred patients presenting to primary sites had the lowest event rates and the best long-term survival .

Background	Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by reversible obstruction , inflammation and hyperresponsiveness to different stimulus .
Background	Aerobic and breathing exercises have been demonstrated to benefit asthmatic patients ; however , there is no evidence comparing the effectiveness of these treatments .
Method	This is a prospective , comparative , blinded , and randomized clinical trial with @ groups that will receive distinct interventions .
Method	Forty-eight asthmatic adults with optimized medical treatment will be randomly divided into either aerobic ( AG ) or breathing exercises ( BG ) .
Method	Patients will perform breathing or aerobic exercise twice a week for @months , totalizing @ sessions of @minutes each .
Method	Before intervention , both groups will complete an educational program consisting of @ educational classes .
Method	Before and after interventions , the following parameters will be quantified : clinical control ( main outcome ) , health related quality of life , levels of anxiety and depression , daily living physical activity and maximal exercise capacity ( secondary outcome ) .
Method	Hyperventilation syndrome symptoms , autonomic nervous imbalance , thoracoabdominal kinematics , inflammatory cells in the sputum , fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO ) and systemic inflammatory cytokines will also be evaluated as possible mechanisms to explain the benefits of both interventions .
Conclusion	Although the benefits of breathing and aerobic exercises have been extensively studied , the comparison between both has never been investigated .
Conclusion	Furthermore , the findings of our results will allow us to understand its application and suitability to patients that will have more benefits for every intervention optimizing its effect .

Problem	To evaluate and compare the effects of @ manual therapy interventions on cervical spine range of motion ( ROM ) , head repositioning accuracy , and balance in patients with chronic cervicogenic dizziness .
Method	Randomized controlled trial with @-week follow-up using blinded outcome assessment .
Method	University School of Health Sciences .
Method	Participants ( N = @ ; mean age SD , @ @ y ; @ % women ) with chronic cervicogenic dizziness .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to @ of @ groups : sustained natural apophyseal glides ( SNAGs ) with self-SNAG exercises , passive joint mobilization ( PJM ) with ROM exercises , or a placebo .
Method	Participants each received @ to @ treatments over @ weeks .
Method	Cervical ROM , head repositioning accuracy , and balance .
Result	SNAG therapy resulted in improved ( P @ ) cervical spine ROM in all @ physiological cervical spine movement directions immediately posttreatment and at @ weeks .
Result	Treatment with PJM resulted in improvement in @ of the @ cervical movement directions posttreatment and @ movement direction at @ weeks .
Result	There was a greater improvement ( P < @ ) after SNAGs than PJM in extension ( mean difference , -@ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ to -@ ) and right rotation ( mean difference , -@ ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) posttreatment .
Result	Manual therapy had no effect on balance or head repositioning accuracy .
Conclusion	SNAG treatment improved cervical ROM , and the effects were maintained for @ weeks after treatment .
Conclusion	PJM had very limited impact on cervical ROM .
Conclusion	There was no conclusive effect of SNAGs or PJMs on joint repositioning accuracy or balance in people with cervicogenic dizziness .

Problem	Eye movements ( EM ) during recall of an aversive memory is a treatment element unique to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) .
Problem	Experimental studies have shown that EM reduce memory vividness and/or emotionality shortly after the intervention .
Problem	However , it is unclear whether the immediate effects of the intervention reflect actual changes in memory .
Problem	The aim of this study was to test whether immediate reductions in memory vividness and emotionality persist at a @h follow up and whether the magnitude of these effects is related to the duration of the intervention .
Method	Seventy-three undergraduates recalled two negative autobiographical memories , one with EM ( `` recall with EM '' ) and one without ( `` recall only '' ) .
Method	Half of participants recalled each memory for four periods of @s , the other half for eight periods of @s .
Method	Memory vividness/emotionality were self-rated at a pre-test , an immediate post-test , and a @h follow-up test .
Result	In both duration groups , recall with EM , but not recall only , caused an immediate decrease in memory vividness .
Result	There were no immediate reductions in memory emotionality .
Result	Furthermore , only the ` eight periods ' group showed that recall with EM , but not recall only , caused a decrease in both memory emotionality and memory vividness from the pre-test to the follow-up .
Conclusion	Only self-report measures were used .
Conclusion	The findings suggest that recall with EM causes @-hchanges in memory vividness/emotionality , which may explain part of the EMDR treatment effect , and these effects are related to intervention duration .

Background	The stimulant prodrug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate ( LDX ) is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Background	Positive impacts of LDX on health-related quality of life and functional impairment have previously been demonstrated in a @-week , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase III study in children and adolescents in Europe .
Background	Maintenance of these broad benefits , as well as symptomatic control , is a key goal of long-term management of ADHD .
Problem	Secondary objectives of this multinational study in children and adolescents with ADHD were to assess the long-term maintenance of effectiveness of LDX in improving health-related quality of life and reducing functional impairment , as gauged using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition : Parent Report Form ( CHIP-CE : PRF ) and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report ( WFIRS-P ) , respectively .
Method	Patients aged @-@ years with diagnosed ADHD and a baseline ADHD Rating Scale IV total score of at least @ were enrolled from the previous European study and from US sites .
Method	Patients who completed an open-label LDX treatment period of at least @ weeks were randomized ( @:@ ) to continue on their optimized dose of LDX or to switch to placebo for a @-week , double-blind , withdrawal period .
Method	Parents completed CHIP-CE : PRF and WFIRS-P questionnaires at weeks @ , @ and @ of the open-label period and at weeks @ and @ of the randomized-withdrawal period , or at early termination .
Method	The endpoint of each period was defined as the last visit with valid data .
Method	Effect sizes were the difference ( LDX minus placebo ) in least-squares ( LS ) - mean change from baseline to endpoint divided by root-mean-square error .
Method	P values were nominal and not adjusted for multiple comparisons .
Result	The open-label and randomized full analysis sets comprised @ and @ ( LDX n = @ ; placebo n = @ ) patients , respectively .
Result	Mean pretreatment CHIP-CE : PRF T-scores were more than one standard deviation below the normative mean in four of the five domains , and there was significant improvement across all domains from baseline to endpoint of the open-label period .
Result	In the randomized-withdrawal period , LS-mean CHIP-CE : PRF T-scores deteriorated in all domains in the placebo group , but not in the LDX group .
Result	Compared with placebo , the effect of LDX was significant in the Risk Avoidance ( effect size @ ; p < @ ) , Achievement ( @ ; p < @ ) and Satisfaction ( @ ; p < @ ) domains .
Result	Mean pretreatment WFIRS-P scores were lowest in the Family domain and the Learning and School domain .
Result	WFIRS-P total score and scores in all domains improved significantly from baseline to endpoint of the open-label period .
Result	In the randomized-withdrawal period , LS-mean scores deteriorated in the placebo group but not in the LDX group .
Result	Compared with placebo , the effect of LDX was significant in the Family , Learning and School , and Risky Activities domains and in total ( effect size @ ; p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Using parent-rated instruments , long-term maintenance of the beneficial effect of LDX in multiple domains of health-related quality of life and functional impairment was demonstrated by comparison of treatment continuation and withdrawal under randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled conditions .

Method	A novel , fully bacterially produced recombinant virus-like particle ( VLP ) based influenza vaccine ( gH@-Qbeta ) against A/California/@ / @ ( H@N@ ) was tested in a double-blind , randomized phase I clinical trial at two clinical sites in Singapore .
Method	The trial evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of gH@-Qbeta in the presence or absence of alhydrogel adjuvant .
Method	Healthy adult volunteers with no or low pre-existing immunity against A/California/@ / @ ( H@N@ ) were randomized to receive two intramuscular injections @ days apart , with @g vaccine , containing @g hemagglutinin antigen .
Method	Antibody responses were measured before and @ days after each immunization by hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assays .
Method	The primary endpoint was seroconversion on Day @ , defined as percentage of subjects which reach a HAI titer @ or achieve an at least @-fold rise in HAI titer ( with pre-existing immunity ) .
Method	The co-secondary endpoints were safety and seroconversion on Day @ .
Result	A total of @ Asian volunteers were enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the adjuvanted ( n = @ ) or the non-adjuvanted ( n = @ ) vaccine .
Result	Of those , @ and @ respectively ( @ % ) completed the study .
Result	There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported during this trial .
Result	A total of @ adverse events occurred during treatment with @ % local solicited symptoms , of mostly ( @ % ) mild severity .
Result	The most common treatment-related systemic symptom was fatigue .
Result	The non-adjuvanted vaccine met all primary and secondary endpoints and showed seroconversion in @ % and @ % of participants respectively on Day @ and Day @ .
Result	While the adjuvanted vaccine showed an increased seroconversion from @ % ( Day @ ) to @ % ( Day @ ) , it did not meet the immunogenicity endpoint .
Conclusion	In summary , non-adjuvanted gH@-Qbeta showed similar antibody mediated immunogenicity and a comparable safety profile in healthy humans to commercially available vaccines .
Conclusion	These results warrant the consideration of this VLP vaccine platform for the vaccination against influenza infection ( HSA CTC@ ) .

Problem	The preferred approach to the management of common bile duct ( CBD ) stones is uncertain , with single-stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration vs. two-stage preoperative endoscopic CBD clearance followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy being debated .
Problem	To address this , a prospective randomized study which compared these two management strategies was undertaken .
Method	Between Jan @ and Dec @ , patients with gallstones and common bile duct stones diagnosed by preoperative ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were randomized to single-stage vs. two-stage treatment .
Method	In a single-stage group , laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration were undertaken at the same operation , whereas in a two-stage group , endoscopic stone clearance was followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy @-@ days later .
Method	Early treatment success and complications and longer-term follow-up for the two groups were compared .
Result	Two hundred twenty-one patients were enrolled in the trial , @ in the single-stage group and @ in the two-stage group .
Result	There was no significant difference in the success rate of CBD clearance ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) or the complication rates ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) between the groups .
Result	However , at longer-term follow-up , recurrent CBD stones were seen more often in the two-stage group ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The single-stage and two-stage approaches were equally effective in achieving initial clearance of CBD stones .
Conclusion	However , recurrent CBD stones occurred more commonly in patients who had undergone two-stage treatment with initial endoscopic stone clearance , followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy .

Problem	To explore the necessity of interrupting nerve fibers of bypass thoracic sympathetic chain during edoscopic sympathicotomy ( ETS ) for palmar hyperhidrosis .
Method	Randomized controlled trial was performed for @ patients of severe palmar hyperhidrosis from January @ to June @ .
Method	They were randomly divided into @ groups of R@ thoracic sympathctomy ( R@ ) and R@ thoracic sympathicotomy plus bypass fiber resection at the same level ( R@ + ) ( n = @ each ) .
Method	Clinical observations were recorded during a follow-up period of @ years .
Result	The curative rates of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis were @ % for two groups .
Result	No statistically significant inter-group difference existed in left hand temperature increase after transecting thoracic sympathetic nerve ( @ @ C vs @ @ C ) , right hand increase ( @ @ C vs @ @ C ) , incidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis ( @ % vs @ % ) , recurrence rate ( @ % vs @ % ) and postoperative satisfaction rate ( @ % vs @ % ) .
Result	But pain scores of R@ group was significantly lower than those of R@ + group ( @ @ vs @ @ , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Simple transaction of thoracic sympathetic chain during ETS is sufficient in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis .
Conclusion	And it is unnecessary to transect bypass fibers .

Background	The relative performance of ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin sealant in preventing fissure caries in permanent molars was compared in a randomized clinical trial conducted in southern China ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT@ ) .
Method	After obtaining ethical approval , healthy schoolchildren who had permanent first molars with occlusal fissures which were sound but deep or presented with only incipient caries were recruited for the study .
Method	Included molars were randomly allocated into one of four parallel study groups in units of left/right teeth per mouth .
Method	Two of the four groups adopted the methods of ART or fluoride-releasing resin sealant placement while the other two groups adopted the topical fluoride application methods .
Method	Fissure status of the molars in each group was evaluated every @ months .
Method	Development of dentine caries and sealant retention over @ months in the molars in the two sealant-using groups was compared in this report .
Method	Outcome on cost-effectiveness of all four groups over @ months will be reported elsewhere .
Result	At baseline , a total of @ children ( @ molars ) with mean age @ years were involved for the two sealant groups .
Result	After @ months , @ children ( @ molars ) were followed .
Result	Proportions of molars with dentine caries were @ % and @ % in the ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin sealant groups , respectively ( chi-square test , p = @ ) .
Result	Life-table survival analysis showed that sealant retention ( full and partial ) rate over @ months for the resin sealant ( @ % ) was significantly higher than that ( @ % ) for the ART sealant ( p < @ ) .
Result	Molar survival ( no development of dentine caries ) rates in the ART sealant ( @ % ) and fluoride-releasing resin sealant ( @ % ) groups were not significantly different ( p = @ ) .
Result	Multilevel logistic regression ( GEE modeling ) accounting for the effects of data clustering and confounding factors confirmed this finding .
Conclusion	Though the retention of fluoride-releasing resin sealant was better than that of the ART sealant , their effectiveness in preventing fissure caries in permanent molars did not differ significantly over @ months .
Conclusion	ART sealants could be a good alternative when and where resources for resin sealant placement are not readily available .

Background	Patients with diabetes often develop ocular complications .
Background	The most common and most blinding of these complications , however , is diabetic retinopathy .
Background	The objective of this study was to compare the retinal neovessels regression in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) treated with Pan Retinal Photocoagulation ( PRP ) versus panretinal photocoagulation plus Intra Vitreal Bevacizumab ( IVB ) .
Method	A comparative study was conducted at Khyber Institute of Ophthalmic Medical Sciences , Hayatabad Medical Complex , Peshawar from @st October @ to @st August @ .
Method	A total of @ eyes were randomised into two groups .
Method	Neovessels status was assessed before and at every follow up visit .
Method	Neo Vessels on the Disc ( NVDs ) were assessed as per percentage of NVD occupying the disc surface whereas Neo Vessels Elsewhere ( NVE ) were also assessed as per reference to disc surface diameter .
Result	Neovascularization on the disc was @ + / - @ % at presentation which increased to @ + / - @ % on @th day and stabilised to @ + / - @ % on day @ in PRP group .
Result	In PRP-plus group , @ + / - @ % NVD regressed to @ + / - @ % on @th day and @ + / - @ % on day @ .
Result	The NVE in PRP group was @ + / - @ % at baseline , @ + / - @ % on @th day , and @ + / - @ % on day @ .
Result	In PRP-plus group it was @ + / - @ % at baseline , @ + / - @ % on day @ , and @ + / - @ % on day @ .
Result	On day @ both the groups had highly significant different NVD ( p = @ ) and NVE ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Intra Vitreal Bevacizumab in short term is effective as adjunctive treatment to PRP with early and higher rate of retinal neovessels regression than PRP alone in PDR patients .

Problem	To evaluate the effect of finasteride on serum androst-@-ene-@ ,@ - dione ( androstenedione ) and its association with prostate cancer risk among subjects who participated in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial .
Method	We analyzed serum androstenedione levels in @ prostate cancer cases and @ controls , nested in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial , a randomized placebo-controlled trial that found finasteride decreased prostate cancer risk .
Method	Androstenedione is the second most important circulating androgen in men besides testosterone and also a substrate for @-reductase enzyme .
Result	We observed a @ % increase in androstenedione levels compared with the baseline values in subjects who were treated with finasteride for @ years .
Result	This significant increase did not vary by case-control status .
Result	Adjusted odds ratio and @ % confidence interval for the third tertile of absolute change in androstenedione levels compared with the first tertile were @ ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) for low-grade ( Gleason score < @ ) cases .
Result	Similar results were observed when analyzed using percent change .
Result	There were no significant associations between serum androstenedione levels and the risk of high-grade disease .
Conclusion	The results of this nested case-control study confirm that finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) and of androstenedione to @-androstanedione-@ ,@ - dione , which also leads to the reduction of DHT formation .
Conclusion	This decrease in DHT may help reduce the risk of low-grade prostate cancer in men .
Conclusion	Our data on a differential effect of androstenedione also suggest that some high-grade prostate cancers may not require androgen for progression .

Problem	Violence and injury risk behaviors , alcohol and drug use problems , and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and depressive symptoms occur frequently among adolescents presenting to acute care medical settings after traumatic physical injury .
Problem	To test the effectiveness of a stepped collaborative care intervention targeting this constellation of risk behaviors and symptoms in randomly sampled hospitalized adolescents with and without traumatic brain injury .
Method	A pragmatic randomized clinical trial was conducted at a single US level I trauma center .
Method	Participants included @ adolescents aged @ to @ years randomized to intervention ( n = @ ) and control ( n = @ ) conditions .
Method	Stepped collaborative care intervention included motivational interviewing elements targeting risk behaviors and substance use as well as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy elements targeting PTSD and depressive symptoms .
Method	Adolescents were assessed at baseline before randomization and @ , @ , and @ months after injury hospitalization .
Method	Standardized instruments were used to assess violence risk behaviors , alcohol and drug use , and PTSD and depressive symptoms .
Result	The investigation attained more than @ % adolescent follow-up at each assessment point .
Result	At baseline , approximately one-third of the participants endorsed the violence risk behavior of carrying a weapon .
Result	Regression analyses demonstrated that intervention patients experienced significant reductions in weapon carrying compared with controls during the year after injury ( grouptime effect , F@ ,@ = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	At @ months after the injury , @ ( @ % ) intervention patients vs @ ( @ % ) control patients reported currently carrying a weapon ( relative risk ,@ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
Result	The intervention was equally effective in reducing the risk of weapon carrying among injured adolescents with and without traumatic brain injury .
Result	Other treatment targets , including alcohol and drug use problems and high levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms , occurred less frequently in the cohort relative to weapon carrying and were not significantly affected by the intervention .
Conclusion	Collaborative care intervention reduced the risk of adolescent weapon carrying during the year after the injury hospitalization .
Conclusion	Future investigation should replicate this preliminary observation .
Conclusion	If the finding is replicated , orchestrated investigative and policy efforts could systematically implement and evaluate screening and intervention procedures targeting youth violence prevention at US trauma centers .

Problem	The primary objective was to compare the cosmetic outcomes of traumatic trunk and extremity lacerations repaired using absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures .
Problem	The secondary objective was to compare complication rates between the two groups .
Method	This was a randomized controlled trial comparing wounds repaired with Vicryl Rapide and Prolene sutures .
Method	Pediatric and adult patients with lacerations were enrolled in the study .
Method	At a @-day follow-up , the wounds were evaluated for infection and dehiscence .
Method	After @ months , patients returned to have the wounds photographed .
Method	Two plastic surgeons blinded to the method of closure rated the cosmetic outcome of each wound using a @-mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
Method	Using a noninferiority design , a VAS score of @ mm or greater was considered to be a clinically significant difference .
Method	We used a Student 's t-test to compare differences between mean VAS scores and odds ratios ( ORs ) to compare differences in complication rates between the two groups .
Result	Of the @ patients enrolled , @ completed the study including @ in the Vicryl Rapide group and @ in the Prolene group .
Result	The mean ( SD ) age of patients who completed the study was @ ( @ ) years , and @ were male .
Result	We found no significant differences in the age , race , sex , length of wound , number of sutures , or layers of repair in the two groups .
Result	The observer 's mean VAS for the Vicryl Rapide group was @ mm ( @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = @ to @ mm ) and for the Prolene group was @ mm ( @ % CI = @ to @ mm ) .
Result	The resulting mean difference was @ mm ( @ % CI = -@ to @ mm ; p = @ ) ; thus noninferiority was established .
Result	Statistical testing showed no differences in the rates of complications between the two groups , but a higher percentage of the Vicryl Rapide wounds developed complications .
Conclusion	The use of absorbable sutures for the repair of simple lacerations on the trunk and extremities should be considered as an alternative to nonabsorbable suture repair .

Problem	White rice is the main staple for the majority in the world .
Problem	The effects of protein , fat and vegetables on the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to a white rice-based meal have not been reported .
Problem	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of co-ingesting a high-protein food ( breast chicken ) , a fat ( ground nut oil ) , a leafy vegetable or all three on the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of white rice in healthy adults .
Method	This was a randomized crossover trial conducted at the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre in Singapore .
Method	Twelve healthy volunteers were given five test meals ( white rice alone , white rice with chicken , white rice with oil , white rice with vegetable and white rice with chicken , oil and vegetable ) once and the reference food ( glucose solution ) three times in a random order at @-week intervals .
Method	Capillary blood samples were then drawn serially for @ h , and glucose and insulin were analysed .
Result	The glycaemic response ( GR ) to white rice with chicken breast , ground nut oil and vegetable was significantly lower than to white rice alone .
Result	The glycaemic index ( GI ) of pure white rice was @ , whereas combined with chicken breast , ground nut oil and vegetable , it was @ .
Result	The addition of oil delayed the peak glucose response and reduced the iAUC , resulting in a GI value of @ .
Result	The addition of chicken and vegetable resulted in a GI value of @ and @ , respectively .
Result	The insulinaemic index ( II ) of the white rice-based meals varied between @ and @ .
Result	Chicken breast in the meal increased the insulinaemic response and decreased the GR .
Result	White rice II was lower than the glucose control , which indicated that the former was not as insulinogenic as the latter .
Result	White rice with vegetable had the lowest II .
Conclusion	Co-ingesting chicken , oil or vegetable with white rice considerably influences its glycaemic and insulinaemic responses .
Conclusion	Co-ingesting white rice with all three components attenuates the GR to a greater degree than when it is eaten with any single one of them , and that this is not at the cost of an increased demand for insulin .

Background	In early postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH ) , a low concentration of fibrinogen is associated with excessive subsequent bleeding and blood transfusion .
Background	We hypothesized that pre-emptive treatment with fibrinogen concentrate reduces the need for red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion in patients with PPH .
Method	In this investigator-initiated , multicentre , double-blinded , parallel randomized controlled trial , we assigned subjects with severe PPH to a single dose of fibrinogen concentrate or placebo ( saline ) .
Method	A dose of @ g or equivalent was given to all subjects independent of body weight and the fibrinogen concentration at inclusion .
Method	The primary outcome was RBC transfusion up to @ weeks postpartum .
Method	Secondary outcomes were total blood loss , total amount of blood transfused , occurrence of rebleeding , haemoglobin < @ g litre ( -@ ) , RBC transfusion within @ h , @ h , and @ days , and as a composite outcome of ` severe PPH ' , defined as a decrease in haemoglobin of > @ g litre ( -@ ) , transfusion of at least @ units of RBCs , haemostatic intervention ( angiographic embolization , surgical arterial ligation , or hysterectomy ) , or maternal death .
Result	Of the @ randomized subjects , @ of @ in the fibrinogen group and @ of @ in the placebo group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis .
Result	At inclusion the subjects had severe PPH , with a mean blood loss of @ ( sd @ ) ml and a mean fibrinogen concentration of @ ( sd @ ) g litre ( -@ ) .
Result	The intervention group received a mean dose of @ mg kg ( -@ ) fibrinogen concentrate , thereby significantly increasing fibrinogen concentration compared with placebo by @ g litre ( -@ ) ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	Postpartum blood transfusion occurred in @ ( @ % ) of the fibrinogen group and @ ( @ % ) of the placebo group ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	We found no difference in any predefined secondary outcomes , per-protocol analyses , or adjusted analyses .
Result	No thromboembolic events were detected .
Conclusion	We found no evidence for the use of @ g fibrinogen concentrate as pre-emptive treatment for severe PPH in patients with normofibrinogenaemia .

Problem	Despite increasing trends toward the early initiation of oral feeding after gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgeries , current evidence has not been convincing .
Problem	The present randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of early oral feeding ( EOF ) with late oral feeding ( LOF ) following surgery for upper GI tumors .
Method	One hundred and nine consecutive patients with esophageal or gastric tumors undergoing surgical resection in two hospitals in Tehran , Iran , were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial , and were randomly assigned to a group starting EOF on the first postoperative day and another group that remained nil by mouth until the return of bowel sounds ( LOF group ) .
Method	The clinical and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups .
Result	The clinical outcomes were significantly better in the patients in the EOF group ( p < @ ) .
Result	Repeated nil per os ( @ vs. @ % ) and re-hospitalization ( @ vs. @ % ) were more common in LOF group ( p < @ ) .
Result	Additionally , gas passage , nasogastric tube ( NGT ) discharge , a decrease in intravenous serum to less than @ ml per day , the time to start a soft diet and hospital discharge following surgery occurred significantly earlier in the EOF group than in the LOF group ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Early oral feeding after the surgical resection of esophageal and gastric tumors is safe , and is associated with favorable early in-hospital outcomes and a sooner return to physiological GI function and hospital discharge .

Background	There is little evidence to inform the targeted treatment of individuals found early in the diabetes disease trajectory .
Problem	To describe cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk profiles and treatment of individual CVD risk factors by modelled CVD risk at diagnosis ; changes in treatment , modelled CVD risk , and CVD risk factors in the @ years following diagnosis ; and how these are patterned by socioeconomic status .
Method	Cohort analysis of a cluster-randomised trial ( ADDITION-Europe ) in general practices in Denmark , England , and the Netherlands .
Method	A total of @ individuals with screen-detected diabetes were divided into quartiles of modelled @-year CVD risk at diagnosis .
Method	Changes in treatment , modelled CVD risk , and CVD risk factors were assessed at @ years .
Result	The largest reductions in risk factors and modelled CVD risk were seen in participants who were in the highest quartile of modelled risk at baseline , suggesting that treatment was offered appropriately .
Result	Participants in the lowest quartile of risk at baseline had very similar levels of modelled CVD risk at @ years and showed the least variation in change in modelled risk .
Result	No association was found between socioeconomic status and changes in CVD risk factors , suggesting that treatment was equitable .
Conclusion	Diabetes management requires setting of individualised attainable targets .
Conclusion	This analysis provides a reference point for patients , clinicians , and policymakers when considering goals for changes in risk factors early in the course of the disease that account for the diverse cardiometabolic profile present in individuals who are newly diagnosed with type @ diabetes .

Problem	Metastatic colon cancer patients are treated with the chemotherapy regimens , FOLFOX and FOLFIRI , in either order .
Problem	So far , we can not predict the response of chemotherapeutic agent , so it is necessary to find which regimen is adequate before starting chemotherapy .
Method	Enrolled patients are randomized into either conventional treatment or planned treatment preceded by pretreatment genetic analysis .
Method	Blood samples of patients in planned treatment group ( N = @ ) were analyzed for the genetic polymorphism before selection of chemotherapeutic agents .
Method	Target genes were XPD-@ , GSTP-@-@ , XRCC@-@ for oxaliplatin , UGT@A@ for irinotecan .
Method	The response was measured by computed tomographic scan after completion of three cycles of chemotherapy .
Result	Overall response rate was significantly higher in planned group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	In FOLFOX group , response rate was significantly improved in the planned patients ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
Result	In FOLFIRI group , the difference did n't reach statistical significance ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	We found significantly improved response rates in the chemotherapy of metastatic colon cancer by pretreatment genetic analysis , especially in FOLFOX group .

Background	To address the high prevalence of neck dysfunction in helicopter aircrew , a @-wk training program was designed to examine the effects on neck muscular strength and endurance .
Method	Subjects were recruited from Canadian Forces ( CF ) helicopter aircrew and randomized into either a neck coordination training program ( CTP ; N = @ ) , an endurance training program ( ETP ; N = @ ) , or a nontreatment control ( CON ; N = @ ) .
Method	Baseline assessments determined maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) strength and endurance capacity using a submaximal contraction to fatigue at @ % of their MVC for extension , flexion , and left ( Ltflx ) and right ( Rtflx ) lateral flexion .
Method	The ETP subjects performed dynamic contractions at @ % of their MVC in the four testing directions using a head harness and Thera-band tubing .
Method	The CTP consisted of exercises that focused on strengthening the deep cervical musculature using the mass of the head as resistance and progressing to exercises that incorporated the superficial cervical muscles .
Result	Post-intervention , the ETP achieved the only statistically significant increase in maximal force when compared to the CON ( @ % ) .
Result	Improved times to fatigue were achieved by the CTP for flexion ( @ + / - @ s ) , Ltflx ( @ + / - @ s ) , and Rtflx ( @ + / - @ s ) .
Conclusion	The provision of an ETP and CTP resulted in a positive trend toward improved maximal force and muscular endurance .
Conclusion	The greatest improvements in endurance and strength were found for those subjects assigned to the CTP treatment .
Conclusion	Our research demonstrates the importance of including a designed and supervised training program into the daily routine of helicopter aviators .

Background	Opioid-induced constipation is common and debilitating .
Background	We investigated the efficacy and safety of naloxegol , an oral , peripherally acting , - opioid receptor antagonist , for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation .
Method	In two identical phase @ , double-blind studies ( study @ , @ participants ; study @ , @ participants ) , outpatients with noncancer pain and opioid-induced constipation were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of @ or @ mg of naloxegol or placebo .
Method	The primary end point was the @-week response rate ( @ spontaneous bowel movements per week and an increase from baseline of @ spontaneous bowel movements for @ of @ weeks and for @ of the final @ weeks ) in the intention-to-treat population .
Method	The key secondary end points were the response rate in the subpopulation of patients with an inadequate response to laxatives before enrollment , time to first postdose spontaneous bowel movement , and mean number of days per week with one or more spontaneous bowel movements .

Conclusion	DTaP@-IPV-Hib-HepB provides a new combination vaccine option aligned with the recommended US infant immunization schedule .

Background	Previous studies reported increased white blood cell counts ( WBCCs ) , an inflammatory marker , in hypertension , prehypertension and metabolic syndrome .
Background	Evidence suggests that inflammation precedes blood pressure ( BP ) elevation and may contribute to incident hypertension .
Background	Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) may reduce inflammation .
Background	We analyzed WBCC trends in TRial Of Preventing HYpertension ( TROPHY ) to determine if this inflammatory marker predicted incident hypertension in prehypertensive individuals and whether randomized assignment to the ARB candesartan ( @ individuals ) for @ years , lowered WBCC compared with placebo-treated controls ( @ individuals ) .
Method	A new analysis of TROPHY trial data .
Result	In the total population , baseline BMI correlated with WBCC ( r = @ , P < @ ) , neutrophils ( r = @ , P < @ ) and lymphocytes ( r = @ , P < @ ) .
Result	Baseline triglycerides also correlated significantly with inflammatory markers .
Result	Despite a wide range of home BP ( HBP ) values , HBP did not correlate with baseline WBCC counts .
Result	After @ years , candesartan decreased placebo corrected HBP by -@ / -@ mmHg , ( P < @ ) , but WBCC , neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were not different in placebo and in candesartan groups .
Result	Baseline WBCC , neutrophils and lymphocyte counts did not predict incident hypertension in the placebo group .
Conclusion	In TROPHY , candesartan lowered BP but did not alter WBCC .
Conclusion	Baseline WBCC did not predict incident hypertension .
Conclusion	Our findings do not support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to incident hypertension or that ARB treatment suppresses inflammation .
Conclusion	The significant independent association of WBCC with baseline BMI and triglycerides is consistent with the evidence that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with inflammation .
Conclusion	The findings highlight the importance of effective lifestyle modification in prehypertension to reduce inflammatory cardio-metabolic risk and suppress transition to hypertension .

Background	The efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) has been established .
Background	The objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety in the Central African Republic ( CAR ) of three commercially available artemisinin-based combinations , artemether + lumefantrine ( AL ) , artesunate + sulphamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine ( AS-SMP ) and artesunate + amodiaquine ( AS-AQ ) , with those of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine + amodiaquine ( SP-AQ ) , which was the first-line reference treatment in the country from @ , until it was replaced by ACT in @ in accordance with changes in international recommendations based on resistance identified in other regions .
Method	Children aged six to @ months with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited in Bangui , the capital of the CAR .
Method	The @ patients selected were randomly assigned to receive AL ( n = @ ) , AS-SMP ( n = @ ) , AS-AQ ( n = @ ) or SP-AQ ( n = @ ) and were followed up for @ days .
Method	Clinical outcome was classified according to the standard @ World Health Organization protocol .
Result	At day @ , the cure rates in a per-protocol analysis were @ % ( @/@ ) with AL , @ % ( @/@ ) with AS-SMP , @ % ( @/@ ) with AS-AQ and @ % ( @/@ ) with SP-AQ , with no statistically significant difference between the four treatments .
Result	Defervescence was significantly faster with AS-AQ than with AL ( p < @ ) .
Result	Fatigue was reported significantly more frequently by patients receiving AQ than by those treated with AS-SMP or AL ( p = @ ) .
Result	All the other adverse events reported were mild , and no significant difference was noted by treatment .
Conclusion	The three artemisinin-bsed combinations show similar , satisfactory results , comparable to that with SP-AQ .
Conclusion	This evaluation is the first conducted in CAR since the official introduction of ACT .
Conclusion	It should guide the National Malaria Control Programme in choosing the appropriate ACT for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the future .

Background	Because of its contribution to dietary diversity and to favorable intakes of micronutrients , including iron and zinc , meat is hypothesized to be a valuable complementary food for the infant and young child .
Background	However , the evidence base remains limited .
Problem	To compare the difference in anthropometric measurements of rural Chinese infants and toddlers @ to @ months of age who received a daily supplement of meat or cereal for @ months .
Method	This cluster-randomized , controlled study provided a daily supplement of either meat ( n = @ , @ clusters ) or cereal ( n = @ , @ clusters ) starting as a first complementary food at @ months of age .
Method	Anthropometric measurements were assessed longitudinally .
Result	After @ months of intervention , the meat group ( @ @ cm ) had greater ( p = @ ) linear growth than the cereal group ( @ @ cm ) and a smaller decrease in length-for-age z-score ( LAZ ) over time ( -@ @ in the meat group vs. -@ @ in the cereal group ) , after adjustment for baseline length , LAZ , maternal education , work status , and maternal height and weight .
Conclusion	Linear growth was modestly greater in the meat group than in the cereal group .
Conclusion	LAZ was substantially negative at @ months , and the intervention did not prevent ongoing decline over the course of the study .

Problem	A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) has recently been suggested .
Problem	Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients .
Method	The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin ( PRM ) ( @ mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in @ patients ( men -LSB- @ % -RSB- , women -LSB- @ % -RSB- , average age @ years -LSB- range , @-@ years -RSB- ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) .
Method	In this randomized , double-blind , parallel-group study , patients were treated for @ weeks with placebo and then randomized ( @:@ ) to receive @ mg of PRM or placebo nightly for @ weeks , followed by @ weeks placebo .
Method	The AD Assessment Scale-Cognition ( ADAS-Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured .
Result	Patients treated with PRM ( @ weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P = @ ) and MMSE ( P = @ ) .
Result	Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups .
Result	Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component @ , was also better with PRM ( P = @ ) .
Result	In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI @ ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P = @ ) , MMSE score ( +@ versus -@ points ) ( P = @ ) , and sleep efficiency ( P = @ ) .
Result	Median ADAS-Cog values ( -@ versus +@ points ) ( P = @ ) were significantly better with PRM .
Result	Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration .
Result	PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo .
Conclusion	Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .
Conclusion	The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline .

Problem	We hypothesized that arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs using leukocyte - and platelet-rich fibrin ( L-PRF ) in a standardized , modified protocol is technically feasible and results in a higher vascularization response and watertight healing rate during early healing .
Method	Twenty patients with chronic rotator cuff tears were randomly assigned to @ treatment groups .
Method	In the test group ( N = @ ) , L-PRF was added in between the tendon and the bone during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair .
Method	The second group served as control ( N = @ ) .
Method	They received the same arthroscopic treatment without the use of L-PRF .
Method	We used a double-row tension band technique .
Method	Clinical examinations including subjective shoulder value , visual analog scale , Constant , and Simple Shoulder Test scores and measurement of the vascularization with power Doppler ultrasonography were made at @ and @ weeks .
Result	There have been no postoperative complications .
Result	At @ and @ weeks , there was no significant difference in the clinical scores between the test and the control groups .
Result	The mean vascularization index of the surgical tendon-to-bone insertions was always significantly higher in the L-PRF group than in the contralateral healthy shoulders at @ and @ weeks ( P = @ ) .
Result	Whereas the L-PRF group showed a higher vascularization compared with the control group at @ weeks ( P = @ ) , there was no difference after @ weeks of follow-up ( P = @ ) .
Result	Watertight healing was obtained in @ % of the repaired cuffs .
Conclusion	Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with the application of L-PRF is technically feasible and yields higher early vascularization .
Conclusion	Increased vascularization may potentially predispose to an increased and earlier cellular response and an increased healing rate .

Problem	This study delineates activities of daily living ( ADL ) and instrumental activities of daily living ( IADL ) black-white disparity trends by age , period , and cohort ( APC ) and explores sociodemographic contributors of cohort-based disparity trends .
Method	We utilized multiple cross-sectional waves of National Health Interview Survey data ( @-@ ) to describe APC trends of ADL and IADL disparities using a cross-classified random effect model .
Method	Further , we decomposed the cohort-based disparity trends using Fairlie 's decomposition method for nonlinear outcomes .
Result	The crossover ADL and IADL disparities ( whites > blacks ) occurring at age @ increased with age and reached a plateau at age of @ , whereas period-based ADL and IADL disparities remained constant for the past @ decades .
Result	The cohort disparity trends for both disabilities showed a decline with each successive cohort except for ADL disparity among women .
Conclusion	We examined the role of aging on racial disparity in disability and found support for the racial crossover effect .
Conclusion	Further , the racial disparity in disability will disappear should the observed pattern of declining cohort-based ADL and IADL disparities persist .
Conclusion	Although education , income , and marital status are important sociodemographic contributors to cohort disparity trends , future studies should investigate individual behavioral health determinants and cohort-specific characteristics that explain the cohort-based racial difference in ADL and IADL disabilities .

Background	The interferon-free combination of the protease inhibitor ABT-@ with ritonavir ( ABT-@ / r ) and the NS@A inhibitor ombitasvir ( also known as ABT-@ ) plus the nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir ( also known as ABT-@ ) and ribavirin has shown efficacy against the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) in patients with HCV genotype @ infection .
Background	In this phase @ trial , we evaluated this regimen in previously untreated patients with HCV genotype @ infection and no cirrhosis .
Method	In this multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , we assigned previously untreated patients with HCV genotype @ infection , in a @:@ ratio , to an active regimen consisting of a single-tablet coformulation of ABT-@ / r-ombitasvir ( at a once-daily dose of @ mg of ABT-@ , @ mg of ritonavir , and @ mg of ombitasvir ) , and dasabuvir ( @ mg twice daily ) with ribavirin ( in doses determined according to body weight ) ( group A ) or matching placebos ( group B ) .
Method	The patients received the study treatment during a @-week double-blind period .
Method	The primary end point was sustained virologic response at @ weeks after the end of treatment .
Method	The primary analysis compared the response rate in group A with the response rate ( @ % ) in a historical control group of previously untreated patients without cirrhosis who received telaprevir with peginterferon and ribavirin .
Method	Adverse events occurring during the double-blind period were compared between group A and group B.
Result	A total of @ patients received at least one dose of the study drugs .
Result	The rate of sustained virologic response in group A was @ % ( @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ) , which was superior to the historical control rate .
Result	Virologic failure during treatment and relapse after treatment occurred in @ % and @ % , respectively , of the patients in group A.
Result	The response rates in group A were @ % among patients with HCV genotype @a infection and @ % among those with HCV genotype @b infection .
Result	The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was @ % in each study group .
Result	Nausea , pruritus , insomnia , diarrhea , and asthenia occurred in significantly more patients in group A than in group B ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	Reductions in the hemoglobin level were all of grade @ or @ ; reductions of grade @ and @ occurred in @ % and @ % , respectively , of the patients in group A , whereas grade @ reductions occurred in @ % of the patients in group B.
Conclusion	In previously untreated patients with HCV genotype @ infection and no cirrhosis , a @-week multitargeted regimen of ABT-@ / r-ombitasvir and dasabuvir with ribavirin was highly effective and was associated with a low rate of treatment discontinuation .
Conclusion	( Funded by AbbVie ; SAPPHIRE-I ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	Previously published research that examined the effects of high egg consumption in people with type @ diabetes ( T@D ) produced conflicting results leading to recommendations to limit egg intake .
Background	However , people with T@D may benefit from egg consumption because eggs are a nutritious and convenient way of improving protein and micronutrient contents of the diet , which have importance for satiety and weight management .
Problem	In this randomized controlled study , we aimed to determine whether a high-egg diet ( @ eggs/d for @ d/wk ) compared with a low-egg diet ( < @ eggs/wk ) affected circulating lipid profiles , in particular high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , in overweight or obese people with prediabetes or T@D .
Method	A total of @ participants were randomly assigned to one of the @ diets as part of a @-mo weight maintenance study .
Method	Participants attended the clinic monthly and were instructed on the specific types of foods and quantities to be consumed .
Result	There was no significant difference in the change in HDL cholesterol from screening to @ mo between groups ; the mean difference ( @ % CI ) between high - and low-egg groups was +@ mmol/L ( -@ , @ mmol/L ; P = @ ) .
Result	No between-group differences were shown for total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , or glycemic control .
Result	Both groups were matched for protein intake , but the high-egg group reported less hunger and greater satiety postbreakfast .
Result	Polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) and monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) intakes significantly increased from baseline in both groups .
Conclusion	High egg consumption did not have an adverse effect on the lipid profile of people with T@D in the context of increased MUFA and PUFA consumption .
Conclusion	This study suggests that a high-egg diet can be included safely as part of the dietary management of T@D , and it may provide greater satiety .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( http://www.anzctr.org.au/ ) as ACTRN@ .

Method	Reply-paid cards with telephone follow-up were used to invite older people .
Method	GP and practice characteristics were examined in relationship to recruitment rate .
Result	During @-@ , @ of @ GPs ( @ % ) in @ of @ practices approached ( @ % ) were recruited .
Result	Regional variation was marked and @ of @ invited ( @ % ) older people were recruited .
Result	The GP 's length of time at the practice and training in New Zealand was associated with recruitment success .
Conclusion	Despite variability in practice recruitment , a reasonably large and representative sample of older people was recruited through general practices .

Background	Surgery remains the dominant treatment for large-bowel obstruction , with emerging data on self-expanding metallic stents .
Problem	The aim of this study was to assess whether stent insertion improves quality of life and survival in comparison with surgical decompression .
Method	This study reports on a randomized control trial ( registry number ACTRN@ ) .
Method	This study was conducted at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital , Sydney , and Western Hospital , Melbourne .
Method	Patients with malignant incurable large-bowel obstruction were randomly assigned to surgical decompression or stent insertion .
Method	The primary end point was differences in EuroQOL EQ-@D quality of life .
Method	Secondary end points included overall survival , @-day mortality , stoma rates , postoperative recovery , complications , and readmissions .
Result	Fifty-two patients of @ needed to reach the calculated sample size were evaluated .
Result	Stent insertion was successful in @ of @ ( @ % ) patients .
Result	The remaining @ patients required a stoma compared with @ of @ ( @ % ) surgery group patients ( p < @ ) .
Result	There were no stent-related perforations or deaths .
Result	The surgery group had significantly reduced quality of life compared with the stent group from baseline to @ and @ weeks ( p = @ and p = @ ) , and from baseline to @ months ( p = @ ) in favor of the stent group , whereas both reported reduced quality of life .
Result	The stent group had an @ % @-day mortality compared with @ % for the surgery group ( p = @ ) .
Result	Median survival was @ and @ months for the groups ( p = @ ) .
Result	The stent group had significantly reduced procedure time ( p = @ ) , postprocedure stay ( p = @ ) , days nothing by mouth ( p = @ ) , and days before free access to solids ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This study was limited by the lack of an EQ-@D Australian-based population set .
Conclusion	Stent use in patients with incurable large-bowel obstruction has a number of advantages with faster return to diet , decreased stoma rates , reduced postprocedure stay , and some quality-of-life benefits .

Problem	This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral fixed-dose combination of strontium ranelate @ g/vitamin D @ IU daily vs strontium ranelate @ g daily for correcting vitamin D insufficiency in osteoporosis .
Method	A @-month international , randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , phase @ study .
Method	A total of @ men and postmenopausal women aged @ years with primary osteoporosis ( T-score -@ s.d. ) and serum @-hydroxyvitamin D ( @ ( OH ) D ) > @ nmol/l were included .
Method	Patients were allocated to strontium ranelate @ g/vitamin D @ IU daily ( n = @ ) or strontium ranelate @ g daily ( n = @ ) .
Method	The participants received calcium @ g daily .
Method	The primary endpoint was serum @ ( OH ) D at last post-baseline evaluation during @ months .
Result	Both groups were comparable at baseline .
Result	Mean baseline of @ ( OH ) D was @ @ nmol/l .

Result	The efficacy of the fixed-dose combination on @ ( OH ) D was maintained at @ months ( @ vs @ % , P < @ ) .
Result	Mean @ ( OH ) D was @ and @ nmol/l , respectively , after @ months and @ and @ nmol/l after @ months .
Result	Physical performance improved in both groups .
Result	Falls were @ and @ % in the strontium ranelate/vitamin D and strontium ranelate groups respectively .
Result	Parathyroid hormone levels were inversely correlated with @ ( OH ) D. No clinically relevant differences in safety were observed .
Conclusion	This study confirms the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination of strontium ranelate @ g/vitamin D @ IU for correction of vitamin D insufficiency in osteoporotic patients .

Background	During perioperative fasting , lipid metabolism gradually increases , resulting in free fatty acids ( FFA ) and/or ketone bodies .
Background	Suppression of surgical stress by remifentanil may allow the safe administration of glucose infusions , avoiding both hyperglycemia and ketogenesis .
Background	The effects of glucose infusion on glucose and lipid metabolism were therefore investigated in patients undergoing minor surgery with remifentanil anesthesia .
Method	Thirty-four patients were randomized @:@ to receive no glucose ( @G group ) or low-dose glucose ( @ g/kg/h for @h followed by @ g/kg/h for @h ; LG group ) .
Method	The concentrations of glucose , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , @-methylhistidine ( @-MH ) , insulin , cortisol , FFA , creatinine ( Cr ) , and ketone bodies were measured before anesthetic induction , @ and @h after glucose infusion , at the end of surgery , and the next morning .
Result	The concentrations of cortisol and ACTH decreased during surgery in both groups when compared with the concentrations before anesthesia and at the end of surgery ( P < @ ) .
Result	Glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the LG than in the @G group at @ and @h after infusion .
Result	No patient experienced hyperglycemia .
Result	The concentrations of FFA and ketone bodies were lower in the LG than in the @G group during surgery , but there were no significant between group differences in @-MH/Cr .
Conclusion	Infusion of low-dose glucose attenuated fat catabolism without causing hyperglycemia , indicating that infusion of low-dose glucose during remifentanil-induced anesthesia may be safe for patients .

Problem	Aspirin early after intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke increases the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( SICH ) , without influencing functional outcome at @ months .
Problem	The effect of aspirin on early neurological deterioration ( END ) was explored as a post hoc analysis of the randomized Antiplatelet Therapy in Combination With Recombinant t-PA Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke ( ARTIS ) trial .
Method	END , defined as a @ points National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale worsening @ hours after intravenous thrombolysis , was categorized into SICH ( ENDSICH ) and cerebral ischemia ( ENDCI ) .
Method	Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the effect of aspirin on END .
Result	Of the @ patients , @ patients ( @ % ) experienced END ( @ ENDSICH , @ ENDCI ) .
Result	Aspirin increased the risk of ENDSICH ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) but not of ENDCI ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
Result	After adjustment for other explanatory variables , the association between aspirin and ENDSICH remained significant .
Conclusion	In this trial , there is no evidence of an early antithrombotic effect from the addition of aspirin to intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke .

Background	While overall survival for most common cancers in Australia is improving , the rural-urban differential has been widening , with significant excess deaths due to lung , colorectal , breast and prostate cancer in regional Australia .

Problem	This study investigated the long-term safety of rivastigmine ( @ mg/d capsules , @ mg/@ h patch ) and effects on motor symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Parkinson disease dementia .
Method	This was a @-week , prospective , open-label , randomized study in patients aged @ to @ years .
Method	Primary outcomes included incidence of , and discontinuation due to , predefined adverse events ( AEs ) potentially arising from worsening of Parkinson disease motor symptoms with capsules .
Method	Secondary outcomes included frequency of AEs/serious AEs .
Method	Efficacy outcomes included Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) , Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI-@ ) , and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( MDRS ) .
Result	Five hundred eighty-three patients were randomized to rivastigmine capsules ( n = @ ) or patch ( n = @ ) .
Result	Incidence of predefined AEs was @ % for capsules , @ % for patch ; discontinuation due to worsening of motor symptoms was @ % and @ % , respectively .
Result	Most common AEs were nausea ( capsules , @ % ; patch , @ % ) , tremor ( @ % ; @ % ) , fall ( @ % ; @ % ) , vomiting ( @ % ; @ % ) , and application site erythema ( @ % ; @ % ) .
Result	Significant efficacy in favor of capsules was observed at weeks @ to @ on MDRS ; @ and @ on NPI-@ ; weeks @ and @ on ADCS-ADL .
Result	In patients with Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) greater than @ , no differences in efficacy on MDRS and ADCS-ADL were observed at any time point ; significant differences in favor of capsules were maintained in patients with MMSE less than or equal to @ .
Conclusion	This study supports the long-term safety of rivastigmine in Parkinson disease dementia .
Conclusion	The rate of worsening of motor symptoms was in the range expected due to the natural progression of Parkinson disease , no new or unexpected safety issues emerged in the long-term .

Problem	Emphasizing societal benefits of vaccines has been linked to increased vaccination intentions in adults .
Problem	It is unclear if this pattern holds for parents deciding whether to vaccinate their children .
Problem	The objective was to determine whether emphasizing the benefits of measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccination directly to the vaccine recipient or to society differentially impacts parents ' vaccine intentions for their infants .
Method	In a national online survey , parents ( N = @ ) of infants < @ months old were randomly assigned to receive @ of @ MMR vaccine messages : ( @ ) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement ( VIS ) , ( @ ) VIS and information emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits to the child , ( @ ) VIS and information emphasizing societal benefits , or ( @ ) VIS and information emphasizing benefits both to the child and society .
Method	Parents reported their likelihood of vaccinating their infants for MMR on a response scale of @ ( extremely unlikely ) to @ ( extremely likely ) .
Result	Compared with the VIS-only group ( mean intention = @ ) , parents reported increased vaccine intentions for their infants when receiving additional information emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits either directly to the child ( mean intention = @ , P = @ ) or to both the child and society ( mean intention = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Emphasizing the MMR vaccine 's benefits only to society did not increase intentions ( mean intention = @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	We did not see increases in parents ' MMR vaccine intentions for their infants when societal benefits were emphasized without mention of benefits directly to the child .
Conclusion	This finding suggests that providers should emphasize benefits directly to the child .
Conclusion	Mentioning societal benefits seems to neither add value to , nor interfere with , information highlighting benefits directly to the child .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a @-month course of anti-inflammatory treatment with colchicinein improving functional status of patients with stable chronic heart failure ( CHF ) .
Background	CHF has been shown to be associated with inflammatory activation .
Background	Inflammation has been designated as a therapeutic target in CHF .
Method	Patients with stable CHF were randomly assigned to colchicine ( @ mg twice daily ) or placebo for @ months .
Method	Theprimary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least one-grade improvement in New York HeartAssociation class .
Result	Two hundred sixty-seven patients were available for final evaluation of the primary endpoint : its rate was @ % in the control group and @ % in the colchicine group ( odds ratio : @ ; @ % confidence interval : @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	The rate of the composite of death or hospital stay for heart failure was @ % in the control group , compared with @ % in the colchicine group ( p = @ ) .
Result	The changes in treadmill exercise time with treatment were insignificant and similar in the @ groups ( p = @ ) .
Result	C-reactive protein and interleukin-@ were both significantly reduced in the colchicine group ( -@ mg/l and -@ pg/ml , respectively ; p < @ for both , compared with the control group ) .
Conclusion	According to this prospective , randomized study , anti-inflammatory treatment with colchicine in patients with stable CHF , although effective in reducing inflammation biomarker levels , did not affect in any significant way patient functional status ( in terms of New York Heart Association class and objective treadmill exercise tolerance ) or the likelihood of death or hospital stay for heart failure .

Background	Evidence is often missing on social differentials in effects of nutrition interventions .
Background	We evaluated the adherence to and effect of prenatal food and micronutrient supplementations on mortality before the age of five years in different social groups as defined by maternal schooling .
Method	Data came from the MINIMat study ( Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions , Matlab ) , a randomized trial of prenatal food supplementation ( invitation early , about @ weeks -LSB- E -RSB- , or at usual time , about @ weeks -LSB- U -RSB- of pregnancy ) and @mg or @mg iron with @ gm folic acid , or multiple micronutrients ( Fe@F , Fe@F , MMS ) resulting in six randomization groups , EFe@F , UFe@F , EFe@F , UFe@F , EMMS , and UMMS ( n = @ ) .
Method	Included in analysis after omissions ( fetal loss and out-migration ) were @ women and @ live births of which @ had information on maternal schooling .
Method	The study site was rural Matlab , Bangladesh .
Method	The main stratifying variable was maternal schooling dichotomized as < @years and @years .
Method	We used Cox proportional hazard model for survival analyses .
Result	Overall , women having < @ years of schooling adhered more to food ( @ vs. @ packets , P = @ ) but a little less to micronutrient ( @ vs. @ capsules , P = @ ) supplementation compared to women having more schooling , adjusted for maternal age ( years ) , parity and body mass index ( BMI , kg/m@ ) at week @ pregnancy .
Result	Children of mothers with @years of schooling had lower under-five mortality , but the EMMS supplementation reduced the social difference in mortality risk ( using standard program and schooling < @years as reference ; standard program and schooling @years HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; EMMS and schooling @years HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; EMMS and schooling < @years HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , adjusted for maternal age ( years ) , parity and body mass index ( kg/m@ ) at week @ pregnancy .
Conclusion	The combination of an early invitation to prenatal food supplementation and multiple micronutrient supplementation lowered mortality in children before the age of five years and reduced the gap in child survival chances between social groups .
Conclusion	The pattern of adherence to the supplementations was complex ; women with less education adhered more to food supplementation while those with more education had higher adherence to micronutrients .

Problem	To evaluate the anti-spasticity effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy ( CP ) .
Method	Forty-six children and adolescents with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to either active ( @ mA anodal ) or sham ( placebo ) tDCS over the left primary motor cortex ( Ml ) on five consecutive days .
Method	Both group also received routine physical therapy .
Method	Measures of spasticity and passive range of motion ( PROM ) were administered before treatment , immediately after treatment , and at @ - and @-hours follow-up .
Result	Participants assigned to active tDCS treatment evidenced significantly more pre - to immediately post-treatment reductions in spasticity than participants assigned to the sham ( p = @ , p < O. @l , andp = @ for shoulder wrist , and fingers respectively ) and these improvement in spasticity maintainedfor at least @ hours for wrist joints ( p = @ ) .
Result	There was only one participant in the active tDCS condition developed erythematous rash .
Result	However , all participants tolerated the tDCS well without any serious adverse events .
Conclusion	Anodal tDCS appeared to reduce CP-relatedspasticity ( but not PROM ) in the short term .
Conclusion	Researches examine the long term benefits of this intervention on spasticity are warranted .

Conclusion	The findings from this study confirm that inhaled steroids are not effective in preventing recurrence of viral wheezing .
Conclusion	Moreover , no benefits were found in reducing symptoms of respiratory tract infections .

Background	Probiotic bacteria have been shown to have various effects on the microbiota ; this may also affect appetite and may help promote weight loss and maintenance .
Problem	This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp paracasei L. casei W@ ( L. casei W@ ) on glucagon-like peptide-@ ( GLP-@ ) responses in an isolated pig intestine , in piglets and postprandially in humans .
Problem	Additionally , the effect on subjective appetite , ad libitum energy intake , and glucose and insulin responses in humans was investigated .
Method	Piglets were fed with probiotics for @ weeks and the effect on glucagon encoding gene ( GCG ) was investigated .
Method	An isolated pig intestine was perfused with L. casei W@ and the GLP-@ response was measured .
Method	Twenty-one subjects completed a randomized , controlled , crossover study with three arms .
Method	Each participant completed @ test days testing the effect of low dose ( LD ) ( @ ( @ ) CFU ) , high dose ( HD ) ( @ ( @ ) CFU ) L. casei W@ or placebo capsule .
Method	Subjective appetite was assessed before an ad libitum lunch was served .
Method	GLP-@ , insulin and glucose concentrations were analyzed .
Result	Two weeks of treatment of piglets with L. casei W@ resulted in an increase in GCG expression compared to control animals ( P < @ ) .
Result	L. casei W@ increased the GLP-@ response in the isolated pig intestine .
Result	In humans , L. casei W@ had an overall effect on energy intake ( P = @ ) , but no effects on subjective appetite sensation , overall glucose and insulin response and on GLP-@ release were observed ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	The probiotic bacteria L. casei W@ appears to lower food intake acutely , but the underlying mechanisms are not understood .

Background	Cervical radicular pain is a major cause of disability .
Background	No studies have been published comparing different types of nonsurgical therapy .
Method	A comparative-effectiveness study was performed in @ patients with cervical radicular pain less than @ yr in duration .
Method	Participants received nortriptyline and/or gabapentin plus physical therapies , up to three cervical epidural steroid injections ( ESI ) or combination treatment over @ months .
Method	The primary outcome measure was average arm pain on a @ to @ scale at @ month .
Result	One-month arm pain scores were @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) in the combination group , @ ( CI , @ to @ ) in ESI patients , and @ ( CI , @ to @ ) in individuals treated conservatively ( P = @ ) .
Result	Combination group patients experienced a mean reduction of -@ ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) in average arm pain at @ month versus -@ ( CI , -@ to -@ ) in the conservative group and -@ ( CI , -@ to -@ ) in ESI patients ( P = @ ) .
Result	For neck pain , a mean reduction of -@ ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) was noted in combination patients versus -@ ( CI , -@ to -@ ) in conservative group patients and -@ ( CI , -@ to -@ ) in those who received ESI ; P = @ ) .
Result	Three-month posttreatment , @ % of patients treated with combination therapy experienced a positive outcome versus @ % in the conservative group and @ % in ESI patients ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	For the primary outcome measure , no significant differences were found between treatments , although combination therapy provided better improvement than stand-alone treatment on some measures .
Conclusion	Whereas these results suggest an interdisciplinary approach to neck pain may improve outcomes , confirmatory studies are needed .

Background	Monitoring implementation of the `` test and treat '' case-management policy for malaria is an important component of all malaria control programmes in Africa .
Background	Unfortunately , routine information systems are commonly deficient to provide necessary information .
Background	Using health facility surveys we monitored health systems readiness and malaria case-management practices prior to and following implementation of the @ `` test and treat '' policy in Kenya .
Result	Between @ and @ six national , cross-sectional , health facility surveys were undertaken .
Result	The number of facilities assessed ranged between @ and @ , health workers interviewed between @ and @ and outpatient consultations for febrile patients evaluated between @,@ and @,@ across six surveys .
Result	Comparing baseline and the last survey results , all readiness indicators showed significant ( p < @ ) improvements : availability of parasitological diagnosis ( @ % to @ % ) ; RDT availability ( @ % to @ % ) ; total artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) stock-out ( @ % to @ % ) ; stock-out of one or more AL packs ( @ % to @ % ) ; training coverage ( @ to @ % ) ; guidelines access ( @ to @ % ) and supervision ( @ % to @ % ) .
Result	Testing increased by @ % ( @ % to @ % ; p < @ ) while testing and treatment according to test result increased by @ % ( @ % to @ % ; p < @ ) .
Result	Treatment adherence for test positive patients improved from @ % to @ % ( p = @ ) and for test negative patients from @ % to @ % ( p < @ ) .
Result	Significant testing and treatment improvements were observed in children and adults .
Result	There was no difference in practices with respect to the type and result of malaria test ( RDT vs microscopy ) .
Result	Of eight dosing , dispensing and counseling tasks , improvements were observed for four tasks .
Result	Overall AL use for febrile patients decreased from @ % to @ % ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Major improvements in the implementation of `` test and treat '' policy were observed in Kenya .
Conclusion	Some gaps towards universal targets still remained .
Conclusion	Other countries facing similar needs and challenges may consider health facility surveys to monitor malaria case-management .

Background	The treatment of acne can be difficult , with suboptimal adherence resulting in poor treatment outcomes .
Problem	To determine whether demonstrating to patients how to properly apply a topical acne medication through the use of a sample product will improve adherence .
Method	Subjects with mild to moderate acne were instructed to use adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel once daily for six weeks .
Method	Subjects were randomized into sample or no sample group .
Method	Sample group received a demonstration on how to apply the medication using a product sample .
Method	The primary outcome was median adherence , recorded using electronic monitoring , and secondary outcomes were efficacy measures including the Acne Global Assessment ( AGA ) and lesion counts and the Perceived Medical Condition Self-Management Scale ( PMCSMS ) .
Result	Data from @ patients was collected and analyzed .
Result	Median adherence rates were @ % in the sample group and @ % in the no sample group ( p = @ ) .
Result	The median percent improvement in non-inflammatory lesions were @ % for the sample group and @ % for the no-sample group ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The small size of this pilot study limited the extent of subgroup analyses .
Conclusion	Objective electronic monitoring expanded our previous observations of poor adherence in the treatment of acne .
Conclusion	There is a considerable potential effect size on adherence for the use of samples , supporting the need for future , well powered studies to assess the value of using samples in the treatment of acne and other dermatologic skin diseases .

Problem	The objective of the following study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of suspension laryngoscopy under intubation with propofol and remifentanil alone for vocal fold nodule ( VFN ) excision .
Method	A total of @ patients were equally and randomly assigned to elective VFN excision using suspension laryngoscopy under intubation with propofol and remifentanil alone ( Group A ) or with supplementary cisatracurium ( Group B ) .
Result	Intubation time was significantly longer in Group A than in Group B ( @ @ s vs. @ @ s , P = @ ) .
Result	The two groups showed similar Cormack-Lehane classifications , intubation conditions and ease of suspension laryngoscopy .
Result	Both groups showed favorable cardiopulmonary safety profiles .
Result	Post-anesthesia recovery was significantly more rapid in Group A than in Group B , in terms of times to spontaneous breathing return ( @ @ min vs. @ @ min , P < @ ) , consciousness return ( @ @ min vs. @ @ min , P < @ ) , removal of tracheal intubation ( @ @ min vs. @ @ min , P < @ ) and operating room discharge ( @ @ min vs. @ @ min , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Use of propofol and remifentanil alone provides favorable intubation and anesthesia conditions for suspension laryngoscopic VFN excision and accelerates post-anesthesia recovery .

Problem	Interest in online positive psychology interventions ( OPPIs ) continues to grow .
Problem	The empirical literature has identified design factors ( e.g. , variety and duration of activities ) and moderators ( e.g. , personality traits ) that can influence their effectiveness .
Problem	A randomized controlled trial tested an empirically informed OPPI designed to promote self-efficacy and an optimistic outlook .
Problem	Pessimism was included as a trait moderator .
Method	Participants ( N = @ ) were English-speaking adults interested in becoming happier .
Method	They were randomly assigned to complete either an OPPI cultivating optimism or a control condition writing about daily activities for @ weeks .
Method	Follow-up assessments occurred @ and @ months following the exercise period .
Result	A hierarchical linear model analysis indicated that the optimism intervention increased the pursuit of engagement-related happiness in the short term and reduced dysfunctional attitudes across follow-ups .
Result	Pessimistic individuals had more to gain and reported fewer depressive symptoms at post-test .
Conclusion	These findings support the conclusion that empirically informed online interventions can improve psychological well-being , at least in the short run , and may be particularly helpful when tailored to the needs of the individual .

Problem	Pruritus is common among patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis , and the pathogenesis can be explained by several mechanisms .
Problem	However , there is no definite evidence supporting them , which limits the relative efficacy of any individual treatment option .
Problem	In this paper , we aimed to compare pregabalin with ondansetron in treatment of uraemic pruritus ( UP ) in dialysis patients .
Method	In this @-week prospective , randomized , and double-blind trial , we assessed the efficacy and side effects in UP patients undergoing dialysis .
Method	Patients were randomly assigned to receive @ weeks of @ mg twice-weekly pregabalin or @ mg/day ondansetron or a placebo .
Method	Visits were scheduled at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ weeks after treatment .
Method	The severity of pruritus was evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale and modified Duo 's VAG Scale .
Method	Quality of sleep was evaluated using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index .
Method	The effect of UP on health-related quality of life was assessed using the Chinese version of the @-item short-form ( SF-@ ) general health survey .
Method	Baseline laboratory data and demographic characteristics were recorded from patient charts .
Result	Finally , @ ( @ males , @ females , aged @ years old ) out of the @ patients completed the @-week study .
Result	Of five patients who stopped pregabalin treatment due to side effects , two patients reported an improvement in nausea and vomiting among those receiving ondansetron .
Result	Two patients dropped out for renal transplantation .
Result	The @ patients included @ cases from the pregabalin group , @ from the ondansetron group , and @ from the placebo group .
Result	Over the @ weeks , only pregabalin improved UP significantly .
Result	The severity of pruritus was reduced significantly in the pregabalin group compared with the ondansetron and the placebo groups .
Result	The final pruritus scores were not different between the ondansetron and the placebo groups .
Result	Pruritus absolutely disappeared in two patients following renal transplantation .
Conclusion	Pregabalin is an effective alternative for treatment of uraemic pruritus .
Conclusion	Ondansetron has negligible effect on uremic pruritus and is expensive .
Conclusion	A larger sample size may be needed to demonstrate the effect of ondansetron in uraemic pruritus .

Background	Widespread use of @-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV@ ) in children has led to significant reduction in pneumococcal disease in children and adults .
Background	However , diseases caused by serotypes not included in PCV@ have increased .
Background	A @-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV@ ) containing serotypes in PCV@ and @ additional serotypes ( @ , @ , @ , @A , @F , @A , @F , @F ) was developed and evaluated in toddlers @ to @ months of age .
Method	Ninety toddlers who completed an infant series with PCV@ received a single dose of either aluminum-adjuvanted PCV@ , nonadjuvanted PCV@ , or PCV@ .
Method	Injection-site and systemic adverse events ( AEs ) were collected for @ days postvaccination and serious AEs ( SAEs ) were collected for @ days postvaccination .
Method	Solicited AEs included local ( pain/tenderness , swelling , nodule and redness ) and systemic ( fatigue , arthralgia and myalgia ) AEs .
Method	Serotype-specific immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and opsonophagocytic ( OPA ) responses were measured immediately prior and @ days postvaccination .
Result	Incidences of local and systemic AEs were comparable across vaccine groups .
Result	The majority of reported events , regardless of vaccine received , were transient and of mild to moderate intensity .
Result	No clinically significant differences were observed when comparing duration and severity of AEs .
Result	No vaccine-related SAEs or discontinuations from the study due to AEs were reported .
Result	Pneumococcal IgG concentrations and OPA titers increased postvaccination , with appreciable fold rises for all serotypes .
Result	Antibody levels were comparable between both PCV@ formulations and generally comparable to PCV@ for the shared serotypes .
Conclusion	Both formulations of PCV@ display acceptable safety profiles and induce IgG and OPA responses to all vaccine serotypes .

Background	The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group @-@ clinical trial demonstrated the superiority of standard @-fluorouracil/mitomycin-C over @-fluorouracil/cisplatin in combination with radiation in the treatment of anal squamous cell cancer .
Background	Tumor size ( > @ cm ) and lymph node metastases are associated with disease progression .
Background	There may be key molecular differences ( eg , DNA methylation changes ) in tumors at high risk for progression .
Problem	The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are differences in DNA methylation at individual CpG sites and within genes among locally advanced anal cancers , with large tumor size and/or nodal involvement , compared with those that are less advanced .
Method	This was a case-case study among @ patients defined as high risk ( tumor size > @ cm and/or nodal involvement ; n = @ ) or low risk ( @ cm , node negative ; n = @ ) within the mitomycin-C arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group @-@ trial .
Method	DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation@ Array .
Method	The study was conducted in a tertiary care cancer center in collaboration with a national clinical trials cooperative group .
Method	The patients consisted of @ women and @ men with a median age of @ years ( range , @-@ years ) .
Method	DNA methylation differences at individual CpG sites and within genes between low - and high-risk patients were compared using the Mann-Whitney test ( p < @ ) .
Result	A total of @ CpG loci were differentially methylated ( @ increased and @ decreased ) in high - versus low-risk cases .
Result	Genes harboring differentially methylated CpG sites included known tumor suppressor genes and novel targets .
Conclusion	This study only included patients in the mitomycin-C arm with tumor tissue ; however , this sample was representative of the trial .
Conclusion	This is the first study to apply genome-wide methylation analysis to anal cancer .
Conclusion	Biologically relevant differences in methylated targets were found to discriminate locally advanced from early anal cancer .
Conclusion	Epigenetic events likely play a significant role in the progression of anal cancer and may serve as potential biomarkers .

Problem	Benzodiazepines , other anxiolytics , or sedative hypnotics are prescribed for @ % -@ % of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) patients .
Problem	Prior data and theory suggest that these medications may inhibit response to exposure therapy , one of the most effective PTSD treatments .
Problem	The present post hoc study reanalyzed results from a psychotherapy trial to assess whether benzodiazepine use was associated with reduced response to exposure therapy .
Method	Between August @ and October @ , @ female veterans and soldiers meeting DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to @ weekly @-minute sessions of either prolonged exposure ( n = @ ) or present-centered psychotherapy ( n = @ ) .
Method	Benzodiazepine use ( n = @ ) or non-use ( n = @ ) at intake was not randomly assigned .
Method	Multilevel modeling was used to assess the effects of benzodiazepine status , psychotherapy condition , and their interaction on changes on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist during the treatment and @-month follow-up periods .
Result	Consistent with prior reports from these data , prolonged exposure psychotherapy produced greater reductions per week in PTSD symptoms than did present-centered psychotherapy ( b = -@ , P = @ ) .
Result	Patients prescribed benzodiazepines did not have weaker response to prolonged exposure , but demonstrated poorer posttreatment maintenance of gains from present-centered psychotherapy ( b = -@ , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Prolonged exposure is a sufficiently robust treatment that patients who are taking benzodiazepines can benefit from it .
Conclusion	It is unclear whether benzodiazepine use or other patient factors accounted for benzodiazepine recipients ' poorer maintenance of gains in present-centered psychotherapy .

Problem	To explore the efficacy and safety of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) in thrombolytic therapy of vena caval thromboembolism .
Method	Ninety patients diagnosed of vena caval thromboembolism by ultrasound or angiography of inferior vena cava were randomly assigned into @ groups .
Method	rt-PA and parental anticoagulant were given to the patients in the treatment group while those in the control group received only parental anticoagulation .
Method	D-dimer , fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product were analyzed after @-week treatment .
Method	All subjects were closely monitored for the occurrence of severe complications .
Result	The changes from baseline in the above laboratory parameters in the treatment group were significantly greater than those of the control group ( P < @ ) .
Result	No severe complications occurred in either group .
Conclusion	rt-PA is both safe and effective for the thrombolytic therapy of vena caval thromboembolism .

Background	The effect of oral polio vaccine administered already at birth ( OPV@ ) on child survival was not examined before being recommended in @ .
Background	Observational data suggested that OPV@ was harmful for boys , and trials have shown that neonatal vitamin A supplementation ( NVAS ) at birth may be beneficial for boys .
Background	We set out to test this research question in a randomised trial .
Method	The trial was carried out at the Bandim Health Project , Guinea-Bissau .
Method	We planned to enrol @ low-birth weight ( LBW ) boys in a randomised trial to investigate whether NVAS instead of OPV@ could lower infant mortality for LBW boys .
Method	At birth , the children were randomised to OPV ( usual treatment ) or VAS ( intervention treatment ) and followed for @ months for growth and @ months for survival .
Method	Hazard Ratios ( HR ) for mortality were calculated using Cox regression .
Method	We compared the individual anthropometry measurements to the @ WHO growth reference .
Method	We compared differences in z-scores by linear regression .
Method	Relative risks ( RR ) of being stunted or underweight were calculated in Poisson regression models with robust standard errors .
Result	In the rainy season we detected a cluster of deaths in the VAS group and the trial was halted immediately with @ boys enrolled .
Result	The VAS group had significantly higher mortality than the OPV@ group in the rainy season ( HR : @ ( @ - @ ) ) .
Result	All deaths had had contact with the neonatal nursery ; of seven VAS boys enrolled during one week in September , six died within two months of age , whereas only one died among the six boys receiving OPV ( p = @ ) .
Result	Growth ( weight and arm-circumference ) in the VAS group was significantly worse until age @ months .
Conclusion	VAS at birth instead of OPV was not beneficial for the LBW boys in this study .
Conclusion	With the premature closure of the trial it was not possible to answer the research question .
Conclusion	However , the results of this study call for extra caution when testing the effect of NVAS in the future .

Background	Heavy drinking is common among students at UK universities .
Background	US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking .
Problem	We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students ' intentions to drink responsibly .
Method	@,@ UK university students took part in an online study .
Method	Participants were exposed to one of five message types : a descriptive norm , an injunctive norm , a descriptive and injunctive norm , or one of two control messages .
Method	Message credibility was assessed .
Method	Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking .
Result	Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior , whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly .
Result	Norm messages changed normative perceptions , but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline .
Result	Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data , norm messages were not seen as credible .
Conclusion	In this UK based study , although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits , campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students ' intentions to drink more responsibly .
Conclusion	More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings .

Problem	Tuberculosis ( TB ) is highly prevalent among HIV-infected people , including those receiving combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) , necessitating a well tolerated and efficacious TB vaccine for these populations .
Problem	We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate TB vaccine M@/AS@ in adults with well controlled HIV infection on cART .
Method	A randomized , observer-blind , controlled trial ( NCT@ ) .
Method	HIV-infected adults on cART in Switzerland were randomized @:@:@ to receive two doses , @ month apart , of M@/AS@ , AS@ or @ % physiological saline ( N = @ , N = @ and N = @ , respectively ) and were followed up to @ months postdose @ ( D@ ) .
Method	Individuals with CD@ cell counts below @ cells/l were excluded .
Method	Adverse events ( AEs ) including HIV-specific and laboratory safety parameters were recorded .
Method	Cell-mediated ( ICS ) and humoral ( ELISA ) responses were evaluated before vaccination , @ month after each dose ( D@ , D@ ) and D@ .
Result	Thirty-seven individuals -LSB- interquartile range ( IQR ) CD@ cell counts at screening : @-@ cells/l ; undetectable HIV-@ viremia -RSB- were enrolled ; @ % of individuals reported previous BCG vaccination , @ % tested negative for the QuantiFERON-TB assay .
Result	For M@/AS@ recipients , no vaccine-related serious AEs or cART-regimen adjustments were recorded , and there were no clinically relevant effects on laboratory safety parameters , HIV-@ viral loads or CD@ cell counts .
Result	M@/AS@ was immunogenic , inducing persistent and polyfunctional M@-specific CD@ T-cell responses -LSB- medians @ % ( IQR @-@ @ ) at D@ -RSB- and @ % ( @-@ @ ) at D@ , predominantly CD@LIL-@TNF - , CD@LIL-@ and CD@LIL-@TNF-IFN - -RSB- .
Result	All M@/AS@ vaccines were seropositive for anti-M@ IgG after second vaccination until study end .
Conclusion	M@/AS@ was clinically well tolerated and immunogenic in this population , supporting further clinical evaluation in HIV-infected individuals in TB-endemic settings .

Problem	We wanted to confirm the benefit of mometasone furoate ( MF ) in preventing acute radiation reactions , as shown in a previous study ( Bostrm et al , Radiother Oncol @ ; @:@ -@ ) .
Method	The study was a double-blind comparison of MF with D ( Diprobase ) , administered daily from the start of radiation therapy for @ weeks in patients receiving breast radiation therapy , @ Gy in @-Gy fractions daily over @ weeks .
Method	The primary endpoint was mean modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) score .
Result	Mean RTOG scores were significantly less for MF than for D ( P = @ ) .
Result	Maximum RTOG and mean erythema scores were significantly less for MF than for D ( P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
Result	The Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) score was significantly less for MF than for D at weeks @ and @ when corrected for Hospital Anxiety and Depression ( HAD ) questionnaire scores .
Conclusion	MF cream significantly reduces radiation dermatitis when applied to the breast during and after radiation therapy .
Conclusion	For the first time , we have shown a significantly beneficial effect on quality of life using a validated instrument ( DLQI ) , for a topical steroid cream .
Conclusion	We believe that application of this cream should be the standard of care where radiation dermatitis is expected .

Background	The role of trypanocidal therapy in patients with established Chagas ' cardiomyopathy is unproven .
Method	We conducted a prospective , multicenter , randomized study involving @ patients with Chagas ' cardiomyopathy who received benznidazole or placebo for up to @ days and were followed for a mean of @ years .
Method	The primary outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of any of the components of the composite outcome of death , resuscitated cardiac arrest , sustained ventricular tachycardia , insertion of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , cardiac transplantation , new heart failure , stroke , or other thromboembolic event .
Result	The primary outcome occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) in the benznidazole group and in @ ( @ % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	At baseline , a polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) assay was performed on blood samples obtained from @ patients ; @ % had positive results for Trypanosoma cruzi on PCR .
Result	The rates of conversion to negative PCR results ( PCR conversion ) were @ % in the benznidazole group and @ % in the placebo group at the end of treatment , @ % and @ % , respectively , at @ years , and @ % and @ % , respectively , at @ years or more ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	The effect of treatment on PCR conversion varied according to geographic region : in Brazil , the odds ratio for PCR conversion was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ years and @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ or more years ; in Colombia and El Salvador , the odds ratio was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ years and @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ or more years ; and in Argentina and Bolivia , the odds ratio was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ years and @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ or more years ( P < @ for interaction ) .
Result	However , the rates of PCR conversion did not correspond to effects on clinical outcome ( P = @ for interaction ) .
Conclusion	Trypanocidal therapy with benznidazole in patients with established Chagas ' cardiomyopathy significantly reduced serum parasite detection but did not significantly reduce cardiac clinical deterioration through @ years of follow-up .
Conclusion	( Funded by the Population Health Research Institute and others ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ ; Current Controlled Trials number , ISRCTN@ . )

Background	It remains unknown whether local anaesthetic dose is the only factor influencing continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block effects , or whether concentration , volume , or both exert an influence as well .
Method	Bilateral sciatic catheters were inserted in volunteers ( n = @ ) .
Method	Catheters were randomly assigned to ropivacaine of either @ % ( @ ml h ( -@ ) ) or @ % ( @ ml h ( -@ ) ) for @ h.
Method	The primary endpoint was the tolerance to transcutaneous electrical stimulation within the tibial nerve distribution at hour @ .
Method	Secondary endpoints included current tolerance at other time points and plantar flexion maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( @ h total ) .
Result	At hour @ , tolerance to cutaneous stimulation for limbs receiving @ % ropivacaine was -LSB- mean ( standard deviation ) -RSB- @ ( @ ) vs@ @ ( @ ) mA for limbs receiving @ % -LSB- estimated mean difference @ mA ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ to @ ; P = @ and @ for lower and upper boundaries , respectively -RSB- .
Result	Because the @ % CI fell within the prespecified tolerance @ mA , we conclude that the effect of the two concentration/volume combinations were equivalent .
Result	Similar negative findings were found for the secondary outcomes .
Conclusion	For continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks , we found no evidence that local anaesthetic concentration and volume influence block characteristics , suggesting that local anaesthetic dose ( mass ) is the primary determinant of perineural infusion effects in this anatomic location .
Conclusion	These findings suggest that for ambulatory perineural local anaesthetic infusion-for which there is usually a finite local anaesthetic reservoir-decreasing the basal rate while increasing the local anaesthetic concentration may allow for increased infusion duration without compromising postoperative analgesia .

Background	The present study analyses the relation between smoking status and the parameters used to assess vascular structure and function .
Method	This cross-sectional , multi-centre study involved a random sample of @ participants from the EVIDENT study .
Method	The smoking status , peripheral augmentation index and ankle-brachial index were measured in all participants .
Method	In a small subset of the main population ( @ participants ) , the carotid intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity were also measured .
Result	After controlling for the effect of age , sex and other risk factors , present smokers have higher values of carotid intima-media thickness ( p = @ ) .
Result	Along the same lines , current smokers have higher values of pulse wave velocity and lower mean values of ankle-brachial index but without statistical significance in both cases .
Conclusion	Among the parameters of vascular structure and function analysed , only the IMT shows association with the smoking status , after adjusting for confounders .

Background	Images depicting morbidly obese models -LSB- i.e. body mass index ( BMI ) > @ -RSB- often accompany media articles about the health risks of being overweight ( i.e. BMI @-@ ) .
Background	Little is known about the effect of this mismatch on people 's understanding of risk , and perceptions of message relevance .
Method	In total , @ participants ( @ overweight/obese and @ healthy weight ) were randomly allocated to read a health message about the risk of heart disease posed by being overweight , presented alongside ( i ) a photo of an overweight model , ( ii ) a morbidly obese model or ( iii ) no photo .
Method	Between-group differences in the primary outcomes of message relevance , and the body size perceived to be ` at risk ' , were assessed , and the potential moderating effects of motivation , weight concern and existing risk knowledge explored .
Result	Overweight and obese participants in the exaggerated ( morbidly obese ) image condition interpreted health risks to relate to a larger body size than those who saw no image ( F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	There was no experimental effect on perceived personal relevance ( F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	No significant moderation effects were detected , and there was no effect of study condition in healthy weight participants for either outcome .
Conclusion	The findings suggest that the use of morbidly obese models in messages regarding the health risks of being overweight may undermine the impact of these messages among those who they most aim to reach ; the reader may perceive a reduced risk of being ` only ' overweight , and that a higher weight is needed for the negative effects of excess weight to occur .

Background	Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) is a leading cause of diarrhoea in health care settings with symptoms ranging from mild and self-limiting to life threatening .
Background	SMT@ is a novel , non-absorbable antibiotic currently under development for the treatment of CDI .
Background	Here we report the results from a Phase I study .
Method	A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study assessing safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of SMT@ in healthy volunteers .
Method	Pharmacokinetic assessments included blood and faecal sampling .
Method	The effect of food on systemic exposure and analysis of the gut microbiota were also included .
Result	Fifty-six healthy male subjects were enrolled .
Result	Following single oral doses of up to @,@ mg in the fasted state , plasma concentrations of SMT@ were generally below the lower limit of quantification .
Result	In the fed state levels ranged from @ to @ ng/mL after single dosing and after repeat dosing at Day @ from @ to @ ng/mL .
Result	Following single and multiple oral doses of SMT@ , mean daily faecal concentrations increased with increasing dose level and were significantly above the typical MIC range for C. difficile ( @-@ @ g/mL ) .
Result	At @ mg BID , mean ( SD ) faecal concentrations of @,@ ( @ ) g/g and @,@ ( @ ) g/g were determined on days @ and @ of dosing respectively .
Result	No notable metabolites were detected in faeces .
Result	Overall , all doses of SMT@ were well tolerated both as single oral doses or BID oral doses for @ days .
Result	The majority ( @ % ) of adverse events ( AEs ) were classified as gastrointestinal disorders and were mild in severity , resolving without treatment .
Result	The gut microbiota was analysed in the multiple dose groups with minimal changes observed in the bacterial groups analysed except for total clostridia which were reduced to below the limit of detection by day @ of dosing .
Conclusion	Oral administration of SMT@ was considered safe and well tolerated and was associated with negligible plasma concentrations after single and multiple doses .
Conclusion	In addition , minimal disruption of normal gut microbiota was noted , confirming the highly selective spectrum of the compound .
Conclusion	These results support the further clinical development of SMT@ as an oral therapy for CDI .

Problem	Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) occurs in as high as @ % of patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy agents .
Problem	The FDA has yet to approve a therapy for CIPN .
Problem	The aim of this multicenter , phase III , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of @ % ketamine plus @ % amitriptyline ( KA ) cream for reducing CIPN .
Method	Cancer survivors who completed chemotherapy at least @ month prior and had CIPN ( > @ out of @ ) were enrolled ( N = @ ) .
Method	CIPN was assessed using average scores from a @-day daily diary that asks patients to rate the average `` pain , numbness , or tingling in -LSB- their -RSB- hands and feet over the past @ h '' on an @-point numeric rating scale at baseline and @ weeks post intervention .
Method	ANCOVA was used to measure differences in @-week CIPN with effects including baseline CIPN , KA treatment arm , and previous taxane therapy ( Y/N ) .
Result	The KA treatment showed no effect on @-week CIPN scores ( adjusted mean difference = -@ , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This study suggests that KA cream does not decrease CIPN symptoms in cancer survivors .

Background	Patients with Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease are frequently administered a combination of clarithromycin , ethambutol , and rifampicin .
Background	However , rifampicin is known to reduce the serum levels of clarithromycin .
Background	It remains unclear whether a reduction in clarithromycin serum levels influences the clinical outcome of the Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease treatment regimen .
Problem	To compare a three-drug regimen ( clarithromycin , ethambutol , and rifampicin ) to a two-drug regimen ( clarithromycin and ethambutol ) for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium lung disease .
Method	In a preliminary open-label study , we randomly assigned newly diagnosed , but as-yet untreated , patients with disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex without HIV infection to either the three-drug or the two-drug regimen for @ months .
Method	The primary endpoint was the conversion of sputum cultures to negative after @ months of treatment .
Method	Patient data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat method .
Result	Of @ eligible patients , @ were assigned to the three-drug regimen and @ to the two-drug regimen .
Result	The rate of sputum culture conversion was @ % with the three-drug regimen and @ % with the two-drug regimen ( difference , -@ % -LSB- @ % confidence interval , -@ to @ -RSB- ) .
Result	The incidence of adverse events leading to the discontinuation of treatment was @ and @ % for the three-drug and the two-drug regimens , respectively .
Conclusion	This preliminary study suggests that treatment with clarithromycin and ethambutol is not inferior to treatment with clarithromycin , ethambutol , and rifampicin for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease .
Conclusion	Our findings justify a larger clinical trial to compare long-term clinical outcomes for the two treatment regimens .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registered with http://www.umin.ac.jp/english/ ( UMIN@ ) .

Background	Evidence supports that adequate treatment of hyperglycemia , hypercholesterolemia , and hypertension can reduce morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes , however achieving treatment goals remains elusive .
Background	The majority of diabetes care occurs in the primary care setting ; however there are often missed opportunities for timely intervention during office visits .
Background	This paper describes a systematic redesign of current diabetes treatment in primary care by implementing evidence-based protocols .
Method	This is a cluster randomized controlled trial using certified diabetes educators ( CDEs ) to intensify therapeutic management .
Method	Fifteen primary care practices from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were recruited .
Method	Practices were randomized to intervention ( implementation of diabetes management protocols ) or usual care .
Method	Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of type @ diabetes at least one year prior to baseline and an A@C @ % , LDLc @ mg/dl or blood pressure @/@ mmHg which were the goal levels established by the American Diabetes Association at study inception .
Method	Treatment was intensified according to preapproved protocols .
Method	Participants also received diabetes education during their visits .
Method	Research assessments were done at baseline , three , six and twelve months .
Method	Clinical visits were scheduled between research visits , as needed , to adjust medications .
Method	Primary outcomes were achievement of glycemic , blood pressure , or lipid control goals .
Method	Secondary outcomes included quality of life , medication and diabetes care satisfaction , medication adherence , and cost-effectiveness .
Conclusion	Results from this study will provide the evidence to support expanded roles for CDEs in primary care .
Conclusion	Using this model to deliver diabetes care may offer a more cost-effective approach for diabetes management .

Problem	To discuss the drug intervention in diversity changes of TCRVbeta gene in AIDS patients with incomplete immune reconstitution .
Method	PBMCs were isolated from @ cases of AIDS patients failure to immune reconstitution before and after treatment with immune @ and @ cases of HIV negative healthy donors .
Method	The human gene TCRVbeta CDR@ diversity quantitative detection reagent box were used , and mapped the distribution of gene scanning and calculated different CDR@ fragme of each Vbeta family size .
Result	Compared with the normal group , there appeared some single or oligoclonal amplification of Vbeta CDR@ region in the patients , which were improved or recovered after treatment .
Result	Among them , D value of four families ( @ , @ , @ , @ ) decreased after treatment in both groups .
Result	The decrease in family @ and @ was significant ( P < @ ) in treatment group compared with the control group .
Result	And family @ was decreased in treatment group and increased significantly in control group ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Study of the mechanism showed oligoclonal of TCRVbeta family can get recovery in some degrees after treated by Immune @ plus HAART , suggesting that the medicine may promote T-cell receptor gene rearrangement , helping immune cells to effectively identify the virus to reduce T-cell apoptosis .

Background	CBP@ , a synthetic duodecapeptide , increases cisplatin influx into tumor cells through an interaction with calmodulin enhancing cisplatin cytotoxicity , and effects cell cycle progression by abrogating DNA repair at the G@ checkpoint .
Background	In phase I clinical trials of CBP@ alone or in combination with cisplatin , the most common toxicity was infusion-related urticaria .
Background	Activity of CBP@ plus cisplatin was observed in patients with ovarian cancer and mesothelioma , including some patients previously treated with cisplatin .
Method	Chemotherapy nave patients with unresectable MPM were stratified by histology and performance status , and randomized @:@ to pemetrexed/cisplatin plus CBP@ @mg/m ( @ ) IV ( Arm A ) or pemetrexed/cisplatin alone ( Arm B ) .
Method	The primary endpoint was progression free survival ( PFS ) at @ months .
Result	@ patients were randomized , and @ were treated .
Result	Patient characteristics in the two arms were balanced .
Result	Based on independent radiology review of the treated population , @/@ patients ( @ % ) in Arm A and @/@ ( @ % ) in Arm B had PFS@mo ; the median PFS was @ mo ( @ % CI , @ , @ ) vs @ mo ( @ , @ ) .
Result	Median OS was @ mo ( @ , @ ) in Arm A and @ ( @ , @ ) in Arm B. Adverse events were not different than expected from standard chemotherapy , and comparable in the two arms , aside from infusion reactions which occurred in @ % of patients treated with CBP@ .
Conclusion	While this randomized phase II trial met its primary endpoint of PFS at @ months , other parameters such as response rate and overall survival suggest that the addition of CBP@ does not improve the efficacy of standard chemotherapy for MPM .

Problem	The Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes ( SCOUT ) trial showed a significantly increased relative risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events , but not mortality , in overweight and obese subjects receiving long-term sibutramine treatment with diet and exercise .
Problem	We examined the relationship between early changes ( both increases and decreases ) in body weight and blood pressure , and the impact of these changes on subsequent cardiovascular outcome events .
Method	A total of @ male and female subjects , aged @ years or older , with a body mass index of @-@kgm ( -@ ) were included in this current subanalysis of the SCOUT trial .
Method	Subjects were required to have a history of cardiovascular disease and/or type @ diabetes mellitus with at least one cardiovascular risk factor ( hypertension , dyslipidemia , current smoking or diabetic nephropathy ) to assess cardiovascular outcomes .
Method	Post hoc subgroup analyses of weight change ( categories ) and blood pressure were performed overall and by treatment group ( @-week sibutramine followed by randomized placebo or continued sibutramine ) .
Method	The primary outcome event ( POE ) was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death .
Method	Time-to-event analyses of the POE were performed using Cox regression models with factors for treatment , subgroups and interactions .
Result	During the initial @-week sibutramine treatment period , systolic blood pressure decreased progressively with increasing weight loss in hypertensive subjects ( -@ mmHg with < @kg weight loss to -@ mmHg with @kg weight loss ) .
Result	The highest POE incidence occurred mainly in groups with increases in both weight and blood pressure .
Result	However , with long-term sibutramine treatment , a markedly lower blood pressure tended to increase POEs .
Conclusion	Modest weight loss and modest lower blood pressure each reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events , as expected .
Conclusion	However , the combination of early marked weight loss and rapid blood pressure reduction seems to be harmful in this obese elderly cardiovascular diseased population .

Background	Current studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of laser intervention in the treatment of onychomycosis .
Background	The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of long-pulsed Nd : YAG @ nm laser for treatment of toenails onychomycosis with fingernails onychomycosis .
Method	One hundred and twelve affected fingernails or toenails in @ patients with onychomycosis were randomized into Group @ ( @ patients with @ affected fingernails ) and Group @ ( @ patients with @ affected toenails ) .
Method	These patients were further classified into three subgroups ( Grade II , III , and IV ) according to Scoring Clinical Index of Onychomycosis .
Method	All the affected nails were treated with long-pulse Nd : YAG @ nm laser intervention , once weekly , for continuous weeks , and were followed up for @ weeks .
Result	The response rates at weeks @ , @ , and @ were @ , @ and @ % , respectively , for Group @ , and @ , @ and @ % for Group @ .
Result	The inter-group difference in efficacy was statistically significant ( P < @ ) .
Result	Even in the same subgroup , the response rate of Group @ was higher than that of Group @ .
Conclusion	The efficacy of long-pulsed Nd : YAG @ nm laser intervention against affected toenails is superior to that against fingernails .
Conclusion	It is also effective for treatment of onychomycosis with different severity .

Problem	This study reports @-month follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial of preschool-based social communication treatment for young children with autism .
Method	A total of @ children ( @ males ) with autism , @ to @ months of age , had earlier been randomized either to @ weeks of preschool-based social communication treatment in addition to standard preschool program ( n = @ ) or to standard preschool program only ( n = @ ) .
Method	Significant short-term effects on targeted social communication skills have previously been published .
Method	Long-term gains in social communication , language and global social functioning and communication were assessed from video-taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child interactions , Early Social Communication Scales , Reynell Developmental Language Scale , and Social Communication Questionnaire .
Result	Compared with those in the control group , the treated children achieved significantly larger improvements in joint attention and joint engagement from baseline to @-month follow-up .
Result	However , no effects were detected on language and global ratings of social functioning and communication .
Result	The treatment effect on child initiation of joint attention increased with increasing level of sociability at baseline , whereas nonverbal IQ and expressive language had no moderating effect .
Conclusion	This study is the first to show that , similar to specialist-delivered treatment , preschool-based treatment may produce small but possibly clinically important long-term changes in social communication in young children with autism .
Conclusion	The treatment did not affect language and global ratings of social functioning and communication .
Conclusion	More studies are needed to better understand whether treatment effects may be improved by increasing the intensity and duration of the treatment .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registration information -- Joint Attention Intervention and Young Children With Autism ; http://clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT@ .

Background	Youths with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders ( FH + ) are at a greater risk of developing substance use disorders than their peers with no such family histories ( FH - ) , and this increased risk may be related to impaired maturation of forebrain circuitry .
Background	FH + individuals have shown altered forebrain activity at rest and while performing cognitive tasks .
Background	However , it is not fully understood how forebrain activity is altered in FH + individuals , and ultimately how these alterations may contribute to substance use disorder risk .
Method	In this study , we tested @ FH + and @ FH - youths performing a go/no-go task and examined activations in blocks with only go trials ( Go Only ) , blocks with @ % go and @ % no-go trials ( Go/NoGo ) , and a contrast of those @ blocks .
Result	FH + youths had significantly greater cerebral activations in both the Go and Go/NoGo blocks than FH - youths in regions including the posterior cingulate/precuneus , bilateral middle/superior temporal gyrus , and medial superior frontal gyrus with no significant group differences in the subtraction between Go Only and Go/NoGo blocks .
Result	Additionally , FH + youths had moderately slower reaction times on go trials in the Go Only blocks .
Conclusion	Our findings suggest that global activation increase in FH + youths are modulated by FH density and are not specific to the inhibitory components of the task .
Conclusion	This pattern of increased activations in FH + youths may be at least partially due to impaired forebrain white matter development leading to greater activations/less efficient neural communication during task performance .

Problem	To analyze changes in refraction and associated biometric changes in atropine - and placebo-treated eyes in the Atropine for Treatment of Myopia study ( ATOM@ ) .
Method	A total of @ myopic children , aged @ to @ years , were assigned randomly to receive @ % atropine or a placebo agent in one eye daily for @ years , after which drops were stopped and children monitored for another year .
Method	Cycloplegic autorefraction , A-scan biometry , and automated keratometry were performed at the initial visit , @ weeks ( baseline ) , and at @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ months .
Result	A total of @ children ( @ % ) completed the study .
Result	In placebo-treated eyes , there was myopic progression of -@ diopters ( D ) , between baseline and @ months , associated with reductions in corneal curvature ( K ; -@ D ) and anterior chamber depth ( ACD ; -@ mm ) and increases in lens thickness ( LT ; @ mm ) , vitreous chamber depth ( VCD ; @ mm ) , and axial length ( AL ; @ mm ) .
Result	Multivariate analysis of change in spherical equivalent demonstrated that the hyperopic shift ( @ D ) noted in atropine-treated eyes between baseline and @ months , and the myopic rebound ( -@ D ) noted between @ to @ months when atropine was stopped , were associated with a reduction and increase in VCD and AL , respectively , after adjusting for age and sex .
Result	Changes in K , ACD , and LT were less relevant .
Result	Between @ and @ months , atropine-treated eyes demonstrated gradual myopic progression ( -@ D ) , accompanied by reduction in K ( -@ D ) and ACD ( -@ mm ) and increase in VCD ( @ mm ) and AL ( @ mm ) .
Conclusion	Atropine appeared to slow myopia progression mainly by reducing or slowing the growth in VCD , and thereby AL. ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	However , data on the switching from protease inhibitors ( PI ) to ETR are lacking .
Method	HIV-@-infected patients with suppressed viral load ( VL ) during a PI-containing regimen ( > @ months ) and no previous virological failure were randomized to switch from the PI to ETR ( @ mg/day , dissolved in water ) ( ETR group , n = @ ) or to continue with the same regimen ( control group , n = @ ) .
Method	Percentage of patients with VL @ copies/mL were assessed at week @ , as well as changes in CD@ T-cell counts and metabolic profile .
Result	We included @ patients -LSB- @ % male , @ ( @ ; @ ) years -RSB- .
Result	Two patients receiving ETR ( grade-@ diarrhea and voluntary discontinuation ) and another in the control group ( simplification ) discontinued therapy early .
Result	No patients presented virological failure ( two consecutive VL > @ copies/mL ) ; treatment was successful in @ % of the control group and @ % of the ETR group ( intention-to-treat analysis , missing = failure ) ( p = @ ) .
Result	CD@ + T-cell counts did not significantly vary -LSB- +@ cells/L in the ETR group ( p = @ ) and -@ cells/L in the control group ( p = @ ) -RSB- .
Result	The ETR group showed significant reductions in cholesterol ( p < @ ) , triglycerides ( p = < @ ) , and glycemia ( p = @ ) and higher satisfaction ( @-@ scale ) ( p = @ ) .
Result	Trough plasma concentrations of ETR were similar to observed in studies using ETR twice daily .
Conclusion	Switch from a PI-based regimen to a once-daily combination based on ETR maintained undetectable VL during @ weeks in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients while lipid profile and patient satisfaction improved significantly .

Background	Rifapentine has potent activity in mouse models of tuberculosis chemotherapy but its optimal dose and exposure in humans are unknown .
Problem	We conducted a randomized , partially blinded dose-ranging study to determine tolerability , safety , and antimicrobial activity of daily rifapentine for pulmonary tuberculosis treatment .
Method	Adults with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were assigned rifapentine @ , @ , or @ mg/kg or rifampin @ mg/kg daily for @ weeks ( intensive phase ) , with isoniazid , pyrazinamide , and ethambutol .
Method	The primary tolerability end point was treatment discontinuation .
Method	The primary efficacy end point was negative sputum cultures at completion of intensive phase .
Result	A total of @ participants were enrolled .
Result	At completion of intensive phase , cultures on solid media were negative in @ % of participants in the rifampin group versus @ % ( P = @ ) , @ % ( P = @ ) , and @ % ( P = @ ) in the rifapentine @ , @ , and @ mg/kg groups .
Result	Liquid cultures were negative in @ % ( rifampin group ) versus @ % ( P = @ ) , @ % ( P = @ ) , and @ % ( P = @ ) , respectively .
Result	Compared with the rifampin group , the proportion negative at the end of intensive phase was higher among rifapentine recipients who had high rifapentine areas under the concentration-time curve .
Result	Percentages of participants discontinuing assigned treatment for reasons other than microbiologic ineligibility were similar across groups ( rifampin , @ % ; rifapentine @ , @ , or @ mg/kg , @ , @ , and @ % , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Daily rifapentine was well-tolerated and safe .
Conclusion	High rifapentine exposures were associated with high levels of sputum sterilization at completion of intensive phase .
Conclusion	Further studies are warranted to determine if regimens that deliver high rifapentine exposures can shorten treatment duration to less than @ months .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT @ ) .

Background	The purpose of this study was to evaluate a personalized protocol with diluted contrast material ( CM ) for coronary computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) .
Result	One hundred patients with suspected coronary artery disease underwent retrospective electrocardiogram-gated coronary CTA on a @-slice multidetector-row CT scanner .
Result	In the diluted CM protocol ( n = @ ) , the optimal scan timing and CM dilution rate were determined by the timing bolus scan , with @ % CM dilution ( @ml/s during @s ) being considered suitable to achieve the target arterial attenuation of @ Hounsfield units ( HU ) .
Result	In the body weight ( BW ) - adjusted protocol ( n = @ , @mg iodine/kg ) , only the optimal scan timing was determined by the timing bolus scan .
Result	The injection rate and volume in the timing bolus scan and real scan were identical between the @ protocols .
Result	We compared the means and variations in coronary attenuation between the @ protocols .
Result	Coronary attenuation ( meanSD ) in the diluted CM and BW-adjusted protocols was @ HU and @ HU , respectively .
Result	The diluted CM protocol provided significantly higher coronary attenuation and lower variance than did the BW-adjusted protocol ( P < @ , in each ) .
Conclusion	The diluted CM protocol facilitates more uniform attenuation on coronary CTA in comparison with the BW-adjusted protocol .

Conclusion	It has to be further investigated how interventions which have been proven effective in experimental studies can successfully be adapted to routine care conditions .

Problem	Fibroblast growth factor @ ( FGF@ ) and Klotho are associated with vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients .
Problem	Sevelamer has been shown to reduce progression of vascular calcification .
Problem	This study aimed to determine the long-term effect of sevelamer treatment on serum FGF@ and Klotho levels in chronic haemodialysis ( HD ) patients .
Method	In the post-hoc analysis , we measured serum FGF@ , Klotho and other biochemical factors ( Ca , P , i-PTH , hsCRP , LDL-C ) in @ haemodialysis patients , who completed a @-week , open-Label , controlled randomized parallel-group study .
Method	Twenty-three patients received sevelamer and @ patients received calcium carbonate .
Result	After @-week sevelamer treatment , there were significant changes with lower LDL-C ( from @ to @ mmol/L , P = @ ) , lower FGF@ ( from @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) , P = @ ) and higher s-Klotho levels ( from @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) pg/mL , P = @ ) .
Result	In calcium carbonate group , there were no significant changes of LDL-C and FGF@ , but with a borderline significant increase of s-Klotho level ( from @ ( @ ) to @ ( @ ) pg/mL , P = @ ) .
Result	Multivariate analysis showed that FGF@ decrement was associated with sevelamer treatment ( = -@ , P = @ ) , change of serum phosphate ( = @ , P = @ ) and calcium levels ( = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	The increase of serum Klotho was associated with the decrease of serum phosphate ( = @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Maintenance HD patients had lower serum FGF@ levels , accompanied with significantly increased serum Klotho levels , after @-week sevelamer treatment .
Conclusion	The FGF@ decrement was associated with sevelamer use , the change of serum phosphate and calcium levels .
Conclusion	The serum Klotho increment was proportional to the phosphate-lowering power of the binders .

Problem	To investigate the clinical efficacy of three toothpastes in controlling established gingivitis and plaque over @ months .
Method	@ subjects were enrolled in a single-center , double-blind , parallel group , randomized clinical study .
Method	Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatments : triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice containing @ % triclosan , @ % copolymer and @,@ ppm F as sodium fluoride in a silica base ; herbal/bicarbonate dentifrice containing herbal extract and @,@ ppm F as sodium fluoride in a sodium bicarbonate base ; or fluoride dentifrice containing @ ppm F as sodium fluoride , and @,@ ppm F as sodium monofluorophosphate .
Method	Subjects were instructed to brush their teeth twice daily for @ minute for @ months .
Result	After @ months , subjects assigned to the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride group exhibited statistically significant reductions in gingival index scores and plaque index scores as compared to subjects assigned to the herbal/bicarbonate group by @ % and @ % , respectively .
Result	There were no statistically significant differences in gingival index and plaque index between subjects in the herbal / bicarbonate group and those in the fluoride group .
Result	The triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice was statistically significantly more effective in reducing gingivitis and dental plaque than the herbal/bicarbonate dentifrice , and this difference in efficacy was clinically meaningful .

Problem	To examine the effectiveness of a physiotherapy-specific , web-based e-learning platform , `` RAP-el , '' in best-practice management of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) using a single-blind , randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) and prospective cohort study .
Method	Australian-registered physiotherapists were electronically randomized into intervention and control groups .
Method	The intervention group accessed RAP-eL over @ weeks .
Method	Change in self-reported confidence in knowledge and skills was compared between groups at the end of the RCT using linear regression conditioned for baseline scores by a blinded assessor , using intent-to-treat analysis .
Method	Secondary outcomes included physiotherapists ' satisfaction with RA management and responses to RA-relevant clinical statements and practice-relevant vignettes .
Method	Retention was evaluated in a cohort study @ weeks after the RCT .
Result	Eighty physiotherapists were randomized into the intervention and @ into the control groups .
Result	Fifty-six and @ , respectively , provided baseline data .
Result	Significant between-group differences were observed for change in confidence in knowledge ( mean difference @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- @ , @ ; effect size @ ) and skills ( mean difference @ ; @ % CI @ , @ ; effect size @ ) , with the intervention group performing better .
Result	Satisfaction in ability to manage RA , @ of the @ clinical statements , and responses to vignettes demonstrated significant improvement in the intervention group .
Result	Although @-week scores showed declines in most outcomes , their clinical significance remains uncertain .
Conclusion	RAP-eL can improve self-reported confidence , likely practice behaviors and satisfaction in physiotherapists ' ability to manage people with RA , and improve their clinical knowledge in several areas of best-practice RA management in the short term .

Result	MetS was associated with stronger grip strength ( mean difference ( ) = @ kg , P = @ ) in the overall sample and in participants without diabetes mellitus and with poorer self-rated health ( = @ kg , P < @ ) in the overall sample only .
Result	No significant differences were found in @-m walk time , SPPB score , or disability score between participants with and without MetS , in the overall sample or diabetes mellitus subgroups .
Conclusion	Metabolic dysfunction is highly prevalent in older adults at risk of mobility disability , yet consistent associations were not observed between MetS and walking speed , lower extremity function , or self-reported disability after adjusting for known and potential confounders .
Conclusion	Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether MetS accelerates declines in functional status in high-risk older adults and to inform clinical and public health interventions aimed at preventing or delaying disability in this group .

Problem	Past literature documents many individual predictors of treatment engagement among mental health clients in community settings , but few studies have examined clinic characteristics that may be associated with treatment engagement .
Problem	With data from a patient activation and self-management trial , this study examined the variation in demographic and clinic characteristics across community mental health clinics and whether this variation predicted differences in treatment engagement in mental health services .
Method	Chart reviews were conducted for @ clients of @ community mental health clinics .
Method	Client attendance records were collected for a one-year period to examine engagement ( defined as the ratio of kept versus scheduled appointments ) .
Method	Adjusting for client variability , the investigators examined which clinic-level characteristics were associated with treatment engagement .
Result	Clinics varied significantly in their clients ' demographic characteristics and engagement in mental health care .
Result	Providing case management and offering transportation vouchers or free parking at the clinic were associated with lower engagement .
Result	However , offering outreach was associated with greater engagement .
Conclusion	The results of this study suggest that certain clinic characteristics are associated with engagement in mental health services .
Conclusion	These results demonstrate the difficulties faced by community mental health clinics in reducing no-show rates even in the face of strong efforts to improve engagement .

Problem	To evaluate the effect of @ ) patient values as expressed by family members and @ ) a requirement to document patients ' functional prognosis on intensivists ' intention to discuss withdrawal of life support in a hypothetical family meeting .
Method	A three-armed , randomized trial .
Method	One hundred seventy-nine U.S. hospitals with training programs in critical care accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education .
Method	Six hundred thirty intensivists recruited via e-mail invitation from a database of @,@ eligible academic intensivists .
Method	Each intensivist was randomized to review @ , online , clinical scenarios with a range of illness severities involving a hypothetical patient ( Mrs. X ) .
Method	In control-group scenarios , the patient did not want continued life support without a reasonable chance of independent living .
Method	In the first experimental arm , the patient wanted life support regardless of functional outcome .
Method	In the second experimental arm , patient values were identical to the control group , but intensivists were required to record the patient 's estimated @-month functional prognosis .
Result	Response to the question : `` Would you bring up the possibility of withdrawing life support with Mrs. X 's family ? ''
Result	answered using a five-point Likert scale .
Result	There was no effect of patient values on whether intensivists intended to discuss withdrawal of life support ( p = @ ) , but intensivists randomized to record functional prognosis were @ % more likely ( @ % CI , @-@ % ) to discuss withdrawal .
Conclusion	In this national , scenario-based , randomized trial , patient values had no effect on intensivists ' decisions to discuss withdrawal of life support with family .
Conclusion	However , requiring intensivists to record patients ' estimated @-month functional outcome substantially increased their intention to discuss withdrawal .

Method	The results were analyzed as intention to treat and per protocol .
Method	Possible bias caused by missing data was handled by multiple imputation .
Method	The primary outcome was urinary incontinence ; the secondary outcomes were pelvic organ prolapse , constipation , pain , sexuality , quality of life ( Short Form-@ questionnaire ) , hospital contacts , and vaginal bleeding .
Result	The questionnaire was answered by @ of @ women ( @ % ) ( subtotal hysterectomy -LSB- n = @ -RSB- -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; total hysterectomy -LSB- n = @ -RSB- -LSB- @ % -RSB- ) .
Result	Mean follow-up time was @ years and mean age at follow-up was @ years .
Result	After subtotal abdominal hysterectomy , @ of @ women ( @ % ) complained of urinary incontinence compared with @ of @ women ( @ % ) after total abdominal hysterectomy @ years after hysterectomy ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	After a multiple imputation analysis , this difference disappeared ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	No differences were seen in any of the secondary outcomes .
Conclusion	Subtotal abdominal hysterectomy was not superior to total abdominal hysterectomy on any outcomes .
Conclusion	More women seem to have subjective urinary incontinence @ years after subtotal abdominal hysterectomy .
Conclusion	This result was not confirmed by multiple imputation analysis and should be interpreted cautiously .

Problem	To test the proposed mechanism of action of a task-specific motor learning intervention by examining its effect on measures of the motor control of gait .
Method	Single-blinded randomized clinical trial .
Method	University research laboratory .
Method	Adults ( N = @ ) aged @ years with gait speed > @ m/s and impaired motor skill ( figure-of-@ walk time > @s ) .
Method	The @ interventions included a task-oriented motor learning and a standard exercise program ; both interventions included strength training .
Method	Both lasted @ weeks , with twice-weekly , @-hour , physical therapist-supervised sessions .
Method	Two measures of the motor control of gait , gait variability and smoothness of walking , were assessed pre - and postintervention by assessors masked to the treatment arm .
Result	Of @ randomized subjects , @ completed the trial ( mean age SD , @ y ) .
Result	The motor learning group improved more than the standard group in double-support time variability ( @ m/s vs @ m/s ; adjusted difference -LSB- AD -RSB- = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Smoothness of walking in the anteroposterior direction improved more in the motor learning than standard group for all conditions ( usual : AD = @ , P = @ ; narrow : AD = @ , P = @ ; dual task : AD = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Smoothness of walking in the vertical direction also improved more in the motor learning than standard group for the narrow-path ( AD = @ , P = @ ) and dual-task ( AD = @ , P = @ ) conditions .
Conclusion	Among older adults with subclinical walking difficulty , there is initial evidence that task-oriented motor learning exercise results in gains in the motor control of walking , while standard exercise does not .
Conclusion	Task-oriented motor learning exercise is a promising intervention for improving timing and coordination deficits related to mobility difficulties in older adults , and needs to be evaluated in a definitive larger trial .

Background	The continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) and angiotensin II subtype I receptor antagonists ( ARBs ) medications in the preoperative period has been reported to be associated with intraoperative hypotension that can be unresponsive to pressor drugs .
Background	As a result , several investigators suggested discontinuation of these medications before scheduled surgery but did not report on unintended consequences that might result from discontinuation .
Background	We conducted a prospective , single-blind , randomized trial to observe the effect of the medications on preoperative arterial blood pressure recordings in patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery .
Method	Six hundred forty-four patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery were enrolled prospectively between @ and @ and randomly assigned to @ groups based on continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs .
Method	An intention-to-treat analysis was performed .
Method	The primary outcome was presence of hypertension ( HTN ) immediately before surgery .
Method	Secondary outcomes included surgical cancellations due to HTN , prolongation of hospitalization , adverse clinical events , and HTN in the postoperative period .
Result	Data for @ patients were analyzed .
Result	There were @ patients in the discontinuation group and @ patients in the continuation group .
Result	Discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery was not associated with increased prevalence of preoperative HTN ( P = @ ) .
Result	The upper bound of a @ % confidence interval for the difference in prevalence of Stage @ and @ HTN between study arms indicates that discontinuation of study medication is unlikely to be associated with an increase in Stage @ HTN of > @ percentage points and in Stage @ HTN of no > @ percentage points .
Result	Discontinuation was not associated with an increase in postoperative HTN , with prolongation of hospitalization or with adverse clinical events .
Conclusion	Discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs in patients on the day of surgery did not result in a substantively increased incidence of pre - or postoperative HTN compared with patients who continued these medications on the day of surgery .
Conclusion	The results provide an evidentiary basis for the safety of discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery without increasing adverse hemodynamic outcomes .

Background	The commonly used therapeutic approach , the contemporary Bobath approach ( CBA ) , is not sufficient to restore independent locomotion for individuals with severe motor deficit ( SMD ) after stroke .
Background	Therefore , we propose that the early sitting , standing , and walking in conjunction with the CBA ( ECBA ) be used to treat individuals with SMD after stroke .
Problem	To investigate whether ECBA may enhance mobility and balance in subjects with SMD after stroke .
Method	Thirty-three men and @ women , aged @ to @ years , with SMD after stroke were recruited for the study .
Method	CBA or ECBA was performed with the subjects @ times per week in @-minute sessions for @ weeks .
Method	The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement ( STREAM ) and the Berg Balance Scale were implemented before treatment and at @ and @ weeks after treatment , respectively .
Result	The STREAM scores indicated that ECBA was more efficient than the CBA intervention for lower extremity mobility , F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P < @ , and basic mobility , F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P < @ .
Result	Overall STREAM scores were higher in the ECBA group , F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P < @ , after @ weeks of therapy .
Result	Balance scores of the ECBA subjects were higher than those of the CBA subjects after @ weeks of therapy , F ( @ , @ ) = @ , P < @ .
Result	However , there was no difference in upper extremity mobility between the @ groups .
Conclusion	ECBA is a valuable intervention to improve lower extremity mobility , basic mobility , and balance ability for individuals with SMD after stroke .

Problem	To create a risk model for neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) based on nongenetic factors .

Method	Menstrual duration and number of used pads were recorded by the Pictorial Blood loss Assessment Chart at the end of each menstrual period .
Method	The quality of life was also evaluated using the menorrhagia questionnaire .
Result	The mean number of bleeding days significantly declined from @ days to @ days after @months treatment with the syrup ( p = @ ) and consequently the participants in the intervention group used fewer pads after @months ( @ ) compared with the number of pads used at the beginning of the treatment ( @ , p = @ ) .
Result	Bleeding days and number of pads used by the participants in the placebo group did not change significantly .
Result	Also significant changes of quality of life scores were observed in the intervention group after @months compared to the baseline .
Conclusion	Myrtle syrup is introduced as a potential remedy for abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia .

Problem	The authors compared the efficacy and tolerability of low and moderate dosages of extended-release quetiapine in adults with borderline personality disorder .
Method	Ninety-five participants with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive @ mg/day of quetiapine ( the low-dosage group ; N = @ ) , @ mg/day of quetiapine ( the moderate-dosage group ; N = @ ) , or placebo ( N = @ ) .
Method	Total score over time on the clinician-rated Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder ( `` Zanarini scale '' ) was analyzed in a mixed-effects model accounting for informative dropout .
Result	Participants in the low-dosage quetiapine group had significant improvement on the Zanarini scale compared with those in the placebo group .
Result	Time to response ( defined as a reduction of @ % or more on the Zanarini scale total score ) was significantly shorter for both the low-dosage quetiapine group ( hazard ratio = @ , p = @ ) and the moderate-dosage quetiapine group ( hazard ratio = @ , p = @ ) than for the placebo group .
Result	Among participants who completed the study , @ % in the low-dosage quetiapine group were rated as `` responders , '' compared with @ % in the moderate-dosage group and @ % in the placebo group .
Result	Treatment-emergent adverse events included sedation , change in appetite , and dry mouth .
Result	The overall completion rate for the @-week double-blind treatment phase was @ % ( @ % for the low-dosage quetiapine group , @ % for the moderate-dosage quetiapine group , and @ % for the placebo group ) .
Result	Participants who experienced sedation were more likely to drop out .
Conclusion	Participants treated with @ mg/day of quetiapine had a significant reduction in the severity of borderline personality disorder symptoms compared with those who received placebo .
Conclusion	Adverse events were more likely in participants taking @ mg/day of quetiapine .

Problem	In an attempt to investigate new strategies aimed at reducing inflammation in osteoarthritis , the anti-inflammatory effect of Elaeagnus angustifolia L. as a complementary treatment was evaluated in females with knee osteoarthritis .
Method	In this clinical trial , @ females with mild to moderate osteoarthritis were assigned to two intervention and one placebo groups .
Method	In addition to the conventional therapy , the patients in intervention groups received @g/day of E. angustifolia L. medulla and whole fruit powders respectively for @ weeks .
Method	The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF - ) , interleukine-@ ( IL-@ ) , interleukine-@ ( IL-@ ) , matrix metalloproteinase-@ ( MMP-@ ) and -@ ( MMP-@ ) were measured with human ELISA kits .
Method	Paired t-test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis .
Result	The statistically significant decrease was observed in the mean levels of serum TNF - in the medulla ( @ ) and whole fruit ( @ ) groups after @ weeks of supplementation .
Result	In contrast to the placebo group , there was a significant rise in the mean levels of serum IL-@ in medulla ( p-value = @ ) and whole fruit groups ( p-value = @ ) at the end of study .
Result	The interventions resulted in significant decrease in the mean levels of serum MMP-@ in the medulla ( @ ) and whole fruit ( @ ) groups .
Result	After the interventions , no significant changes were observed in the serum IL-@ and MMP-@ levels .
Conclusion	Daily supplementation with E. angustifolia L. in both forms of medulla and whole fruit powders appeared to be effective for decreasing inflammatory cytokines ( TNF - and MMP-@ ) and enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-@ ) .

Background	Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) is a chronic antigen-driven allergic inflammatory disease , likely involving the interplay of genetic and environmental factors , yet their respective contributions to heritability are unknown .
Problem	To quantify the risk associated with genes and environment on familial clustering of EoE .
Method	Family history was obtained from a hospital-based cohort of @ EoE probands ( n = @ first-degree `` Nuclear-Family '' relatives ) and an international registry of monozygotic and dizygotic twins/triplets ( n = @ EoE `` Twins '' probands ) .
Method	Frequencies , recurrence risk ratios ( RRRs ) , heritability , and twin concordance were estimated .
Method	Environmental exposures were preliminarily examined .
Result	Analysis of the Nuclear-Family-based cohort revealed that the rate of EoE , in first-degree relatives of a proband , was @ % ( unadjusted ) and @ % ( sex-adjusted ) .
Result	RRRs ranged from @ to @ , depending on the family relationship , and were higher in brothers ( @ ; P = @ ) , fathers ( @ ; P = @ ) , and males ( @ ; P < @ ) than in sisters , mothers , and females , respectively .
Result	The risk of EoE for other siblings was @ % .
Result	In the Nuclear-Family cohort , combined gene and common environment heritability was @ % @ % ( P < @ ) .
Result	In the Twins cohort , genetic heritability was @ % @ % ( P < @ ) , and common family environment contributed @ % @ % ( P < @ ) to phenotypic variance .
Result	Probandwise concordance in monozygotic co-twins was @ % @ % compared with @ % @ % in dizygotic co-twins ( P = @ ) .
Result	Greater birth weight difference between twins ( P = @ ) , breast-feeding ( P = @ ) , and fall birth season ( P = @ ) were associated with twin discordance in disease status .
Conclusion	EoE RRRs are increased @ - to @-fold compared with the general population .
Conclusion	EoE in relatives is @ % to @ % , depending on relationship and sex .
Conclusion	Nuclear-Family heritability appeared to be high ( @ % ) .
Conclusion	However , the Twins cohort analysis revealed a powerful role for common environment ( @ % ) compared with additive genetic heritability ( @ % ) .

Background	In North America , few studies have evaluated sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis ( AR/C ) ; pediatric data are sparse .
Background	The authors report findings from the largest published immunotherapy trial yet conducted in adults and children .
Problem	To evaluate grass sublingual immunotherapy tablet ( MK-@ ) treatment in subjects with AR/C .
Method	North American subjects ( @-@ years old ) with grass allergy were randomized @:@ to once-daily MK-@ ( @,@ BAU Phleum pratense ) or placebo .
Method	The first dose was given at the investigator 's office ; subsequent doses were self-administered at home .
Method	The primary end point was total combined score ( TCS ; rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom score -LSB- DSS -RSB- plus daily medication score -LSB- DMS -RSB- ) over the entire grass pollen season ( GPS ) .
Method	Key secondary end points included entire-season DSS , DMS , peak-season TCS , and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire scores .
Method	Safety outcomes included adverse events ( AEs ) .
Result	One thousand five hundred one subjects were randomized ( @ % polysensitized , @ % had asthma ) .
Result	MK-@ yielded improvements vs placebo of @ % in entire-season TCS ( median difference-@ @ , P < @ ) , @ % in peak-season TCS ( median difference-@ @ , P < @ ) , @ % in entire-season DSS ( median difference-@ @ , P = @ ) , @ % in entire-season DMS ( mean difference-@ @ , P < @ ) , and @ % in peak-season rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire ( median difference-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Efficacy between children and adults was similar .
Result	Most AEs were transient local application-site reactions , with no serious treatment-related AEs or anaphylactic shock .
Result	Three subjects ( @ placebo , @ MK-@ ) had moderate systemic allergic reactions .
Conclusion	MK-@ was effective in polysensitized grass-allergic North American children and adults with AR/C in this large trial , confirming previous research .

Background	Although previous studies have suggested the potential advantages of albumin administration in patients with severe sepsis , its efficacy has not been fully established .
Method	In this multicenter , open-label trial , we randomly assigned @ patients with severe sepsis , in @ intensive care units ( ICUs ) , to receive either @ % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone .
Method	In the albumin group , the target serum albumin concentration was @ g per liter or more until discharge from the ICU or @ days after randomization .
Method	The primary outcome was death from any cause at @ days .
Method	Secondary outcomes were death from any cause at @ days , the number of patients with organ dysfunction and the degree of dysfunction , and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital .
Result	During the first @ days , patients in the albumin group , as compared with those in the crystalloid group , had a higher mean arterial pressure ( P = @ ) and lower net fluid balance ( P < @ ) .
Result	The total daily amount of administered fluid did not differ significantly between the two groups ( P = @ ) .
Result	At @ days , @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the albumin group and @ of @ ( @ % ) in the crystalloid group had died ( relative risk in the albumin group , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	At @ days , @ of @ patients ( @ % ) in the albumin group and @ of @ ( @ % ) in the crystalloid group had died ( relative risk , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	No significant differences in other secondary outcomes were observed between the two groups .
Conclusion	In patients with severe sepsis , albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids , as compared with crystalloids alone , did not improve the rate of survival at @ and @ days .
Conclusion	( Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency ; ALBIOS ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Problem	The epilepsy treatment gap is largest in resource-poor countries .
Problem	We evaluated the efficacy of a @-day health education program in a rural area of Kenya .
Problem	The primary outcome was adherence to antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) as measured by drug levels in the blood , and the secondary outcomes were seizure frequency and Kilifi Epilepsy Beliefs and Attitudes Scores ( KEBAS ) .
Method	Seven hundred thirty-eight people with epilepsy ( PWE ) and their designated supporter were randomized to either the intervention ( education ) or nonintervention group .
Method	Data were collected at baseline and @year after the education intervention was administered to the intervention group .
Method	There were @ PWE assessed at both time points .
Method	At the end of the study , @ PWE from the intervention group and @ from the nonintervention group gave blood samples , which were assayed for the most commonly used AEDs ( phenobarbital , phenytoin , and carbamazepine ) .
Method	The proportions of PWE with detectable AED levels were determined using a standard blood assay method .
Method	The laboratory technicians conducting the assays were blinded to the randomization .
Method	Secondary outcomes were evaluated using questionnaires administered by trained field staff .
Method	Modified Poisson regression was used to investigate the factors associated with improved adherence ( transition from nonoptimal AED level in blood at baseline to optimal levels at follow-up ) , reduced seizures , and improved KEBAS , which was done as a post hoc analysis .
Method	This trial is registered in ISRCTN register under ISRCTN@ .
Result	There was no significant difference in adherence to AEDs based on detectable drug levels ( odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- @ , @ % confidence interval -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- @-@ @ , p = @ ) or by self-reports ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) between the intervention and nonintervention group .
Result	The intervention group had significantly fewer beliefs about traditional causes of epilepsy , cultural treatment , and negative stereotypes than the nonintervention group .
Result	There was no difference in seizure frequency .
Result	A comparison of the baseline and follow-up data showed a significant increase in adherence-intervention group ( @-@ % -LSB- p < @ -RSB- ) and nonintervention group ( @-@ % -LSB- p < @ -RSB- ) - using detectable blood levels .
Result	The number of patients with less frequent seizures ( @ seizures in the last @months ) increased in the intervention group ( @-@ % -LSB- p = @ -RSB- ) and in the nonintervention group ( @-@ % -LSB- p = @ -RSB- ) .
Result	Improved therapeutic adherence ( observed in both groups combined ) was positively associated with positive change in beliefs about risks of epilepsy ( relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) and having nontraditional religious beliefs ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	Reduced seizure frequency was associated with improved adherence ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	Positive changes in KEBAS were associated with having tertiary education as compared to none ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	Health education improves knowledge about epilepsy , but once only contact does not improve adherence .
Conclusion	However , sustained education may improve adherence in future studies .

Background	India has @ million adult tobacco users and tobacco use is estimated to contribute to more than a million deaths in the country each year .
Background	There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate affordable , practicable and scalable interventions to promote cessation of tobacco use .
Background	Because tobacco use is so harmful , an increase of as little as @ percentage point in long-term quit success rates can have an important public health impact .
Background	This protocol paper describes the rationale and methods of a large randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief scalable smoking cessation intervention delivered by trained health professionals as an outreach programme in poor urban communities in India .
Method	This is a pragmatic , two-arm , community-based cluster randomized controlled trial focused on tobacco users in low-income communities .
Method	The treatment arm is a brief intervention comprising brief advice including training in craving control using simple yogic breathing exercises ( BA-YBA ) and the control arm is very brief advice ( VBA ) .
Method	Of a total of @ clusters , @ will be allocated to the intervention arm and @ to the control arm .
Method	Each cluster will have @ participants , making a total of @ participants .
Method	The primary outcome measure will follow the Russell Standard : self-report of sustained abstinence for at least @ months following the intervention confirmed at the final follow-up by salivary cotinine .
Conclusion	This trial will inform national and international policy on delivery of scalable and affordable brief outreach interventions to promote tobacco use cessation in low resource settings where tobacco users have limited access to physicians and medications .

Problem	Acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality but the relationship between LVEF and outcomes is unclear .
Problem	We explored the association between LVEF and @ and @day mortality in @ ADHF patients enrolled in the Acute Studies of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure ( ASCEND-HF ) trial .
Result	We explored the association between LVEF and @ and @ day mortality in @ ADHF patients enrolled in the Acute Studies of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure ( ASCEND-HF ) trial .
Result	LVEF was analysed both as a continuous variable and according to three categories : < @ % ( LowEF ) , @-@ % -LSB- intermediate EF ( IntEF ) -RSB- , and > @ % -LSB- preserved ejection fraction ( PresEF ) -RSB- .
Result	Of the patients in the trial , @ ( @ % ) had LowEF , @ ( @ % ) had IntEF , and @ ( @ % ) had PresEF .
Result	The unadjusted @ and @ day mortality was similar for LowEF ( @ % , @ % ) , IntEF ( @ % , @ % ) , and PresEF ( @ % , @ % ) , respectively ( P > @ ) .
Result	After multivariable adjustment , the hazard ratio ( HR ) for @ day mortality remained similar for the LowEF -LSB- HR @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ ; P = @ -RSB- and IntEF ( @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) compared to PresEF patients .
Result	By contrast , when LVEF was evaluated as a continuous measure , it exhibited a U-shaped pattern with mortality .
Result	After matching for age and sex , the mortality risk attributed to LVEF was attenuated , as the LVEF increased as a continuous variable over @ % .
Result	However , in patients with EF < @ % , the mortality risk continue to increase as the LVEF declined .
Conclusion	Among patients with ADHF , the unadjusted mortality rates are similar across LVEF strata .
Conclusion	However , after accounting for key patient variables , the mortality risk increases as EF falls below @ % .
Conclusion	These data will be useful in planning future studies of ADHF .

Problem	To test whether a prolonged @-hour infusion of meropenem @mg achieves an equivalent proportion of time above the minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ( % TMIC ) to that of meropenem @mg given over @ minutes .
Method	A randomised crossover study in @ critically ill patients .
Method	We administered meropenem as a @mg , @-minute infusion or as a @mg , @-hour infusion .
Method	We determined serial plasma concentrations for each dosing episode and performed comparisons of % TMIC at different MICs .
Method	The percentage of time that meropenem was above its MIC .
Result	For low MICs ( @ mg/L ) , both regimens attained a % TMIC > @ % in all patients .
Result	For an MIC of @mg/L , this target was attained in all but one patient , but with an MIC of @mg/L , three patients in each group had a % TMIC < @ % .
Result	There was no difference in target attainment between the two regimens for MICs up to @mg/L .
Result	There was marked variability in the pharmacokinetic and hence the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters between individuals .
Result	Several patients had elevated creatinine clearances and , with both regimens , their target attainment was poor .
Conclusion	Meropenem at @mg over @ minutes achieved a similar % TMIC to meropenem at @mg given over @ hours .
Conclusion	Meropenem pharmacokinetics were highly variable from individual to individual .

Background	Obesity is associated with a risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
Background	The pharmacodynamic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors has not been specifically evaluated in obese subjects .
Background	The aim of this study was to compare the antisecretory response to a single oral dose of @ mg rabeprazole , @ mg omeprazole and placebo in obese subjects .
Method	Gastric pH was monitored for @ hours on three separate occasions in eighteen H. pylori-negative , asymptomatic obese subjects .
Method	Subjects were given omeprazole , rabeprazole or placebo in a randomized order and in a double-blind fashion .
Method	The main analysis criterion was @-h percent of time post dose with intragastric pH above @ ; secondary criteria were percentage of time above pH @ , median pH , -LSB- H + -RSB- concentrations and nocturnal acid breakthrough ( NAB ) .
Method	Results were analyzed using linear mixed models and Wilks test comparing variances .
Result	@-h median -LSB- IQ -RSB- percentages of time with gastric pH above @ and @ were higher with rabeprazole than omeprazole ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- % , @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- % for placebo ) but the differences did not reach statistical significance ( p = @ and @ , respectively ) .
Result	Median acid concentrations were significantly lower with rabeprazole than with omeprazole and placebo ( @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- mmoles/l , p < @ ) for all periods .
Result	The number of NAB was significantly lower with rabeprazole than with omeprazole ( median @ -LSB- @,@ -RSB- vs. @ -LSB- @-@ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	Variances of @-h data ( pH above @ and @ , median pH , -LSB- H + -RSB- concentrations ) were significantly lower with rabeprazole than with omeprazole ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	In asymptomatic obese subjects the gastric antisecretory response to a single dose of rabeprazole and omeprazole was strong and not significantly different between drugs despite a significantly more homogeneous response with rabeprazole .

Problem	This randomised phase II trial aimed to compare efficacy of the irreversible ErbB family blocker , afatinib , with cetuximab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma ( mCRC ) with progression following oxaliplatin - and irinotecan-based regimens .
Problem	Efficacy in patients with KRAS mutations was also evaluated .
Method	Patients with KRAS wild-type tumours were randomised @:@ to afatinib ( @ mg/day , increasing to @ mg/day if minimal toxicity ) or cetuximab weekly ( @ mg/m@ loading dose , then @ mg/m@/week ) according to number of previous chemotherapy lines .
Method	All patients with KRAS-mutated tumours received afatinib .
Method	Primary end-points were objective response ( OR ) for the wild-type group and disease control for the KRAS-mutated group .
Method	Secondary end-points were progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
Result	Patients with KRAS wild-type tumours ( n = @ ) received afatinib ( n = @ ) or cetuximab ( n = @ ) .
Result	Unconfirmed and confirmed ORs were @ % and @ % for afatinib versus @ % and @ % for cetuximab ( odds ratio : @ -LSB- P = @ -RSB- and < @ , respectively ) .
Result	Median PFS was @ and @ days for afatinib and cetuximab , respectively .
Result	Median OS was @ days with afatinib but not reached for cetuximab .
Result	In the KRAS-mutated group ( n = @ ) , five ( @ % ) patients achieved confirmed disease control ( stable disease ; P = @ -LSB- comparison versus @ % -RSB- ) ; no ORs were reported .
Result	Median PFS and OS were @ and @days , respectively .
Result	Most frequent treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea and rash across groups .
Conclusion	The efficacy of afatinib was inferior to cetuximab in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC .
Conclusion	In patients with KRAS-mutated tumours , disease control was modest with afatinib .
Conclusion	Afatinib had a manageable safety profile .

Background	Strategies are needed to help general practitioners ( GPs ) promote smoking cessation as recommended by guidelines .
Background	This study examines whether the quality of action planning among GPs improves their provision of smoking cessation care .
Method	The effectiveness of a @-h training programme was examined in a cluster randomised controlled trial in which @ GPs participated .
Method	GPs who followed the training ( intervention group ; n = @ ) formulated action plans related to i ) enquiring about smoking , ii ) advising to quit smoking , and iii ) arranging follow-up for smokers motivated to quit .
Method	GPs also formulated a coping plan for encountering smokers not motivated to quit .
Method	The quality of these plans ( plan specificity ) was rated and , @ weeks after the training , GPs reported on the performance of these plans ( plan enactment ) .
Method	Multilevel regression analyses were used to examine the effects of plan specificity and plan enactment on patient-reported smoking cessation activities of the GPs in the intervention group ( n = @,@ patients ) compared with the control group ( n = @,@ patients ) .
Result	Compared to the control group , GPs who formulated a highly specific action plan during the training asked their patients about smoking more often after the training compared to prior to the training ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	GPs were most likely to have asked patients about smoking after the training compared to prior to the training when they had enacted a highly specific formulated action plan ( OR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	The effects of GP plan specificity and plan enactment on asking patient about smoking were most prominent among GPs who , at baseline , intended to provide smoking cessation care .
Conclusion	A highly specific action plan formulated by a GP on when , how , and by whom patients will be asked about smoking had a positive effect on GPs ' asking patients about smoking , especially when these professionals also reported to have enacted this plan .
Conclusion	This effect was most prominent among GPs who intended to provide smoking cessation care prior to the intervention .
Conclusion	Training in devising personalised coping plans is recommended to further increase GPs ' provision of advice to quit smoking and arranging follow-up support to quit smoking .

Problem	Delirium is common during critical illness and associated with adverse outcomes .
Problem	We compared characteristics and outcomes of delirious and nondelirious patients enrolled in a multicenter trial comparing protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption .
Method	Randomized trial .
Method	Sixteen North American medical and surgical ICUs .
Method	Four hundred thirty critically ill , mechanically ventilated adults .
Method	All patients had hourly titration of opioid and benzodiazepine infusions using a validated sedation scale .
Method	For patients in the interruption group , infusions were resumed , if indicated , at half of previous doses .
Method	Delirium screening occurred daily ; positive screening was defined as an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score of @ or more at any time .
Result	Delirium was diagnosed in @ of @ assessed patients ( @ % ) .
Result	Coma was identified in @ % of delirious compared with @ % of nondelirious patients ( p = @ ) .
Result	The median time to onset of delirium was @ days ( interquartile range , @-@ ) , and the median duration of delirium was @ days ( interquartile range , @-@ ) .
Result	Delirious patients were more likely to be male ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , have a surgical/trauma diagnosis ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , and history of tobacco ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) or alcohol use ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) .
Result	Patients with positive delirium screening had longer duration of ventilation ( @ vs @ d ; p < @ ) , ICU stay ( @ vs @ d ; p < @ ) , and hospital stay ( @ vs @ d ; p < @ ) .
Result	Delirious patients were more likely to be physically restrained ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) and undergo tracheostomy ( @ % vs @ % ; p < @ ) .
Result	Antecedent factors independently associated with delirium onset were restraint use ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) , antipsychotic administration ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) , and midazolam dose ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
Result	There was no difference in delirium prevalence or duration between the interruption and control groups .
Conclusion	In mechanically ventilated adults , delirium was common and associated with longer duration of ventilation and hospitalization .
Conclusion	Physical restraint was most strongly associated with delirium .

Background	Amino-acid ( AA ) metabolic signatures differ in insulin-resistant ( IR ) obese vs normal-weight subjects , improve after weight loss , and seem to predict the risk of type @ diabetes .
Background	It is unknown whether weight-maintaining dietary measures aimed at influencing IR alter AA signatures of high-risk subjects .
Method	In the randomized controlled Protein , Fiber and Metabolic Syndrome ( ProFiMet ) trial we investigated effects of four isoenergetic , moderately fat-reduced diets varying in protein and cereal-fiber contents on complete AA metabolic signatures in @ group-matched overweight or obese high-risk subjects .
Method	We analyzed the relation of whole-body and hepatic IR with AA signatures , body fat composition and liver fat , after @ , @ , and @ weeks of dietary intervention .
Method	Discrimination between diets was further enhanced by providing tailored dietary supplements for twice-daily consumption over @ weeks in all groups .
Result	Baseline AA , including branched-chain signatures significantly related to IR , liver fat , and visceral fat mass .
Result	Isoenergetic variation of protein and cereal-fiber dietary contents , but not fat restriction , significantly influenced IR , whereas the relation of AA with IR changed with all diets .
Result	The tryptophan ratio was significantly suppressed in obese vs overweight participants , but increased after @ weeks of high cereal-fiber intake to a nonobese phenotype .
Result	Modeling analyses revealed diet-induced alterations of complex AA profiles to relate to @ % and @ % of changes in whole-body and hepatic IR .
Conclusion	We demonstrate that relatively short-term isoenergetic changes in the diet significantly alter the relation of AA signatures with IR , with possible implications on the determination and treatment of diabetes risk .

Problem	We tested the impact of banning tobacco displays and posting graphic health warning signs at the point of sale ( POS ) .
Method	We designed @ variations of the tobacco product display ( open , enclosed -LSB- not visible -RSB- , enclosed with pro-tobacco ads ) and @ variations of the warning sign ( present vs absent ) with virtual store software .
Method	In December @ and January @ , we randomized a national convenience sample of @ adult smokers and recent quitters to @ of @ store conditions and gave them a shopping task .
Method	We tested for the main effects of the enclosed display , the sign , and their interaction on urge to smoke and tobacco purchase attempts .
Result	The enclosed display significantly lowered current smokers ' ( B = -@ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = -@ , -@ ; P < @ ) and recent quitters ' ( = -@ , @ % CI = -@ , -@ ; P < @ ) urge to smoke and current smokers ' purchase attempts ( adjusted odds ratio = @ ; @ % CI = @ , @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	The warning sign had no significant main effect on study outcomes or interaction with enclosed display .
Conclusion	These data show that POS tobacco displays influence purchase behavior .
Conclusion	Banning them may reduce cues to smoke and unplanned tobacco purchases .

Background	Acute stress produces behavioral and physiological changes modulated by central catecholamines ( CA ) .
Background	Stress increases CA activity , and depletion of CA stores reduces responses to stress .
Background	Increasing CA activity by administration of the dietary amino acid CA precursor tyrosine may increase responsiveness to stress .
Background	This study determined whether tyrosine enhances the ability of humans to respond to severe stress .
Method	Severe psychological stress was generated during training at Survival , Evasion , Resistance , and Escape ( SERE ) School .
Method	The acute stressor consisted of two mock interrogations conducted during several days of simulated captivity .
Method	Seventy-eight healthy male and female military personnel participated in this double-blind , between-subjects study , in which they received either tyrosine ( @mg/kg , N = @ ) or placebo ( N = @ ) .
Method	Tyrosine ( or placebo ) was administered in food bars in two doses of @mg/kg each approximately @min before each mock interrogation .
Method	Mood ( Profile of Mood States ) , saliva cortisol , and heart rate ( HR ) were assessed prior to stress exposure during a week of academic training preceding mock captivity and immediately following the mock interrogations .
Result	The severe stress produced robust effects on mood ( i.e. , increased tension , depression , anger , fatigue , vigor , and confusion ; p < @ ) , cortisol , and HR ( p < @ ) .
Result	Tyrosine increased anger ( p = @ , ANOVA treatment condition by test session interaction ) during stress but had no other effects .
Conclusion	Tyrosine did not alter most subjective or physiological responses to severe acute stress , but it increased ratings of anger .
Conclusion	The modest increase in anger may be an adaptive emotional response in stressful environments .

Background	In randomized clinical studies , over @,@ children , @ months to @ years of age , were administered ProQuad ( ) , a combination measles , mumps , rubella , and varicella vaccine ( MMRV ) .
Background	This paper describes the safety following a @-dose regimen of MMRV administered to children in the second year of life .
Method	Safety data from five clinical studies were combined for all children who were scheduled to receive two doses of MMRV @-@ months apart .
Method	All vaccinated children were followed for safety following each dose of MMRV .
Result	Of @ children who received a first dose of MMRV , @ ( @ % ) received a second dose of MMRV .
Result	Overall , @ % and @ % of children reported @ adverse experiences following first and second doses of MMRV , respectively .
Result	Injection-site redness was statistically significantly higher postdose @ than postdose @ , while injection-site pain/tenderness was statistically significantly higher postdose @ compared to postdose @ .
Result	Rashes were statistically significantly lower postdose @ compared to postdose @ .
Result	Ten febrile seizures ( @ postdose @ , @ postdose @ ) were reported following MMRV vaccination .
Result	The incidence of febrile seizures postdose @ of MMRV was @ % ( @/@ ) compared to @ % ( @/@ ) postdose @ of MMRV .
Conclusion	Administration of two doses of MMRV has an acceptable safety profile in children @ to @ months of age .
Conclusion	There is a small increase in the risk of febrile seizures following the first dose of MMRV as compared to the component vaccines , but the risk for any individual child is relatively low .

Problem	To describe the prognostic value of three novel biomarkers for acute adverse kidney events compared with routine biological markers .
Method	We used high-end MS to quantify biomarkers predictive of acute kidney injury ( AKI ) and major adverse kidney events ( MAKE ) in @ adult patients after open heart surgery ( n = @ ) .
Result	Early postoperatively measured LG@ ( a C-terminal fragment of perlecan ) , LTBP@ ( latent transforming growth factor binding protein-@ ) , Cathepsin L as well as two other renal biomarkers ( NGAL , Cystatin C ) had greater predictive value for AKI ( n = @ ) and MAKE ( n = @ ) compared with creatinine , urea and urine output .
Conclusion	LG@ , LTBP@ and Cathepsin L deserve further exploration as biomarkers for the early identification of patients at risk of MAKE .

Problem	To compare patient preference for either sharp incision with scissors or blunt manual cleavage of the fascia at cesarean delivery in a randomized controlled trial in which each woman was her own control .
Method	Women undergoing primary cesarean delivery ( n = @ ) were randomized to side distribution of sharp or blunt incision of the fascia ( sharp right and blunt left or blunt right and sharp left ) and followed three months postoperatively .
Method	The primary outcome was patient preference for the right or left side of the scar @ months postoperatively and modeled by polytomous logistic regression .
Method	The secondary outcome was difference in pain between the two sides measured on a @-@ @ numerical rating scale at @ , @ , and @ days and @ and @ months postoperatively .
Method	Pain scores were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test .
Result	@ cases were analyzed and no significant difference was found in preference after three months .
Result	Nine women preferred the sharp ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ % ) and @ the blunt side ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ % ) ( P = @ ) .
Result	Pain scores did not differ significantly between the two sides at any time postoperatively either at rest or during mobilization .
Conclusion	No significant difference was found in patient preference with regard to sharp or blunt incision of the fascia , nor was there a significant difference in postoperative pain scores .

Background	Several planning studies have already proven the substantial dosimetric advantages of RapidArc ( RA ) over standard intensity-modulated radiotherapy .
Background	We retrospectively compared RapidArc and standard sliding window IMRT ( swIMRT ) in locally advanced head and neck cancer , looking both at dosimetrics as well as toxicity and outcome .
Method	CT datasets of @ patients treated with swIMRT and @ patients treated with RA were included .
Method	To compare the resulting dose distributions , the dose-volume parameters were evaluated for the planning target volumes ( PTVs ) , clinical target volumes ( CTVs ) , and organs at risk ( OARs ) , and the number of MU were calculated .
Method	Acute toxicity was assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria version @ .
Result	PTV coverage with the @ % isodose was slightly better for RA .
Result	Dose distribution has proven to be significantly more homogenous with RA and led to a reduction of @ % in MU with better OAR sparing .
Result	As for toxicity , more grade @ mucositis and dysphagia was observed for swIMRT , though we observed more grade @ dermatitis for RA .
Conclusion	In our retrospective analysis , RA had better target coverage and better sparing of the OAR .
Conclusion	Overall , the grade of acute toxicity was lower for RA than for swIMRT for the same types of tumor locations , except for the grade of dermatitis .

Background	Ankle sprains continue to pose a significant burden to the individual athlete , as well as to society as a whole .
Background	However , despite ankle sprains being the single most common sports injury and despite an active approach by various Dutch organisations in implementing preventive measures , large-scale community uptake of these preventive measures , and thus actual prevention of ankle sprains , is lagging well behind .
Background	In an attempt to bridge this implementation gap , the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute VeiligheidNL developed a freely available interactive App ( ` Strenghten your ankle ' translated in Dutch as : ` Versterk je enkel ; available for iOS and Android ) that contains - next to general advice on bracing and taping - a proven cost-effective neuromuscular program .
Background	The ` Strengthen your ankle ' App has not been evaluated against the ` regular ' prevention approach in which the neuromuscular program is advocated through written material .
Background	The aim of the current project is to evaluate the implementation value of the ` Strengthen your ankle ' App as compared to the usual practice of providing injured athletes with written materials .
Background	In addition , as a secondary outcome measure , the cost-effectiveness will be assessed against usual practice .
Method	The proposed study will be a randomised controlled trial .
Method	After stratification for medical caregiver , athletes will be randomised to two study groups .
Method	One group will receive a standardized eight-week proprioceptive training program that has proven to be cost-effective to prevent recurrent ankle injuries , consisting of a balance board ( machU / MSG Europe BVBA ) , and a traditional instructional booklet .
Method	The other group will receive the same exercise program and balance board .
Method	However , for this group the instructional booklet is exchanged by the interactive ` Strengthen your ankle ' App .
Conclusion	This trial is the first randomized controlled trial to study the implementation effectiveness of an App for proprioceptive balance board training program in comparison to a traditional printed instruction booklet , with the recurrence of ankle sprains among athletes as study outcome .
Conclusion	Results of this study could possibly lead to changes in practical guidelines on the treatment of ankle sprains and in the use of mobile applications for injury prevention .
Conclusion	Results will become available in @ .

Background	Asthma clinical guidelines suggest written asthma action plans are essential for improving self-management and outcomes .
Problem	To assess the efficacy of written instructions in the form of a written asthma action plan provided by subspecialist physicians as part of usual asthma care during office visits .
Method	A total of @ children and adults with persistent asthma receiving first-time care in pulmonary and allergy practices at @ urban medical centers were randomized to receive either written instructions ( n = @ ) or no written instructions other than prescriptions ( n = @ ) from physicians .
Result	Using written asthma action plan forms as a vehicle for providing self-management instructions did not have a significant effect on any of the primary outcomes : ( @ ) asthma symptom frequency , ( @ ) emergency visits , or ( @ ) asthma quality of life from baseline to @-month follow-up .
Result	Both groups showed similar and significant reductions in asthma symptom frequency ( daytime symptoms -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , nocturnal symptoms -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , - agonist use -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) .
Result	There was also a significant reduction in emergency visits for the intervention ( P < @ ) and control ( P < @ ) groups .
Result	There was significant improvement in asthma quality-of-life scores for adults ( P < @ ) and pediatric caregivers ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our results suggest that using a written asthma action plan form as a vehicle for providing asthma management instructions to patients with persistent asthma who are receiving subspecialty care for the first time confers no added benefit beyond subspecialty-based medical care and education for asthma .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT @ ) .

Background	This study evaluates if there is any benefit of adding epinephrine to lidocaine in patients undergoing diagnostic rigid nasal endoscopy .
Background	A prospective , randomized , double-blinded study was performed .
Method	Seventy patients were randomized to receive either @ % lidocaine or @ % lidocaine with @ % epinephrine before rigid nasal endoscopy examination .
Method	Patients were asked to report the intensity of pain and discomfort they experienced using visual analog scale .
Method	An endoscopist recorded the ease to perform the procedure using the same scale .
Method	Intranasal structures visualized were also reported .
Result	There were no significant differences in pain , discomfort or ease of exam , or in the percentage of visualized nasal structures between the two groups .
Result	In the whole series , there were no significant differences in the studied variables based on gender or indication to perform endoscopy .
Conclusion	Adding epinephrine to lidocaine has no advantages in patients undergoing diagnostic rigid nasal endoscopy .

Background	Photodynamic therapy is an effective tool in the management of some forms of skin cancer and generalized solar dermopathy and can be beneficial in the management of acne vulgaris .
Background	When used as an area treatment one of the main limiters is the quite severe burning pain that patients feel during the illumination phase of the treatment .
Problem	To examine the effectiveness of a plant derived anti-nociceptive spray applied prior to and during large area photodynamic therapy .
Method	A split face or left arm versus right arm , placebo controlled trial was performed on @ patients to assess the effectiveness of the spray in reducing pain perception .
Result	There was a statistically significant reduction in pain at all illumination points during the illumination phase but no significant difference in discomfort levels in the first @ h post illumination .
Conclusion	Only large area photodynamic therapy treatment was performed during the study .
Conclusion	No conclusions can be drawn for small area treatments .
Conclusion	Use of a simple , plant derived anti-nociceptive spray can reduce the discomfort experienced by patients undergoing photodynamic therapy to large areas .

Background	Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction is well documented in the literature .
Background	The cause of this tunnel enlargement is unclear , but is thought to be multifactorial , with mechanical and biological factors playing a role .
Problem	The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate how the different techniques may affect the bone tunnel enlargement and clinical outcome .
Method	Forty-five consecutive patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with autologous doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons entered this study .
Method	They were randomly assigned to enter group A ( In-Out technique , with cortical fixation and Interference screw ) and group B ( Out-In technique , metal cortical fixation on the femour and tibia ) .
Method	At a mean follow-up of @ months , all the patients underwent CT scan exam to evaluate the post-operative diameters of both femoral and they underwent tibial tunnels clinical examination after @ months .
Result	The mean femoral tunnel diameter increased significantly from @ mm to @ mm in group A and from @ mm to @ mm in group B.
Result	The mean increase in femoral tunnel diameters observed in group A was significantly higher than that observed in group B ( p < @ ) The mean tibial tunnel diameter increased significantly from @ mm to @ mm in group A and from @ mm to @ mm in group B.
Result	The mean increase in tibial tunnel diameters observed in group A was significantly higher than that observed in group B ( p < @ ) .
Result	No clinical differences were found between two groups and no correlations between clinical and radiological results were found in any patients of both groups .
Conclusion	Results of the study suggest that different mechanical fixation devices could influence tunnel widening .
Conclusion	The lower stiffness of the fixation devices is probably responsible of the tunnel widening through the fixation devices 's micromotions in the femoral and tibial tunnels .

Problem	The association between low birthweight ( LBW ) and risk of developing type @ diabetes may involve epigenetic mechanisms , with skeletal muscle being a prime target tissue .
Problem	Differential DNA methylation patterns have been observed in single genes in muscle tissue from type @ diabetic and LBW individuals , and we recently showed multiple DNA methylation changes during short-term high-fat overfeeding in muscle of healthy people .
Problem	In a randomised crossover study , we analysed genome-wide DNA promoter methylation in skeletal muscle of @ young LBW men and @ matched normal birthweight ( NBW ) men after a control and a @ day high-fat overfeeding diet .
Method	DNA methylation was measured using Illumina 's Infinium BeadArray covering @,@ CpG sites representing @,@ different genes .
Result	After correction for multiple comparisons , DNA methylation levels were found to be similar in the LBW and NBW groups during the control diet .
Result	Whereas widespread DNA methylation changes were observed in the NBW group in response to high-fat overfeeding , only a few methylation changes were seen in the LBW group ( ( @ ) , p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our results indicate lower DNA methylation plasticity in skeletal muscle from LBW vs NBW men , potentially contributing to understanding the link between LBW and increased risk of type @ diabetes .

Background	The relationships of left ventricular ( LV ) longitudinal and circumferential systolic dysfunction with diastolic performance in hypertensive patients have never been compared .
Result	In @ asymptomatic hypertensive patients , circumferential function was assessed with the use of midwall fractional shortening ( mFS ) and stress-corrected mFS ( SCmFS ) , whereas longitudinal function was assessed with the use of left atrioventricular plane displacement ( AVPD ) and systolic mitral annulus velocity ( s ' ) .
Result	Early diastolic annular velocity ( e ' ) and the E/e ' ratio were measured .
Result	Global longitudinal and circumferential strain were determined in a subset of @ patients .
Result	e ' was linearly related to all systolic indexes ( AVPD : R = @ ; s ' : R = @ ; mFS : R = @ ; SCmFS : R = @ ; all P < @ ) , but the correlations were stronger with longitudinal indexes than with circumferential ones ( P < @ ) .
Result	E/e ' was nonlinearly related to AVPD ( R = -@ ; P < @ ) and s ' ( R = -@ ; P < @ ) and showed no relationship with mFS and SCmFS .
Result	Longitudinal indexes were superior to circumferential ones in predicting e ' < @ cm/s , E/e ' < @ , and E/e ' @ .
Result	The effect of LV geometry on LV diastolic function was evident among patients with preserved systolic longitudinal function , but was blunted among patients with impaired longitudinal function .
Result	In multivariable analyses , only longitudinal indexes remained associated with e ' and E/e ' .
Result	Analyses using strains provided similar results .
Conclusion	In asymptomatic hypertensive subjects , LV diastolic performance is independently associated with longitudinal systolic dysfunction , but not with circumferential systolic dysfunction .
Conclusion	Subtle longitudinal systolic impairment plays a role in mediating the effect of LV geometry on diastolic performance .
Conclusion	These findings may support the need of critically revising the concept of isolated diastolic dysfunction in these patients .

Background	Certain disorders , such as depression and anxiety , to which serotonin dysfunction is historically associated , are also associated with lower assessments of other people 's trustworthiness .
Background	Serotonergic changes are known to alter cognitive responses to threatening stimuli .
Background	This effect may manifest socially as reduced apparent trustworthiness of others .
Background	Trustworthiness judgments can emerge from either direct observation or references provided by third parties .
Problem	We assessed whether explicit judgments of trustworthiness and social influences on those judgments are altered by changes within serotonergic systems .
Method	We implemented a double-blind between-subject design where @ healthy female volunteers received a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) citalopram ( @ mg ) , while @ control subjects ( matched on age , intelligence , and years of education ) received a placebo .
Method	Subjects performed a face-rating task assessing how trustworthy they found @ unfamiliar others ( targets ) .
Method	After each rating , the subjects were told how other subjects , on average , rated the same target .
Method	The subjects then performed @ min of distractor tasks before , unexpectedly , being asked to rate all @ faces again , in a random order .
Result	Compared to subjects receiving a placebo , subjects receiving citalopram rated targets as less trustworthy .
Result	They also conformed more to opinions of others , when others rated targets to be even less trustworthy than subjects had initially indicated .
Result	The two effects were independent of negative effects of citalopram on subjective state .
Conclusion	This is evidence that serotonin systems can mediate explicit assessment and social learning of the trustworthiness of others .

Problem	Compare public perceptions and intentions to undergo colorectal cancer screening tests following detailed information regarding CT colonography ( CTC ; after non-laxative preparation or full-laxative preparation ) , optical colonoscopy ( OC ) or flexible sigmoidoscopy ( FS ) .
Method	A total of @,@ invitees approaching screening age ( @-@ years ) were randomly allocated to receive detailed information on a single test and asked to return a questionnaire .
Method	Outcomes included perceptions of preparation and test tolerability , health benefits , sensitivity and specificity , and intention to undergo the test .
Result	Six hundred three invitees responded with valid questionnaire data .
Result	Non-laxative preparation was rated more positively than enema or full-laxative preparations -LSB- effect size ( r ) = @ to @ ; p < @ to @ -RSB- ; both forms of CTC and FS were rated more positively than OC in terms of test experience ( r = @ to @ ; all p-values < @ ) .
Result	Perceptions of health benefits , sensitivity and specificity ( p = @ to @ ) , and intention to undergo the test ( p = @ ) did not differ between tests ( n = @-@ for each test ) .
Conclusion	Despite non-laxative CTC being rated more favourably , this study did not find evidence that offering it would lead to substantially higher uptake than full-laxative CTC or other methods .
Conclusion	However , this study was limited by a lower than anticipated response rate .
Conclusion	Improving uptake of colorectal cancer screening tests could improve health benefits Potential invitees rate CTC and flexible sigmoidoscopy more positively than colonoscopy Non-laxative bowel preparation is rated better than enema or full-laxative preparations These positive perceptions alone may not be sufficient to improve uptake Health benefits and accuracy are rated similarly for preventative screening tests .

Problem	Fear of childbirth is a common reason for seeking cesarean section .
Problem	It is important to consider outcomes and costs associated with alternative treatment and delivery mode .
Problem	We compared well-being and costs of group psychoeducation and conventional care for fear of childbirth .
Method	Randomized controlled trial .
Method	A total of @ nulliparous women scoring over the @th centile in the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire ( W-DEQ ) during the first trimester .
Method	Finland , data from obstetrical patient records and questionnaires .
Method	Randomization to group psychoeducation with relaxation ( six sessions during pregnancy , one after childbirth , n = @ ) , or surveillance and referral on demand ( n = @ ) .
Method	All costs in maternity care during pregnancy , delivery and postnatally according to Diagnoses Related Groups .
Method	Life satisfaction and general well-being @ months after childbirth ( by a Satisfaction with Life Scale and Well-being Visual Analogue Scale ) .
Result	The groups did not differ in total direct costs ( @/woman in psychoeducative group and @/woman in control group ) , nor in life satisfaction or general well-being .
Result	Although only @ ( @ % ) of the women assigned to the surveillance were referred to special maternity care and @ ( @ % ) attended advanced prenatal classes , costs in the psychoeducation group did not exceed the costs of the controls , mostly because of the greater number of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Through an association with safer childbirth and equal well-being after delivery , psychoeducative group treatment for nulliparous women with fear of childbirth can be a recommended choice for the same overall costs as conventional treatment .

Problem	To determine whether fitness-center attendance established with the provision of weekly monetary incentives persisted after the discontinuation , or decreased frequency , of incentives .
Method	One hundred seventeen first-year college students participated during the @-@ academic year .
Method	A randomized controlled trial with control , discontinued-incentive , and continued-incentive conditions was conducted .
Method	During fall semester , students in incentive conditions received weekly monetary payments for meeting fitness-center attendance goals .
Method	During spring semester , discontinued-incentive condition participants no longer received incentives , whereas continued-incentive condition participants received payments on a variable-interval schedule .
Method	ID-card attendance records tracked fitness-center attendance .
Result	Goal completion decreased from @ % in the incentive groups during the fall semester to @ % in the discontinued-incentive condition , and @ % in the continued-incentive condition during the spring semester .
Result	There was not a significant interaction between condition and body mass index change , F ( @ , @ ) = @ , p = @ .
Conclusion	Incentive discontinuation resulted in students no longer meeting fitness-center attendance goals .
Conclusion	A variable-interval reward schedule better maintained attendance .

Problem	Early laryngeal cancer is usually treated with either transoral laser surgery or radiation therapy .
Problem	The quality of voice achieved with these treatments has not been compared in a randomized trial .
Method	Male patients with carcinoma limited to @ mobile vocal cord ( T@aN@M@ ) were randomly assigned to receive either laser surgery ( n = @ ) or external beam radiation therapy ( n = @ ) .
Method	Surgery consisted of tumor excision with a CO@ laser with the patient under general anaesthesia .
Method	External beam radiation therapy to the larynx was delivered to a cumulative dose of @ Gy in @-Gy daily fractions over @ weeks .
Method	Voice quality was assessed at baseline and @ and @ months after treatment .
Method	The main outcome measures were expert-rated voice quality on a grade , roughness , breathiness , asthenia , and strain ( GRBAS ) scale , videolaryngostroboscopic findings , and the patients ' self-rated voice quality and its impact on activities of daily living .
Result	Overall voice quality between the groups was rated similar , but voice was more breathy and the glottal gap was wider in patients treated with laser surgery than in those who received radiation therapy .
Result	Patients treated with radiation therapy reported less hoarseness-related inconvenience in daily living @ years after treatment .
Result	Three patients in each group had local cancer recurrence within @ years from randomization .
Conclusion	Radiation therapy may be the treatment of choice for patients whose requirements for voice quality are demanding .
Conclusion	Overall voice quality was similar in both treatment groups , however , indicating a need for careful consideration of patient-related factors in the choice of a treatment option .

Problem	To examine the association between individual drug use and peer leaders use .
Method	Analysis of drug use behaviors of @ students randomized into three arms-control , standard , and networked where peers serve as group leaders .
Result	Among the combined male and female group , there was no association between peer leader and individual use .
Result	Among males , peer leader use at baseline was positively associated with individual alcohol use at post-test .
Result	Among females , peer leader use at post-test was negatively associated with marijuana and cigarette use .
Conclusion	Having peer leaders in the network condition decreased the odds of marijuana and cigarette use among females .
Conclusion	The opposite effect was found in males .

Problem	The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy and ultrasound therapy in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome .
Method	Thirty one patients with subacromial impingement syndrome were randomly assigned to low-level laser therapy group ( n = @ ) and ultrasound therapy group ( n = @ ) .
Method	Study participants received @ treatment sessions of low-level laser therapy or ultrasound therapy over a period of two-consecutive weeks ( five days per week ) .
Method	Outcome measures ( visual analogue pain scale , Shoulder Pain and Disability Index - SPADI - , patient 's satisfactory level and sleep interference score ) were assessed before treatment and at the @st and @rd months after treatment .
Method	All patients were analyzed by the intent-to-treat principle .
Result	Mean reduction in VAS pain , SPADI disability and sleep interference scores from baseline to after @ month , and @ months of treatment was statistically significant in both groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	However , there was no significant difference in the mean change in VAS pain , SPADI disability and sleep interference scores between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
Result	The mean level of patient satisfaction in group @ at the first and third months after treatment was @ @ mm and @ @ mm , respectively .
Result	The mean level of patient satisfaction in group @ at the first and third months after treatment was @ @ mm and @ @ mm , respectively .
Result	There was no significant difference in the mean level of patient satisfaction between the two groups ( p > @ ) .
Conclusion	The results suggest that efficacy of both treatments were comparable to each other in regarding reducing pain severity and functional disability in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome .
Conclusion	Based on our findings , we conclude that low-level laser therapy may be considered as an effective alternative to ultrasound based therapy in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome especially ultrasound based therapy is contraindicated .

Background	Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction .
Background	Inflammation and adverse remodeling of the extracellular matrix may be involved in the pathogenesis .
Background	Statins reduce levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol , but may also attenuate inflammation and affect matrix remodeling .
Background	We hypothesized that treatment with rosuvastatin would reduce or even reverse left ventricular remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy .
Method	In this multicenter , randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled study , @ patients were randomized to @ mg of rosuvastatin or matching placebo .
Method	Physical examination , blood sampling , echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline and at six months ' follow-up .
Method	The pre-specified primary end point was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to six months .
Result	Over all , left ventricular ejection fraction improved @ percentage points over the duration of the study , but there was no difference in the change in left ventricular ejection fraction between patients allocated to rosuvastatin and those allocated to placebo .
Result	Whereas serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration fell significantly in the treatment arm , rosuvastatin did not affect plasma or serum levels of a wide range of inflammatory variables , including C-reactive protein .
Result	The effect on markers of extracellular matrix remodeling was modest .
Conclusion	Treatment with rosuvastatin does not improve left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy .

Problem	Cognitive interventions increasingly complement psychopharmacological treatment to enhance symptomatic and functional outcome in schizophrenia .
Problem	Metacognitive training ( MCT ) is targeted at cognitive biases involved in the pathogenesis of delusions .
Problem	To examine the long-term efficacy of group MCT for schizophrenia in order to explore whether previously established effects were sustained .
Method	A @-center , randomized , controlled , assessor-blind , parallel group trial was conducted .
Method	A total of @ inpatients or outpatients with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorders were enrolled .
Method	All patients were prescribed antipsychotic medication .
Method	The second follow-up assessment took place @ years later after the intervention phase was terminated .
Method	Group MCT targeting cognitive biases vs neuropsychological training ( COGPACK ) .
Method	Patients received a maximum of @ sessions .
Method	The primary outcome measure was a delusion score derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
Method	The PANSS positive syndrome and total scores , the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales , the jumping to conclusions bias , self-esteem , and quality of life served as secondary outcome measures .
Result	The intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated that patients in the MCT group had significantly greater reductions in the core PANSS delusion score , after @ years compared with the control group ( @partial = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	Among the secondary outcomes , the intention-to-treat analyses also demonstrated that patients in the MCT group had significantly greater reductions in the PANSS positive syndrome score ( @partial = @ ; P = @ ) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales delusion score ( @partial = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	Significant group differences at the @-year follow-up were also found on measures of self-esteem and quality of life , which did not distinguish groups at earlier assessment points .
Result	Attention was improved in the neuropsychological training group relative to the MCT group .
Result	The completion rate was @ % after @ years .
Conclusion	Metacognitive training demonstrated sustained effects in the reduction of delusions , which were over and above the effects of antipsychotic medication .
Conclusion	Moreover , there were some unanticipated ( `` sleeper '' ) effects as both self-esteem and quality of life were improved after @ years .
Conclusion	Effects on self-esteem and well-being were found even in the absence of an improvement on the jumping to conclusions bias .

Problem	This study aims to determine the outcome of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction using an allograft in comparison with ACL reconstruction using a double-bundle autograft or a single-bundle allograft .
Method	A total of @ patients who accepted primary ACL reconstructions were divided randomly into three groups : double-bundle technique with autograft ( DB-AU group , n = @ ) , double-bundle technique with allograft ( DB-AL group , n = @ ) , and single-bundle technique with allograft ( SB group , n = @ ) .
Method	The KT-@ arthrometer and pivot-shift tests were performed at @ , @ , and @ months after surgery , and clinical outcome measurements include the Lysholm score and the IKDC rating scales .
Method	Radiological assessments evaluated arthritic changes and tunnel expansion at @ months postoperatively .
Result	The KT-@ test scores in the DB-AU and DB-AL groups were significantly better than those in the SB group at @ and @ months postoperatively ( P < @ ) .
Result	The pivot-shift tests scores in the DB-AU and DB-AL groups were significantly better than those in the SB group at the @ , @ , and @ month follow-ups ( P < @ ) .
Result	Based on the IKDC score and Lysholm score , there were no significant difference between the three groups during follow-up ( P > @ ) .
Result	At @ months postoperatively , @ % of patients in the SB group showed a progression in arthritic changes , which was greater than in the DB-AU ( @ % ) and DB-AL ( @ % ) groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	At @ months , the rates of tunnel expansion in the DB-AU group and the DB-AL group were lower than in the SB group ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Double-bundle ACL reconstruction can be used to achieve better anterior and rotational stability and has a lower rate of arthritic progression and tunnel expansion than the single-bundle procedure .

Problem	Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) continues to be evaluated and recommended as treatment and prophylaxis for various diseases .
Problem	We recently assessed efficacy of high-dose DHA supplementation to slow vision loss in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa ( XLRP ) in a randomized clinical trial .
Problem	Because DHA is a highly unsaturated fatty acid , it could serve as a target for free-radical induced oxidation , resulting in increased oxidative stress .
Problem	Biosafety was monitored during the @-year trial to determine whether DHA supplementation was associated with identifiable risks .
Method	Males ( n = @ ; @-@ years ) meeting entry criteria were enrolled .
Method	The modified intent-to-treat cohort ( DHA = @ ; placebo = @ ) adhered to the protocol @ year .
Method	Participants were randomized to an oral dose of @ mg/kg/d DHA or placebo plus a daily multivitamin .
Method	Comprehensive metabolic analyses were assessed for group differences .
Method	Treatment-emergent adverse events including blood chemistry metabolites were recorded .
Result	By year @ , supplementation elevated plasma and red blood cell-DHA @ - and @-fold , respectively , compared with the placebo group ( P < @ ) .
Result	Over the trial duration , no significant differences between DHA and placebo groups were found for vitamin A , vitamin E , platelet aggregation , antioxidant activity , lipoprotein cholesterol , or oxidized LDL levels ( all P > @ ) .
Result	Adverse events were transient and not considered severe ( e.g. , gastrointestinal -LSB- GI -RSB- irritability , blood chemistry alterations ) .
Result	One participant was unable to tolerate persistent GI discomfort .
Conclusion	Long-term , high-dose DHA supplementation to patients with XLRP was associated with limited safety risks in this @-year trial .
Conclusion	Nevertheless , GI symptoms should be monitored in all patients taking high dose DHA especially those with personal or family history of GI disturbances .
Conclusion	( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Background	Tenofovir ( TDF ) is associated with phosphaturia and elevated @,@ dihydroxy vitamin D ( @,@-OH ( @ ) D ) .
Background	Fibroblast growth factor @ ( FGF@ ) causes phosphaturia and increases in response to elevated @,@-OH ( @ ) D. Vitamin D-binding protein ( VDBP ) binds to @,@-OH ( @ ) D , decreasing its biological activity , and is elevated in individuals with higher plasma tenofovir concentrations .
Background	We compared FGF@ and VDBP before and after vitamin D@ ( VITD ) supplementation in youths treated with combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) containing or not containing TDF .
Method	A randomized controlled trial in HIV-positive youths aged @-@ years enrolled participants based on cART treatment with TDF ( TDF ; n = @ ) or without TDF ( no-TDF ; n = @ ) , and randomized within those groups to VITD ( @,@ IU every @ weeks ) or placebo ( PL ) .
Method	We measured FGF@ and VDBP and calculated free @,@-OH ( @ ) D at baseline and week @ , and compared changes by TDF treatment and VITD randomized group .
Result	At baseline , serum FGF@ concentration showed a quadratic relationship with @,@-OH ( @ ) D most pronounced in the TDF group .
Result	At week @ , total and free @,@-OH ( @ ) D increased in the VITD but not PL groups , independent of TDF use .
Result	FGF@ increased in the TDF group receiving VITD , but there was no FGF@ change in the no-TDF group receiving VITD or the PL groups .
Result	The adjusted mean change in FGF@ from baseline to week @ was @ pg/ml in the TDF/VITD group , compared with -@ ( no-TDF/VITD , P = @ ) , -@ ( TDF/PL , P = @ ) and @ ( no-TDF/PL , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	These results suggest that TDF-containing cART may alter the FGF@ response to vitamin D supplementation in HIV-infected youths .
Conclusion	Clinical trials number : NCT@ .

Problem	The high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with resistant hypertension could be mediated by an activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system .
Problem	This study assessed the impact of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment on plasma aldosterone concentration ( PAC ) .
Method	One hundred and twenty-four patients with resistant hypertension were assessed , and those who fulfilled inclusion criteria ( n = @ ) underwent full night polysomnography , @-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , and PAC measurement .
Method	Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index above @ ( n = @ ) were randomized to CPAP ( n = @ ) or to conventional treatment ( n = @ ) for @ months .
Result	Seventy-eight patients completed the follow-up ( @ CPAP , @ conventional treatment ) ; @ had true resistant hypertension ( @ % ) , whereas @ had white-coat resistant hypertension ( @ % ) .
Result	Most patients were men ( @ % ) , age @ years , and the mean apnea-hypopnea index was @ .
Result	In patients with true resistant hypertension , CPAP achieved a significant decrease in most @-h BP measurements and a nonsignificant decrease in PAC ( @ vs. @ ng/dl ; P < @ ) .
Result	In patients with white-coat resistant hypertension , CPAP achieved a significant decrease in PAC ( @ vs. @ ng/dl ; P < @ ) and in night-time DBP .
Result	After adjustment , a weak but significant association was found between cumulative time spent with SaO@ below @ % ( CT@ % ) and baseline PAC ( P < @ , R @ ) , and between changes in PAC and changes in office DBP ( P < @ , R @ ) CONCLUSIONS : : Night-time hypoxemia and changes in DBP showed an association with baseline and changes in PAC , respectively .
Result	CPAP achieved a significant reduction in PAC only in patients with white-coat resistant hypertension , although the CPAP effect on BP was highest in patients with true resistant hypertension .

Problem	The prognostic importance of the speed of early hematoma growth in acute intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) has not been well established .
Problem	We aimed to determine the association between the rate of increase in hematoma volume and major clinical outcomes in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial ( INTERACT ) studies .
Problem	The effects of early intensive blood pressure ( BP ) lowering according to the speed of hematoma growth were also investigated .
Method	Pooled analyses of the INTERACT@ ( n = @ ) and INTERACT@ ( n = @,@ ) studies-randomized controlled trials of patients with spontaneous ICH with elevated systolic BP , randomly assigned to intensive ( target systolic BP < @ mm Hg ) or guideline-based ( < @ mm Hg ) BP management .
Method	The speed of ultraearly hematoma growth ( UHG ) was defined as hematoma volume ( mL ) / onset-to-CT time ( hours ) .
Method	Primary outcome was death or major disability ( modified Rankin Scale score of @-@ ) at @ days .
Result	Among a total of @,@ patients ( @ % ) with information on UHG and outcome , median speed of UHG was @ mL/h .
Result	There was a linear association between UHG and outcome : multivariable-adjusted odd ratios @ ( @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) for @-@ mL/h and @ ( @-@ @ ) for > @ mL/h vs the < @ mL/h group .
Result	There were no clear differences in the effects of intensive BP lowering according to @ speeds of UHG on outcome ( p = @ for homogeneity ) .
Conclusion	The speed of UHG in patients with ICH was continuously associated with increased risks of death or major disability , and from lower levels than previously reported ( @ mL/h ) .
Conclusion	The benefits of intensive BP lowering appear to be independent of the speed of bleeding .

Problem	To compare the effectiveness of the traditional center of tibial plateau as the entry point and digital technology in the design of intramedullary tibial nail point positioning method in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) .
Method	Between October @ and October @ , @ cases undergoing unilateral TKA and meeting the selection criteria were randomly divided into @ groups : in group A ( @ cases ) , the tibial plateau center as the entry point of tibial intramedullary positioning was used ; in group B ( @ cases ) , Mimics @ software to simulate the guide rod point of tibial intramedullary positioning was used .
Method	There was no significant difference in gender , age , etiology , disease duration , sides , and preoperative knee range of motion , Hospital for Special Surgery ( HSS ) score , and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) between @ groups ( P > @ ) .
Method	Postoperative X-ray films were taken to measure the tibiofemoral angle and tibial angle ; knee range of motion , and HSS and WOMAC scores were used to assess the activity of knee .
Result	The entry point of group B was located in front of the center of tibial plateau , which was inconsistent with the traditional entry point .
Result	The incision healed by first intention in all patients of @ groups .
Result	The patients were followed up @ to @ months ( mean , @ months ) .
Result	The X-ray measurement at @ week after operation showed no significant difference in tibiofemoral angle between @ groups ( t = -@ , P = @ ) , but the anteroposterior and lateral tibial angles of group A were significantly lower than those of group B ( P < @ ) .
Result	The knee range of motion , HSS score , and WOMAC score of @ groups were significantly higher at @ and @ months after operation when compared with preoperative values ( P < @ ) , and the values at @ months were significantly increased than those at @ months after operation ( P < @ ) .
Result	HSS score and WOMAC score had no significant difference between @ groups at @ months after operation ( P > @ ) , but the scores of group B were significantly higher than those of group A at @ months ( P < @ ) .
Result	The knee range of motion of group B was significantly better than that of group A at @ months after operation ( t = @ , P = @ ) , but no significant difference was found between @ groups at @ months ( t = @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Compared with the traditional intramedullary guide rod insertion point positioning , digital individualized design of entry point positioning has the advantages of more accurate lower limb force line , better recovery of knee function , and earlier @ degrees activities , but the long-term effectiveness needs further observation .

Problem	To evaluate the effects of a home-monitoring device with tele-monitoring compared with standard care in detection of progression to choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) associated with age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , the leading cause of blindness in the US .
Method	Participants , aged @ to @ years , at high risk of developing CNV associated with AMD were recruited to the HOme Monitoring of Eye ( HOME ) Study , an unmasked , multi-center , randomized trial of the ForeseeHome ( FH ) device plus standard care vs. standard care alone .
Method	The FH device utilizes preferential hyperacuity perimetry and tele-monitoring to detect changes in vision function associated with development of CNV , potentially prior to symptom and visual acuity loss .
Method	After establishing baseline measurements , subsequent changes on follow-up are detected by the device , causing the monitoring center to alert the clinical center to recall participants for an exam .
Method	Standard care consists of instructions for self-monitoring visual changes with subsequent self-report to the clinical center .
Method	The primary objective of this study is to determine whether home monitoring plus standard care in comparison with standard care alone , results in earlier detection of incident CNV with better present visual acuity .
Method	The primary outcome is the decline in visual acuity at CNV diagnosis from baseline .
Method	Detection of CNV prior to substantial vision loss is critical as vision outcome following anti-angiogenic therapy is dependent on the visual acuity at initiation of treatment .
Conclusion	HOME Study is the first large scale study to test the use of home tele-monitoring system in the management of AMD patients .

Problem	There are significant health disparities between Mori and non-Mori with asthma , a pattern seen between other ethnic populations .
Problem	This study investigates outcomes for Mori in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) of combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler therapy in asthma .
Method	This @-week multicentre RCT recruited @ adult asthma patients , @ of whom were Mori .
Method	Participants were randomized to the single combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler as maintenance and reliever therapy ( ` SMART ' ) regimen or ` standard ' regimen ( combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler for maintenance and salbutamol as reliever ) .
Method	Outcomes included patterns of beta-agonist inhaler use including ` high use ' of reliever therapy ( > @ actuations of budesonide/formoterol in excess of four maintenance doses per day for SMART and > @ actuations per day of salbutamol for standard ) .
Method	Differences in outcomes for Mori versus non-Mori were assessed using an interaction term between ethnicity and treatment .
Result	With adjustment for ethnicity , the SMART group had fewer days of high use ( relative rate ( RR ) @ ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @-@ @ ) ) , days of high use without medical review within @ h ( RR @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ) and severe exacerbations ( RR @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ) compared with standard .
Result	The magnitude of the benefit from the SMART regimen was similar in Mori and non-Mori .
Result	Regardless of treatment regimen , Mori demonstrated more days of high use , high use without medical review and underuse of maintenance therapy .
Conclusion	The SMART regimen has a favourable risk/benefit profile in Mori .
Conclusion	Days of high use , days of high use without medical review and underuse of maintenance treatment were greater in Mori , regardless of treatment regimen .

Background	For decades thiopental has been considered as the hypnotic drug of choice for intracranial surgery .
Background	However , total intravenous anesthesia performed with thiopental is associated with delayed recovery , whereas early post-operative neurological evaluation is critical .
Background	For this reason , target controlled infusion ( TCI ) of propofol is increasingly used for maintenance of anesthesia .
Background	However , a thiopental TCI has never been assessed for this purpose .
Background	We tested the hypothesis that a thiopental TCI provides an acceptable way to achieve early recovery compared to a propofol TCI during supratentorial surgery .
Method	Eighty patients undergoing elective craniotomy for a supratentorial tumor were randomized to receive either a propofol TCI ( group P ) or a thiopental TCI ( group T ) .
Method	Both groups received a sufentanil TCI and the bispectral index was monitored .
Method	The primary end-point was time to tracheal extubation .
Method	Secondary end-points were per - and post-operative hemodynamics as well as respiratory and recovery parameters .
Method	Assessment of study end-points was performed by an intensive care specialist blinded ( like the patient ) to the received hypnotic .
Result	Time to extubation was significantly ( P < @ ) shorter in group P ( median @ minutes ; interquartile range @-@ minutes ) than in group T ( median @ minutes ; interquartile range @-@ minutes ) .
Result	Similarly , the recovery parameters were significantly better in group P than in group T.
Result	There was no difference between groups in terms of patient characteristics and hemodynamic parameters .
Conclusion	Even with TCI and bispectral index monitoring , thiopental is associated with an inappropriate delayed recovery from supratentorial surgery compared to propofol TCI .

Background	Stratification of patients for treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) is suboptimal , with high systemic overtreatment rates .
Method	A training set of @ tumours from women with pure DCIS were immunostained for proteins involved in cell survival , hypoxia , growth factor and hormone signalling .
Method	A generalised linear regression with regularisation and variable selection was applied to a multiple covariate Cox survival analysis with recurrence-free survival @-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out iterative approach were used to build and test the model that was validated using an independent cohort of @ patients with pure DCIS .
Method	The clinical role of a COX-@-targeting agent was then tested in a proof-of-concept neoadjuvant randomised trial in ER-positive DCIS treated with exemestane @ mg day ( -@ ) celecoxib @ mg day ( -@ ) .
Result	The COX-@ expression was an independent prognostic factor for early relapse in the training ( HR @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) P = @ ) and independent validation cohort ( HR @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant interaction with other clinicopathological variables .
Result	A statistically significant reduction of Ki-@ expression after treatment with exemestane celecoxib was observed ( P < @ ) with greater reduction in the combination arm ( P < @ ) .
Result	Concomitant reduction in COX-@ expression was statistically significant in the exemestane and celecoxib arm ( P < @ ) only .
Conclusion	In patients with DCIS , COX-@ may predict recurrence , aiding clinical decision making .
Conclusion	A combination of an aromatase inhibitor and celecoxib has significant biological effect and may be integrated into treatment of COX@-positive DCIS at high risk of recurrence .

Background	We introduced an initial large dose of modified St. Thomas ' Hospital cardioplegic solution with the aim of providing both myocardial protection as well as a smooth intraoperative process .
Method	In @ cases of isolated aortic valve replacement , we used the modified technique of cardioplegia in @ ( group S ) and conventional administration of glucose-insulin-potassium solution in @ ( group G ) .
Method	The patients were selected at random .
Method	In group S , we added @ mEq of potassium to the original St. Thomas ' Hospital solution and administered @mLkg ( -@ ) as an initial dose .
Method	The temperature was decreased to @ .
Result	The mean of reperfusion time after declamping in group S was significantly shorter ( @ @ vs. @ @ min ; p = @ ) .
Result	The average of postoperative maximum creatine kinase-MB was significantly lower in group S ( @ @ vs. @ @ IUL ( -@ ) ; p = @ ) .
Result	On multivariate analysis , use of the modified cardioplegia and aortic crossclamp time were significantly associated with creatine kinase-MB level and reperfusion time after declamping .
Conclusion	This modified technique was an acceptable option that provided a bloodless operative field and avoided multiple cardioplegic administrations .

Background	Vitamin D repletion with high doses of vitamin D is often recommended to patients and healthy subjects .
Background	The safety , especially concerning changes in urinary calcium excretion is of great importance .
Method	In a double-blinded , placebo-controlled study in @ healthy volunteers , we examined the changes in mineral metabolism during supplementation with @ IU of oral cholecalciferol daily during @ months .
Result	Both @ ( OH ) vitamin D and @,@ ( OH ) @vitamin D increased significantly in the active treated group as compared to the placebo group ( @ % versus @ % ( P < @ ) and @ % versus -@ % ( P < @ ) ) .
Result	No change was observed in urinary calcium excretion in the active group compared to the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Fibroblast growth factor @ increased significantly by @ % ( P < @ ) in the active group .
Result	However , there was no difference in changes in FGF@ between treatment groups ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	High dose cholecalciferol significantly increases @ ( OH ) vitamin D and @,@ ( OH ) @vitamin D levels compared to placebo .
Conclusion	No changes in urinary calcium excretion or other measured components of the mineral metabolism were found between groups .

Background	Laboratory skills training is now required for general surgery residents .
Background	The optimal method of teaching vascular anastomosis ( VA ) is not well defined .
Background	Teaching VA skills one-on-one with a faculty instructor will result in a more rapid accumulation of skills than teaching in a large group setting .
Method	Residents were shown an instructional video on how to perform a VA using a standardized model ( cadaver saphenous vein and porcine aorta ) .
Method	Each resident then performed a baseline VA. .
Method	Sixteen first - and second-year surgical residents were then randomized to @ VA teaching sessions that consisted of either @ ) group teaching ( GT , @ residents in a room with @ faculty instructor circulating ) or @ ) one-on-one teaching ( @-on-@ , faculty member focused on individual resident ) .
Method	After each of these sessions , residents performed a standardized VA. .
Method	The anastomoses were video recorded .
Method	Performance was evaluated using a standardized scoring system by a separate expert who viewed the video recordings in a blinded fashion .
Method	Outcome measures included total errors , total time , global rating scale , and an anastomosis-specific end-product evaluation ( leak and passage of coronary dilator ) .
Result	Overall , significant decreases in total errors ( @ to @ , P = @ ) and time to complete anastomoses ( @ to @ min , P = @ ) and an increase in global rating scales ( @ to @ , P = @ ) were noted in both groups from baseline after @ VA teaching session .
Result	The @-on-@ group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in terms of reduced anastomotic time ( @ vs. @ min , P = @ ) and in reduction of errors ( @ vs. @ errors , P = @ ) than the GT group .
Conclusion	The high-fidelity VA model is a useful tool for junior general surgery residents .
Conclusion	Both GT and @-on-@ groups demonstrated significant improvement in total errors and time after only @ sessions .
Conclusion	Greater improvement was noted using the @-on-@ model .

Background	Oxidative stress and inflammation during cardiac surgery may be associated with acute renal injury ( ARI ) .
Background	N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) and carvedilol have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .
Problem	A combination of carvedilol and NAC should decrease the incidence of ARI more than metoprolol or carvedilol .
Method	Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to metoprolol , carvedilol , or carvedilol plus NAC .
Method	End points were occurrence of ARI and change in preoperative to postoperative peak creatinine levels .
Result	ARI incidence was lower in the carvedilol plus NAC group compared with the metoprolol ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) or carvedilol ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) groups , but was similar between the metoprolol and carvedilol groups ( P = @ ) .
Result	Preoperative and postoperative day @ creatinine levels were similar among the metoprolol ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) the carvedilol ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) and the carvedilol plus NAC groups ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mg/dL ; all P values > @ ) .
Result	Postoperative day @ , day @ , and peak creatinine levels were lower in the carvedilol plus NAC group ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) as compared with the metoprolol ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) or carvedilol groups ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- and @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mg/dL ; all P values < @ ) , but were similar between the metoprolol and carvedilol groups ( all P values > @ ) .
Conclusion	Combined carvedilol and NAC decreased ARI incidence as compared with carvedilol or metoprolol .
Conclusion	No difference was detected between carvedilol and metoprolol .

Background	It is thought that therapy should be functional , be highly repetitive , and promote afferent input to best stimulate hand motor recovery after stroke , yet patients struggle to access such therapy .
Background	We developed the MusicGlove , an instrumented glove that requires the user to practice gripping-like movements and thumb-finger opposition to play a highly engaging , music-based , video game .
Background	The purpose of this study was to @ ) compare the effect of training with MusicGlove to conventional hand therapy @ ) determine if MusicGlove training was more effective than a matched form of isometric hand movement training ; and @ ) determine if MusicGlove game scores predict clinical outcomes .
Method	@ chronic stroke survivors with moderate hemiparesis were randomly assigned to receive MusicGlove , isometric , and conventional hand therapy in a within-subjects design .
Method	Each subject participated in six one-hour treatment sessions three times per week for two weeks , for each training type , for a total of @ treatment sessions .
Method	A blinded rater assessed hand impairment before and after each training type and at one-month follow-up including the Box and Blocks ( B & B ) test as the primary outcome measure .
Method	Subjects also completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) .
Result	Subjects improved hand function related to grasping small objects more after MusicGlove compared to conventional training , as measured by the B & B score ( improvement of @ vs. -@ blocks ; P = @ ) and the @ Hole Peg test ( improvement of @ vs. -@ pegs/minute ; P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant difference between training types in the broader assessment batteries of hand function .
Result	Subjects benefited less from isometric therapy than MusicGlove training , but the difference was not significant ( P > @ ) .
Result	Subjects sustained improvements in hand function at a one month follow-up , and found the MusicGlove more motivating than the other two therapies , as measured by the IMI .
Result	MusicGlove games scores correlated strongly with the B & B score .
Conclusion	These results support the hypothesis that hand therapy that is engaging , incorporates high numbers of repetitions of gripping and thumb-finger opposition movements , and promotes afferent input is a promising approach to improving an individual 's ability to manipulate small objects .
Conclusion	The MusicGlove provides a simple way to access such therapy .

Background	There is evidence that neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) burden is associated with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .
Background	However , it is not clear whether this association is direct or mediated through the increased cognitive impairment associated with NFTs .
Method	We sought to determine whether the extended MAPT haplotype was associated with the worsening of delusions and hallucinations in a combined cohort of @ patients who participated in @ clinical trials of treatment with memantine .
Result	After controlling for baseline dementia severity , exposure to memantine , and antipsychotics , analysis shows that carriers of at least one H@ allele had a @-fold ( P = @ ) increased risk of worsening hallucinations .
Result	There was some evidence of association with worsening delusions but only in analysis by allele .
Conclusion	These results are the first to indicate that the H@ allele of the extended MAPT haplotype negatively affects the course of psychotic symptoms in AD independently of disease severity .
Conclusion	It will be important for future research to examine MAPT transcription in people with AD with and without psychotic symptoms to understand the exact mechanisms underlying these findings .

Background	Previous efforts such as Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders ( ACOVE ) provide quality indicators for assessing the care of elderly patients , but thus far little has been done to leverage this knowledge to improve care for these patients .
Background	We describe a clinical decision support system to improve general practitioner ( GP ) adherence to ACOVE quality indicators and a protocol for investigating impact on GPs ' adherence to the rules .
Method	We propose two randomized controlled trials among a group of Dutch GP teams on adherence to ACOVE quality indicators .
Method	In both trials a clinical decision support system provides un-intrusive feedback appearing as a color-coded , dynamically updated , list of items needing attention .
Method	The first trial pertains to real-time automatically verifiable rules .
Method	The second trial concerns non-automatically verifiable rules ( adherence can not be established by the clinical decision support system itself , but the GPs report whether they will adhere to the rules ) .
Method	In both trials we will randomize teams of GPs caring for the same patients into two groups , A and B. For the automatically verifiable rules , group A GPs receive support only for a specific inter-related subset of rules , and group B GPs receive support only for the remainder of the rules .
Method	For non-automatically verifiable rules , group A GPs receive feedback framed as actions with positive consequences , and group B GPs receive feedback framed as inaction with negative consequences .
Method	GPs indicate whether they adhere to non-automatically verifiable rules .
Method	In both trials , the main outcome measure is mean adherence , automatically derived or self-reported , to the rules .
Conclusion	We relied on active end-user involvement in selecting the rules to support , and on a model for providing feedback displayed as color-coded real-time messages concerning the patient visiting the GP at that time , without interrupting the GP 's workflow with pop-ups .
Conclusion	While these aspects are believed to increase clinical decision support system acceptance and its impact on adherence to the selected clinical rules , systems with these properties have not yet been evaluated .

Problem	To examine the comparative antidepressant efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine ( SAMe ) and escitalopram in a placebo-controlled , randomized , double-blind clinical trial .
Method	One hundred eighty-nine outpatients ( @ % female , mean -LSB- SD -RSB- age = @ -LSB- @ -RSB- years ) with DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive disorder ( MDD ) were recruited from April @ , @ , to December @ , @ , at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Butler Hospital .
Method	Patients were randomized for @ weeks to SAMe @,@-@ ,@ mg/d , escitalopram @-@ mg/d , or placebo .
Method	Doses were escalated at @ weeks in the event of nonresponse .
Method	The main outcome measure was the @-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-@ ) .
Method	Tolerability was assessed by the Systematic Assessment for Treatment of Emergent Events-Specific Inquiry ( SAFTEE-SI ) .
Result	All @ treatment arms demonstrated a significant improvement of about @-@ points in HDRS-@ scores ( P < @ for all ) , and no significant differences were observed between the treatment arms ( P > @ for all ) .
Result	Response rates in the intent-to-treat sample were @ % for SAMe , @ % for escitalopram , and @ % for placebo .
Result	Remission rates were @ % for SAMe , @ % for escitalopram , and @ % for placebo .
Result	No comparisons between treatment groups attained significance ( P > @ for all ) .
Result	Tolerability was good , with gastrointestinal side effects ( @ % for stomach discomfort and @ % for diarrhea ) as the most common in the SAMe arm .
Result	Significant differences were observed between treatment groups for dizziness , anorgasmia , diminished mental acuity , and hot flashes ( P < @ for all ) .
Conclusion	The results fail to support an advantage over placebo for either the investigational treatment SAMe or the standard treatment escitalopram for MDD .

Background	Increased left ventricular ( LV ) size is associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity .
Background	Once non-contrast cardiac computed tomography ( CT ) is performed for other purposes , information of LV size is readily available .
Problem	To determine the association of gated CT-derived LV size with cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) and to describe age - and gender-specific normative values in a general population cohort .
Method	LV area was quantified from non-contrast-enhanced CT in axial , end-diastolic images at a mid-ventricular slice in participants of the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study , free of known cardiovascular disease .
Method	LV index ( LVI ) was calculated by the quotient of LV area and body surface area ( BSA ) .
Method	Crude and adjusted regression analyses were used to determine the association of LVI with risk factors and CAC .
Result	Overall , @ subjects ( age @ @ years , @ % women ) were included in this analysis .
Result	From quantification in end-diastolic phase , men had larger LV index ( @ @ mm ( @ ) / m ( @ ) vs. @ @ mm ( @ ) / m ( @ ) , both P < @ ) .
Result	LVI was strongly correlated systolic blood pressure ( men , PE -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- : @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mm ( @ ) / @ mmHg ; women , @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- ) , and antihypertensive medication ( men , @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mm ( @ ) ; women : @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , all P < @ ) .
Result	Cholesterol levels were associated with LVI in univariate analysis , however , correlations were low ( R ( @ ) @ ) .
Result	In multivariable regression , blood pressure , antihypertensive medication and cholesterol levels , remained associated with LVI ( P < @ ) .
Result	LVI was linked with CAC in unadjusted ( men , increase of CAC + @ by @ % -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- with increased LVI by @ standard deviation of LVI , P = @ ; women , @ % -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , P < @ ) and risk factor adjusted models ( men , @ % -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , P = @ ) ; women , @ % -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Non-contrast cardiac CT derived LV index is associated with body size and hypertension .
Conclusion	LVI is weakly linked with CAC-score .
Conclusion	Further studies need to evaluate whether assessment of LV dimensions from cardiac CT helps identifying subjects with increased cardiovascular risk .

Background	Evidence from armed conflict settings points to high levels of intimate partner violence ( IPV ) against women .
Background	Current knowledge on how to prevent IPV is limited-especially within war-affected settings .
Background	To inform prevention programming on gender-based violence in settings affected by conflict , we evaluated the impact of adding a targeted men 's intervention to a community-based prevention programme in Cte d'Ivoire .
Method	We conducted a two-armed , non-blinded cluster randomized trial in Cte d'Ivoire among @ pair-matched communities spanning government-controlled , UN buffer , and rebel-controlled zones .
Method	The intervention communities received a @-week IPV prevention intervention using a men 's discussion group format .
Method	All communities received community-based prevention programmes .
Method	Baseline data were collected from couples in September @ ( pre-intervention ) and follow-up in March @ ( one year post-intervention ) .
Method	The primary trial outcome was women 's reported experiences of physical and/or sexual IPV in the last @ months .
Method	We also assessed men 's reported intention to use physical IPV , attitudes towards sexual IPV , use of hostility and conflict management skills , and participation in gendered household tasks .
Method	An adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis was used to compare outcomes between intervention and control communities at follow-up .
Result	At follow-up , reported levels of physical and/or sexual IPV in the intervention arm had decreased compared to the control arm ( ARR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , not significant ) .
Result	Men participating in the intervention reported decreased intentions to use physical IPV ( ARR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) and improved attitudes toward sexual IPV ( ARR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	Significant differences were found between men in the intervention and control arms ' reported ability to control their hostility and manage conflict ( ARR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and participation in gendered household tasks ( ARR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	This trial points to the value of adding interventions working with men alongside community activities to reduce levels of IPV in conflict-affected settings .
Conclusion	The intervention significantly influenced men 's reported behaviours related to hostility and conflict management and gender equitable behaviours .
Conclusion	The decreased mean level of IPV and the differences between intervention and control arms , while not statistically significant , suggest that IPV in conflict-affected areas can be reduced through concerted efforts to include men directly in violence prevention programming .
Conclusion	A larger-scale trial is needed to replicate these findings and further understand the mechanisms of change .

Background	Postoperative ileus ( POI ) is a common complication following colorectal surgery that delays recovery and increases length of hospital stay .
Background	Gum chewing may reduce POI and therefore enhance recovery after surgery .
Background	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of gum chewing on POI , length of hospital stay and inflammatory parameters .
Method	Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery in one of two centres were randomized to either chewing gum or a dermal patch ( control ) .
Method	Chewing gum was started before surgery and stopped when oral intake was resumed .
Method	Primary endpoints were POI and length of stay .
Method	Secondary endpoints were systemic and local inflammation , and surgical complications .
Method	Gastric emptying was measured by ultrasonography .
Method	Soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor @ ( TNFRSF@A ) and interleukin ( IL ) @ levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Result	Between May @ and September @ , @ patients were randomized to chewing gum ( @ ) or dermal patch ( control group ; @ ) .
Result	Mean ( s.d. ) length of hospital stay was shorter in the chewing gum group than in controls , but this difference was not significant : @ ( @ ) versus @ ( @ ) days respectively .
Result	Some @ ( @ per cent ) of @ analysed patients allocated to chewing gum developed POI compared with @ ( @ per cent ) of @ patients in the control group ( P = @ ) .
Result	More patients in the chewing gum group first defaecated within @ days of surgery ( @ versus @ per cent ; P = @ ) and passed first flatus within @h ( @ versus @ per cent ; P = @ ) .
Result	The decrease in antral area measured by ultrasonography following a standard meal was significantly greater among patients who chewed gum : median @ ( range -@ to @ ) per cent compared with @ ( range -@ to @ ) per cent in controls ( P = @ ) .
Result	Levels of IL-@ ( @ versus @pg/ml ; P = @ ) and TNFRSF@A ( @ versus @ng/ml ; P = @ ) were lower among patients in the chewing gum group .
Result	Fewer patients in this group developed a grade IIIb complication ( @ of @ versus @ of @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Gum chewing is a safe and simple treatment to reduce POI , and is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers and complications .

Problem	To assess the relative impact of an intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) on use and costs of health care within the Look AHEAD trial .
Method	A total of @,@ overweight or obese adults with type @ diabetes were randomly assigned to an ILI that promoted weight loss or to a comparison condition of diabetes support and education ( DSE ) .
Method	Use and costs of health-care services were recorded across an average of @ years .
Result	ILI led to reductions in annual hospitalizations ( @ % , P = @ ) , hospital days ( @ % , P = @ ) , and number of medications ( @ % , P < @ ) , resulting in cost savings for hospitalization ( @ % , P = @ ) and medication ( @ % , P < @ ) .
Result	ILI produced a mean relative per-person @-year cost savings of $ @,@ ( @ % CI @,@-@ ,@ ) ; however , these were not evident among individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease .
Conclusion	Compared with DSE over @ years , ILI participants had fewer hospitalizations , fewer medications , and lower health-care costs .

Background	Prolonged ventilation and failed extubation are associated with increased harm and cost .
Background	The added value of heart and respiratory rate variability ( HRV and RRV ) during spontaneous breathing trials ( SBTs ) to predict extubation failure remains unknown .
Method	We enrolled @ patients in a multicenter ( @ sites ) , prospective , observational study , evaluating clinical estimates of risk of extubation failure , physiologic measures recorded during SBTs , HRV and RRV recorded before and during the last SBT prior to extubation , and extubation outcomes .
Method	We excluded @ patients because of protocol or technical violations , or poor data quality .
Method	Measures of variability ( @ HRV , @ RRV ) were calculated from electrocardiogram and capnography waveforms followed by automated cleaning and variability analysis using Continuous Individualized Multiorgan Variability Analysis ( CIMVA ) software .
Method	Repeated randomized subsampling with training , validation , and testing were used to derive and compare predictive models .
Result	Of @ patients with high-quality data , @ ( @ % ) failed extubation .
Result	Two HRV and eight RRV measures showed statistically significant association with extubation failure ( P < @ , @ % false discovery rate ) .
Result	An ensemble average of five univariate logistic regression models using RRV during SBT , yielding a probability of extubation failure ( called WAVE score ) , demonstrated optimal predictive capacity .
Result	With repeated random subsampling and testing , the model showed mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve ( ROC AUC ) of @ , higher than heart rate ( @ ) , rapid shallow breathing index ( RBSI ; @ ) and respiratory rate ( @ ) .
Result	After deriving a WAVE model based on all data , training-set performance demonstrated that the model increased its predictive power when applied to patients conventionally considered high risk : a WAVE score > @ in patients with RSBI > @ and perceived high risk of failure yielded a fold increase in risk of extubation failure of @ ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @ to @ ) and @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) , respectively .
Conclusion	Altered HRV and RRV ( during the SBT prior to extubation ) are significantly associated with extubation failure .
Conclusion	A predictive model using RRV during the last SBT provided optimal accuracy of prediction in all patients , with improved accuracy when combined with clinical impression or RSBI .
Conclusion	This model requires a validation cohort to evaluate accuracy and generalizability .

Problem	- blockers are the standard treatment for myocardial infarction ( MI ) based on evidence from the pre-thrombolytic era .
Problem	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of - blocker treatment in patients with acute MI and preserved systolic function in the era of percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
Method	We analysed a multicentre registry and identified @ patients who presented with acute MI between @ and @ .
Method	Patients were treated with PCI , had left ventricular EFs @ % according to echocardiograms that were performed during the index PCI , and were alive at the time of discharge .
Method	The association between - blocker use after discharge and mortality ( all-cause death and cardiac death ) within @ years was examined .
Result	Patients who were not treated with - blockers ( n = @ ) showed higher rates of all-cause death and cardiac death compared to patients treated with - blockers ( @ % vs @ % , p < @ , @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) .
Result	The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that - blocker treatment was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause death ( adjusted HR @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) and cardiac death ( adjusted HR @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p < @ ) .
Result	Comparable results were obtained after propensity score matching .
Conclusion	- blocker treatment was associated with reduced long term mortality in patients with acute MI and preserved systolic function who received PCI .

Background	Topical corticosteroids are the most common first-line treatment for psoriasis .
Background	Tachyphylaxis , a decreased response to treatment with repetitive application of the drug , is a controversial phenomenon associated with topical corticosteroid treatment .
Problem	We sought to prove or disprove tachyphylaxis to occluded halobetasol @ % versus vehicle .
Method	Patients with plaque psoriasis were recruited to this study .
Method	The study involved @ phases ( @ , @A , and @B ) with each phase being separated by a treatment vacation period .
Method	In phases @ and @A , @ plaques were randomized to either halobetasol @ % or vehicle ointment application .
Method	In phase @B , halobetasol @ % was applied to both .
Method	Target Lesion Severity Scale was used for clinical assessment .
Result	Twenty patients were enrolled .
Result	No difference in time to clearance ( P = @ ) or time to recurrence ( P = @ ) of the treated plaques was found between phases @ and @A .
Result	Percentage of improvement was higher in phase @A compared with phase @ ( @ % , P < @ vs @ % , P < @ ) , as a result of reduction of vehicle effect .
Result	In phase @B , a greater improvement was found for previously corticosteroid-treated plaques .
Conclusion	Limitations are small sample size and @ corticosteroid tested .
Conclusion	No evidence of tachyphylaxis to the topical corticosteroid halobetasol @ % ointment treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis was found .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of deep dry needling ( DDN ) on spasticity , pressure sensitivity , and plantar pressure in patients who have had stroke .
Method	A randomized controlled trial was conducted .
Method	Thirty-four patients who previously had a stroke were randomly assigned either an experimental group that received a single session of DDN over the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles on the spastic leg or a control group that received no intervention .
Method	Spasticity ( evaluated with the Ashworth Scale ) ; pressure pain thresholds over the deltoid muscle , second metacarpal , and tibialis anterior muscle ; and plantar pressure ( baropodometry ) were collected by a blinded assessor before and @ minutes after intervention .
Result	A greater number of individuals receiving DDN exhibited decreased spasticity after the intervention ( P < @ ) .
Result	The analysis of covariance showed that pressure pain thresholds increased bilaterally in patients receiving DDN compared with those who did not receive the intervention ( P < @ ) .
Result	The analysis of covariance also found that patients receiving DDN experienced bilateral increases of support surface in the forefoot , unilateral increase of the support surface in the rear foot of the treated ( affected ) side , and bilateral decreases in mean pressure ( all , P < @ ) as compared with those who did not receive DDN .
Conclusion	Our results suggest that a single session of DDN decreases spasticity and widespread pressure sensitivity in individuals with poststroke spasticity .
Conclusion	Deep dry needling also induced changes in plantar pressure by increasing the support surface and decreasing the mean pressure .

Background	The most important action in the resuscitation of a newborn in the delivery room is to establish effective assisted ventilation .
Background	The face mask and endotracheal tube are the devices used to achieve this goal .
Background	Laryngeal mask airways that fit over the laryngeal inlet have been shown to be effective for ventilating newborns at birth and should be considered as an alternative to facemask ventilation or endotracheal intubation among newborns weighing > @,@ g or delivered @weeks ' gestation .
Background	A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of supraglottic airways in neonatal resuscitation reported the results of four randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) stating that fewer infants in the group using laryngeal mask airways required endotracheal intubation ( @ % ) compared to the group using face masks ( @ % ) .
Background	However , there were methodological concerns over all the RCTs including the fact that the majority of the operators in the trials were anesthesiologists.Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that ventilating newborns needing positive pressure ventilation with a laryngeal mask airway will be more effective than ventilating with a face mask in a setting where neonatal resuscitation is performed by midwives , nurses , and pediatricians .
Background	The primary aim of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of the laryngeal mask airway over the face mask in preventing the need for endotracheal intubation .
Method	This will be an open , prospective , randomized , single center , clinical trial .
Method	In this study , @ newborns weighing > @,@ g or delivered @weeks gestation needing positive pressure ventilation at birth will be randomized to be ventilated with a laryngeal mask airway ( LMA SupremeTM , LMA Company , UK - intervention group ) or with a face mask ( control group ) .
Method	Proportion of newborns needing endotracheal intubation .
Result	Apgar score at @minutes , time to first breath , onset of the first cry , duration of resuscitation , death or moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy within @days of life .

Background	Sugar overconsumption and chronic stress are growing health concerns because they both may increase the risk for obesity and its related diseases .
Background	Rodent studies suggest that sugar consumption may activate a glucocorticoid-metabolic-brain-negative feedback pathway , which may turn off the stress response and thereby reinforce habitual sugar overconsumption .
Problem	The objective of the study was to test our hypothesized glucocorticoid-metabolic-brain model in women consuming beverages sweetened with either aspartame of sucrose .
Method	This was a parallel-arm , double-masked diet intervention study .
Method	The study was conducted at the University of California , Davis , Clinical and Translational Science Center 's Clinical Research Center and the University of California , Davis , Medical Center Imaging Research Center .
Method	Nineteen women ( age range @-@ y ) with a body mass index ( range @-@ kg/m ( @ ) ) who were a subgroup from a National Institutes of Health-funded investigation of @ participants assigned to eight experimental groups .
Method	The intervention consisted of sucrose - or aspartame-sweetened beverage consumption three times per day for @ weeks .
Method	Salivary cortisol and regional brain responses to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task were measured .
Result	Compared with aspartame , sucrose consumption was associated with significantly higher activity in the left hippocampus ( P = @ ) .
Result	Sucrose , but not aspartame , consumption associated with reduced ( P = @ ) stress-induced cortisol .
Result	The sucrose group also had a lower reactivity to naltrexone , significantly ( P = @ ) lower nausea , and a trend ( P = @ ) toward lower cortisol .
Conclusion	These experimental findings support a metabolic-brain-negative feedback pathway that is affected by sugar and may make some people under stress more hooked on sugar and possibly more vulnerable to obesity and its related conditions .

Background	Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and the underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood , and their presence and intensity are related to known cardiovascular disease risk factors .
Background	Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce subsequent risk of CVD .
Problem	The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies facilitating adoption of the National , Heart , Lung and Blood Institute supported Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents .
Problem	This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index , blood pressure , and tobacco using two strategies : a multifaceted , practice-directed intervention versus standard dissemination .
Method	Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations .
Method	Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation , number of clinicians per practice , urban versus nonurban location , and practice type .
Method	The units of observation are individual children because measure adherence is abstracted from individual patient 's medical records .
Method	The units of randomization are physician practices .
Method	This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices .
Method	The intervention practices received toolkits and supported guideline implementation including academic detailing , an ongoing e-learning group .
Method	This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements including monthly physician self-abstraction , webinars , and other elements of the trial .
Conclusion	This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to enhance CV prevention in children by guideline-based interventions .

Background	In adults with Williams-Beuren syndrome ( WBS ) , a common endocrine abnormality is type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) or impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) .
Background	However , few and sporadic data are available in children , adolescents , and young adults with WBS .
Problem	To evaluate the frequency of IGT and T@DM in a cohort of children and young patients with WBS .
Method	We longitudinally evaluated @ patients ( @ males and @ females , median age at study onset @ years ) with WBS .
Method	The median follow-up was @ years .
Method	Variables of insulin resistance and - cell function were evaluated in all subjects using an oral glucose tolerance test .
Method	The homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) of insulin resistance and the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity were calculated .
Method	The study of the GCK and HNF@ genes was performed in patients with glucose metabolism abnormalities .
Method	@ age - and sex-matched healthy subjects and @ age - , sex - and BMI-matched subjects were recruited as two control groups .
Result	Considering nutritional status , @ ( @ % ) patients were obese , @ ( @ % ) overweight , and @ ( @ % ) normal-weight .
Result	One ( @ % ) patient had acanthosis nigricans .
Result	IGT was diagnosed in @ ( @ % ) WBS patients and T@DM in @ ( @ % ) .
Result	Considering all WBS patients , the median value of HOMA was @ ( range @-@ @ ; insulin @ @ U/ml ; glucose @ @ mg/dl ) .
Result	Considering BMI values , HOMA was @ ( range @-@ @ ) , @ ( range @-@ @ ) , and @ ( range @-@ @ ) , and insulin was @ @ , @ @ , and @ @ U/ml in obese , overweight , and normal-weight WBS patients , respectively .
Result	Comparing the results with the two control groups , WBS patients showed higher insulin values than healthy controls ( p < @ ) , but similar values as the BMI-matched control group ( p = n.s. ) .
Result	However , WBS patients showed significantly higher values of glycemia ( healthy control group , p < @ ; BMI-matched control group , p < @ ) and HOMA ( healthy control group , p < @ ; BMI-matched control group , p < @ ) than the two control groups .
Result	Finally , among WBS patients there was a higher number of subjects with IGT and T@DM than among healthy controls ( p < @ ) and the BMI-matched control group ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Our data strongly suggest that IGT and T@DM may be frequently discovered in children , adolescents , and young adults with WBS .
Conclusion	WBS should be included among the genetic syndromes associated with T@DM .
Conclusion	Further studies are necessary to evaluate the etiopathogenesis of this aspect .

Problem	The aim of this study was to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and exposure-response relationship of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .
Method	Concentration data from @,@ subjects in @ clinical studies ( eight phase I , one phase II , and two phase III ) were used to perform a population PK analysis , including estimation of the bioavailability and quantification of the effects of P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitors as well as renal impairment on edoxaban PK .
Method	The potential relationship between edoxaban PK exposure and incidence of bleeding events was explored based on data from @ AF patients .
Result	Absolute bioavailability of edoxaban was estimated as @ % .
Result	With oral dosing of edoxaban , co-administration of various P-gp inhibitors significantly increased edoxaban bioavailability and decreased volume of distribution ( V @ ) , resulting in a predicted increase of @-@ % in area under the curve ( AUC ) and @-@ % in C max .
Result	A much smaller increase was seen in edoxaban concentration at @ h post-dose ( C @ , -@ to @ % ) , due to decreased V @ and shortened elimination half-life .
Result	With IV dosing of edoxaban , co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine decreased both edoxaban clearance ( CL ) and V @ , resulting in an increase of @ % in AUC and @ % in C @ .
Result	Creatinine clearance was a significant covariate on renal clearance , whereas age and body weight significantly affected nonrenal clearance .
Result	Model-predicted steady state C min was slightly higher , but AUC was comparable for patients who had severe renal impairment and received edoxaban @ mg once daily ( QD ) versus patients who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment and received edoxaban @ mg QD .
Result	Exposure-response analysis suggested that edoxaban C min and country/region are significantly associated with the incidence of bleeds .
Conclusion	The model provided reasonable estimation with regard to the absolute bioavailability of edoxaban , the magnitude of change in edoxaban exposure upon co-administration of P-gp inhibitors , and the impact of renal impairment on edoxaban clearance .
Conclusion	Analysis results supported a @ % dose reduction scheme for subjects with severe renal impairment .
Conclusion	Further confirmation will be sought by incorporating clinical safety and efficacy information from larger phase III trials .

Background	Cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) concentrations are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome in primary prevention populations .
Background	Whether statin therapy modifies this association is poorly understood .
Result	We measured high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I ( hsTnI ) in @ and BNP in @ participants without cardiovascular disease in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention : An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ( JUPITER ) trial before randomization to rosuvastatin @ mg/d or placebo .
Result	Nearly @ % of participants had detectable circulating hsTnI , and @ % of men and @ % of women had levels above proposed sex-specific reference limits of @ and @ ng/L , respectively .
Result	hsTnI concentrations in the highest tertile were associated with a first major cardiovascular event ( adjusted hazard ratio -LSB- aHR -RSB- , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P for trend < @ ) .
Result	BNP levels in the highest tertile were also associated a first cardiovascular event ( aHR , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P for trend < @ ) .
Result	The risk of all-cause mortality was elevated for the highest versus the lowest tertiles of hsTnI ( aHR , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P for trend < @ ) and BNP ( aHR , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P for trend @ ) .
Result	Rosuvastatin was equally effective in preventing a first cardiovascular event across categories of hsTnI ( aHR range , @-@ @ ) and BNP ( aHR range , @-@ @ ) with no statistically significant evidence of interaction ( P for interaction = @ and @ , respectively ) .
Conclusion	In a contemporary primary prevention population , baseline cardiac troponin I and BNP were associated with the risk of vascular events and all-cause mortality .
Conclusion	The benefits of rosuvastatin were substantial and consistent regardless of baseline hsTnI or BNP concentrations .

Background	Experimental evidence suggests that the inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane has a cardioprotective effect .
Background	Our objective was to determine if sedation with sevoflurane will reduce infarct size in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) who are treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
Method	We randomized @ patients presenting with a first acute ST-elevation MI treated by primary PCI within @ hours from symptom onset to sedation with sevoflurane inhalation or standard sedation ( control ) .
Method	Coronary flow at the end of PCI was assessed by corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count .
Method	Myocardial reperfusion was assessed by ST-segment resolution @ minutes post-PCI .
Method	Infarct size was assessed by release of creatinine kinase ( CK ) and troponin T.
Result	There was no difference in the primary end point : troponin T or CK release adjusted to the area at risk , between groups .
Result	However , among patients with anterior MI , there was a trend toward lower CK ( P = @ ) and nonsignificant decrease in troponin ( P = @ ) levels in the sevoflurane group .
Result	Corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count was @ @ in the sevoflurane group and @ @ in the control group ( P = @ ) .
Result	There was more ST resolution in patients treated by sevoflurane @ % @ % versus @ % @ % ( P = @ ) .
Result	Sevoflurane had no significant adverse effect during administration .
Conclusion	Sevoflurane administration during primary PCI did not reduce infarct size .
Conclusion	There was a trend toward a reduction in infarct size among patients with anterior MI .
Conclusion	Sevoflurane administration was associated with improvement in ST-segment resolution .

Background	Little is known about the effect of specific anti-interleukin-@ therapy , as compared with established anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies , for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis .
Method	In a @-week , phase @ , dose-ranging , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , active-comparator trial , we compared guselkumab ( CNTO @ ) , an anti-interleukin-@ monoclonal antibody , with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis .
Method	A total of @ patients were randomly assigned to receive guselkumab ( @ mg at weeks @ and @ and every @ weeks thereafter , @ mg every @ weeks , @ mg at weeks @ and @ and every @ weeks thereafter , @ mg every @ weeks , or @ mg at weeks @ and @ and every @ weeks thereafter ) through week @ , placebo , or adalimumab ( standard dosage for psoriasis ) .
Method	At week @ , patients in the placebo group crossed over to receive guselkumab at a dose of @ mg every @ weeks .
Method	The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) score of @ ( indicating cleared psoriasis ) or @ ( indicating minimal psoriasis ) at week @ .
Result	At week @ , the proportion of patients with a PGA score of @ or @ was significantly higher in each guselkumab group than in the placebo group : @ % in the @-mg group , @ % in the @-mg group , @ % in the @-mg group , @ % in the @-mg group , and @ % in the @-mg group , as compared with @ % in the placebo group ( P@ @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	Moreover , the proportion was significantly higher in the @-mg , @-mg , and @-mg guselkumab groups than in the adalimumab group ( @ % ) ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	At week @ , the proportion of patients with at least a @ % improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores was significantly higher in each guselkumab group than in the placebo group ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	At week @ , the proportion of patients with a PGA score of @ or @ remained significantly higher in the @-mg , @-mg , and @-mg guselkumab groups than in the adalimumab group ( @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively , vs. @ % ) ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	Between week @ and week @ , infections were observed in @ % of the patients in the guselkumab groups , @ % in the adalimumab group , and @ % in the placebo group .
Conclusion	The results of this phase @ trial suggest that guselkumab may be an effective therapy for plaque psoriasis and that control of psoriasis can be achieved with specific anti-interleukin-@ therapy .

Problem	Patients with CKD have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease associated with or exacerbated by inactivity .
Problem	This randomized , controlled study investigated whether a renal rehabilitation exercise program for patients with stages @ or @ CKD would improve their physical function and quality of life .
Method	In total , @ adults with CKD stages @ and @ were randomized , and @ of these patients proceeded to usual care or the renal rehabilitation exercise intervention consisting of usual care plus guided exercise two times per week for @ weeks ( @ sessions ) .
Method	Physical function was determined by three well established performance-based tests : @-minute walk test , sit-to-stand test , and gait-speed test .
Method	Health-related quality of life was assessed by the RAND @-Item Short Form Health Survey .
Result	At baseline , no differences in self-reported level of activity , @-minute walk test , and sit-to-stand test scores were observed between the usual care ( n = @ ) and renal rehabilitation exercise ( n = @ ) groups , although baseline gait-speed test score was higher in the renal rehabilitation exercise group ( P < @ ) .
Result	At follow-up , the renal rehabilitation exercise group but not the usual care group showed significant improvements in the @-minute walk test ( +@ ft -LSB- @ % improvement -RSB- versus -@ ft ; P < @ ) , the sit-to-stand test ( +@ % of age prediction -LSB- @ % improvement -RSB- versus +@ % of age prediction ; P < @ ) , and the RAND-@ physical measures of role functioning ( P < @ ) , physical functioning ( P < @ ) , energy/fatigue levels ( P = @ ) , and general health ( P = @ ) and mental measure of pain scale ( P = @ ) .
Result	The renal rehabilitation exercise regimen was generally well tolerated .
Conclusion	A @-week/@-session renal rehabilitation exercise program improved physical capacity and quality of life in patients with CKD stages @ and @ .
Conclusion	Longer follow-up is needed to determine if these findings will translate into decreased mortality rates .

Background	Despite scientific advances in typing of C. difficile strains very little is known about how hospital staff use typing results during periods of increased incidence ( PIIs ) .
Background	This qualitative study , undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) , explored this issue .
Background	The trial compared ribotyping versus more rapid genotyping ( MLVA or multilocus variable repeat analysis ) and found no significant difference in post @ hour cases ( C difficile transmissions ) .
Method	In-depth qualitative interviews with senior staff in @/@ hospital trusts in the trial ( @ MLVA and @ Ribotyping ) .
Method	Semi-structured interviews were conducted at end of the trial period .
Method	Transcripts were content analysed using framework analysis supported by NVivo-@ software .
Method	Common sub-themes were extracted by two researchers independently .
Method	These were compared and organised into over-arching categories or ` super-ordinate themes ' .
Result	The trial recorded that @ % of typing tests had some impact on infection control ( IC ) activities .
Result	Interviews indicated that tests had little impact on initial IC decisions .
Result	These were driven by hospital protocols and automatically triggered when a PII was identified .
Result	To influence decision-making , a laboratory turnaround time < @ days ( ideally @ hours ) was suggested ; MLVA turnaround time was @ days .
Result	Typing results were predominantly used to modify initiated IC activities such as ward cleaning , audits of practice or staff training ; major decisions ( e.g. ward closure ) were unaffected .
Result	Organisational factors could limit utilisation of MLVA results .
Result	Results were twice as likely to be reported as ` aiding management ' ( indirect benefit ) than impacting on IC activities ( direct effect ) .
Result	Some interviewees considered test results provided reassurance about earlier IC decisions ; others identified secondary benefits on organisational culture .
Result	An underlying benefit of improved discrimination provided by MLVA typing was the ability to explore epidemiology associated with CDI cases in a hospital more thoroughly .
Conclusion	Ribotyping and MLVA are both valued by users .
Conclusion	MLVA had little additional direct impact on initial infection control decisions .
Conclusion	This would require reduced turnaround time .
Conclusion	The major impact is adjustments to earlier IC measures and retrospective reassurance .
Conclusion	For this , turnaround time is less important than discriminatory power .
Conclusion	The potential remains for wider use of genotyping to examine transmission routes .

Problem	Advantages of using efavirenz as part of treatment for children infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) include once-daily dosing , simplification of co-treatment for tuberculosis , preservation of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir for second-line treatment , and harmonization of adult and pediatric treatment regimens .
Problem	However , there have been concerns about possible reduced viral efficacy of efavirenz in children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission .
Problem	To evaluate whether nevirapine-exposed children achieving initial viral suppression with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy can transition to efavirenz-based therapy without risk of viral failure .
Method	Randomized , open-label noninferiority trial conducted at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital , Johannesburg , South Africa , from June @ to December @ , enrolling @ HIV-infected children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission who were aged @ years or older and had plasma HIV RNA of less than @ copies/mL during ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy ; @ were randomized and @ ( @ % ) were followed up to @ weeks after randomization .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to switch to efavirenz-based therapy ( n = @ ) or continue ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy ( n = @ ) .
Method	Risk difference between groups in ( @ ) viral rebound ( ie , @ HIV RNA measurement of > @ copies/mL ) and ( @ ) viral failure ( ie , confirmed HIV RNA > @ copies/mL ) with a noninferiority bound of -@ .
Method	Immunologic and clinical responses were secondary end points .
Result	The Kaplan-Meier probability of viral rebound by @ weeks was @ ( n = @ ) in the efavirenz group and @ ( n = @ ) in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group .
Result	Probabilities of viral failure were @ ( n = @ ) in the efavirenz group and @ ( n = @ ) in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group .
Result	The risk difference for viral rebound was @ ( @-sided @ % CI , @ to ) and for viral failure was -@ ( @-sided @ % CI , -@ to ) .
Result	We rejected the null hypothesis that efavirenz is inferior to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir ( P < @ ) for both end points .
Result	By @ weeks , CD@ cell percentage was @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) higher in the efavirenz group than in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group .
Conclusion	Among HIV-infected children exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission and with initial viral suppression with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy , switching to efavirenz-based therapy compared with continuing ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy did not result in significantly higher rates of viral rebound or viral failure .
Conclusion	This therapeutic approach may offer advantages in children such as these .

Background	The successful treatment of intraabdominal infection requires a combination of anatomical source control and antibiotics .
Background	The appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy remains unclear .
Method	We randomly assigned @ patients with complicated intraabdominal infection and adequate source control to receive antibiotics until @ days after the resolution of fever , leukocytosis , and ileus , with a maximum of @ days of therapy ( control group ) , or to receive a fixed course of antibiotics ( experimental group ) for @ calendar days .
Method	The primary outcome was a composite of surgical-site infection , recurrent intraabdominal infection , or death within @ days after the index source-control procedure , according to treatment group .
Method	Secondary outcomes included the duration of therapy and rates of subsequent infections .
Result	Surgical-site infection , recurrent intraabdominal infection , or death occurred in @ of @ patients in the experimental group ( @ % ) , as compared with @ of @ patients in the control group ( @ % ) ( absolute difference , -@ percentage point ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -@ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	The median duration of antibiotic therapy was @ days ( interquartile range , @ to @ ) in the experimental group , as compared with @ days ( interquartile range , @ to @ ) in the control group ( absolute difference , -@ days ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ; P < @ ) .
Result	No significant between-group differences were found in the individual rates of the components of the primary outcome or in other secondary outcomes .
Conclusion	In patients with intraabdominal infections who had undergone an adequate source-control procedure , the outcomes after fixed-duration antibiotic therapy ( approximately @ days ) were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics ( approximately @ days ) that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities .

Problem	To evaluate the analgesic and physiological effects of epidural morphine administered at the sixth and seventh lumbar or the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae in dogs undergoing thoracotomy .
Method	Prospective , randomized , blinded trial .
Method	Fourteen mixed-breed dogs , weighing @ @ kg .
Method	The animals received acepromazine ( @ mg kg ) IM and anesthesia was induced with propofol ( @ mg kg ) IV .
Method	The lumbosacral space was punctured and an epidural catheter was inserted up to the region between the sixth and seventh lumbar vertebrae ( L , n = @ ) or up to the fifth or sixth intercostal space ( T , n = @ ) .
Method	The dogs were allowed to recover and after radiographic confirmation of correct catheter position , anesthesia was reinduced with propofol IV and maintained with @ % isoflurane .
Method	Following stabilization of monitored parameters , animals received morphine ( @ mg kg ) diluted in @ % NaCl to a final volume of @ mL kg via the epidural catheter , and after @ minutes , thoracotomy was initiated .
Method	Heart rate and rhythm , systolic , mean and diastolic arterial pressures , respiratory rate , arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation , partial pressure of expired CO and body temperature were measured immediately before the epidural administration of morphine ( @ minute ) and every @ minutes during the anesthetic period .
Method	The Melbourne pain scale and the visual analog scale were used to assess postoperative pain .
Method	The evaluation began @ hours after the epidural administration of morphine and occurred each hour until rescue analgesia .
Result	There were no important variations in the physiological parameters during the anesthetic period .
Result	The post-operative analgesic period differed between the groups , being longer in T ( @ @ hours ) compared with L ( @ @ hours ) .
Conclusion	The use of morphine , at a volume of @ mL kg @ , administered epidurally over the thoracic vertebrae provided longer lasting analgesia than when deposited over the lumbar vertebrae .

Background	Swallowing problems following stroke may result in increased risk of aspiration pneumonia , malnutrition , and dehydration .
Problem	Our hypothesis was that three neurostimulation techniques would produce beneficial effects on chronic dysphagia following stroke through a common brain mechanism that would predict behavioral response .
Method	In @ dysphagic stroke patients ( mean age : @ @ years , @ female , time-post-stroke : @ @ weeks -LSB- SD -RSB- ) , pharyngeal electromyographic responses were recorded after single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) over the pharyngeal motor cortex , to measure corticobulbar excitability before , immediately , and @ min , after real and sham applications of neurostimulation .
Method	Patients were randomized to a single session of either : pharyngeal electrical stimulation ( PES ) , paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) or repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) .
Method	Penetration-aspiration scores and bolus transfer timings were assessed before and after both real and sham interventions using videofluoroscopy .
Result	Corticobulbar excitability of pharyngeal motor cortex was beneficially modulated by PES , PAS and to a lesser extent by rTMS , with functionally relevant changes in the unaffected hemisphere .
Result	Following combining the results of real neurostimulation , an overall increase in corticobulbar excitability in the unaffected hemisphere ( P = @ , F@ ,@ = @ , ANOVA ) with an associated @ % reduction in aspiration ( P = @ , z = -@ ) was observed compared to sham .
Conclusion	In this mechanistic study , an increase in corticobulbar excitability the unaffected projection was correlated with the improvement in swallowing safety ( P = @ , rho = -@ ) , but modality-specific differences were observed .
Conclusion	Paradigms providing peripheral input favored change in neurophysiological and behavioral outcome measures in chronic dysphagia patients .
Conclusion	Further larger cohort studies of neurostimulation in chronic dysphagic stroke are imperative .

Method	Controlled , repeated-measures , single-blind randomized study .
Problem	To determine the effect of cervical or thoracic manipulation on neurotensin , oxytocin , orexin A , and cortisol levels .
Background	Previous studies have researched the effect of spinal manipulation on pain modulation and/or range of movement .
Background	However , there is little knowledge of the biochemical process that supports the antinociceptive effect of spinal manipulation .
Method	Thirty asymptomatic subjects were randomly divided into @ groups : cervical manipulation ( n = @ ) , thoracic manipulation ( n = @ ) , and nonmanipulation ( control ) ( n = @ ) .
Method	Blood samples were extracted before , immediately after , and @ hours after each intervention .
Method	Neurotensin , oxytocin , and orexin A were determined in plasma using enzyme-linked immuno assay .
Method	Cortisol was measured by microparticulate enzyme immuno assay in serum samples .
Result	Immediately after the intervention , significantly higher values of neurotensin ( P < @ ) and oxytocin ( P < @ ) levels were observed with both cervical and thoracic manipulation , whereas cortisol concentration was increased only in the cervical manipulation group ( P < @ ) .
Result	No changes were detected for orexin A levels .
Result	Two hours after the intervention , no significant differences were observed in between-group analysis .
Conclusion	The mechanical stimulus provided by spinal manipulation triggers an increase in neurotensin , oxytocin , and cortisol blood levels .
Conclusion	Data suggest that the initial capability of the tissues to tolerate mechanical deformation affects the capacity of these tissues to produce an induction of neuropeptide expression .

Background	Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is an important independent risk factor for stroke and oral anticoagulation therapy provides a highly effective treatment to reduce this risk .
Background	Active screening strategies improve detection of AF in comparison with routine care ; however , whether screen-detected patients have stroke risk profiles favouring anticoagulation is unclear .
Background	Using data derived from the screening for AF in the elderly ( SAFE ) study , the aim of this article was to determine if patients with AF detected via active screening have stroke risk profiles that warrant prophylactic anticoagulation .
Method	Secondary analysis of data derived from @ general practices within which cohorts of @ patients were randomly allocated to opportunistic -LSB- pulse and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) -RSB- or systematic screening ( postal invitation for ECG ) .
Method	Stroke risk assessment was undertaken using baseline data extracted from medical records and CHADS@ criteria .
Method	CHADS@ scores were compared between the screening groups .
Result	One hundred and forty-nine new cases of AF were detected , @ via opportunistic screening and @ via systematic screening .
Result	CHADS@ scores were @ in @ % -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- of patients detected via opportunistic screening and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) detected via systematic screening .
Result	There were no significant differences in stroke risk profiles of patients detected via opportunistic and systematic screenings .
Conclusion	Stroke risk profiles of patients detected via opportunistic and systematic screenings were similar .
Conclusion	Data derived from the SAFE study suggest that active screening for AF in patients aged @ years in primary care is a useful screening programme with @-@ % of patients identified eligible for anticoagulation treatment according to the CHADS@ criteria .

Background	There is a paucity of data on the effect of antiretroviral medications on male fertility .
Background	Couples affected by HIV-@ often have fertility intentions , and antiretroviral medications , as both treatment of HIV-@-infected persons and pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) for uninfected persons , are part of peri-conception risk reduction .
Method	Within a randomized , placebo-controlled trial of daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) and combination emtricitabine ( FTC ) / TDF PrEP for HIV-@ prevention conducted among heterosexual HIV-@-serodiscordant couples , we assessed the impact of TDF and FTC/TDF use on male fertility , measured as incident pregnancy in female partners of men assigned to PrEP vs. placebo .
Result	Of the @ HIV-@-uninfected men partners , @ were randomized to TDF , @ to FTC/TDF , and @ to placebo .
Result	The overall pregnancy incidence in their HIV-@-infected female partners was @ per @ person-years and did not differ significantly across the study arms ( @ TDF , @ FTC/TDF , @ placebo ) .
Result	The frequency of live births , pregnancy losses , and gestational age at birth or loss was also statistically similar in the three randomization groups .
Conclusion	TDF and FTC/TDF , when used as PrEP by HIV-@-uninfected men , did not adversely affect male fertility or pregnancy outcomes .

Problem	Few investigations have addressed the safety of oxygen from concentrators for use in anesthesia in association with nitrous oxide .
Problem	This study evaluated the percent of oxygen from a concentrator in association with nitrous oxide in a semi-closed rebreathing circuit .
Method	Adult patients undergoing low risk surgery were randomly allocated into two groups , receiving a fresh gas flow of oxygen from concentrators ( O@ ) or of oxygen from concentrators and nitrous oxide ( O@N@O ) .
Method	The fraction of inspired oxygen and the percentage of oxygen from fresh gas flow were measured every @ min .
Method	The ratio of FiO@/oxygen concentration delivered was compared at various time intervals and between the groups .
Result	Thirty patients were studied in each group .
Result	There was no difference in oxygen from concentrators over time for both groups , but there was a significant improvement in the FiO@ ( p < @ ) for O@ group while a significant decline ( p < @ ) for O@N@O .
Result	The FiO@/oxygen ratio varied in both groups , reaching a plateau in the O@ group .
Result	Pulse oximetry did not fall below @ % in either group .
Conclusion	The FiO@ in the mixture of O@ and nitrous oxide fell during the observation period although oxygen saturation was higher than @ % throughout the study .
Conclusion	Concentrators can be considered a stable source of oxygen for use during short anesthetic procedures , either pure or in association with nitrous oxide at @:@ volume .

Background	Although hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) and hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infections are vaccine-preventable diseases , few homeless parolees coming out of prisons and jails have received the hepatitis A and B vaccination series .
Problem	The study focused on completion of the HAV and HBV vaccine series among homeless men on parole .
Problem	The efficacy of three levels of peer coaching ( PC ) and nurse-delivered interventions was compared at @-month follow-up : ( a ) intensive peer coaching and nurse case management ( PC-NCM ) ; ( b ) intensive PC intervention condition , with minimal nurse involvement ; and ( c ) usual care ( UC ) intervention condition , which included minimal PC and nurse involvement .
Problem	Furthermore , we assessed predictors of vaccine completion among this targeted sample .
Method	A randomized control trial was conducted with @ recently paroled men to assess the impact of the three intervention conditions ( PC-NCM vs. PC vs. UC ) on reducing drug use and recidivism ; of these , @ seronegative , vaccine-eligible subjects were included in this analysis of completion of the Twinrix HAV/HBV vaccine .
Method	Logistic regression was added to assess predictors of completion of the HAV/HBV vaccine series and chi-square analysis to compare completion rates across the three levels of intervention .
Result	Vaccine completion rate for the intervention conditions were @ % ( PC-NCM ) , @ % ( PC ) , and @ % ( UC ; p = @ ) .
Result	Predictors of vaccine noncompletion included being Asian and Pacific Islander , experiencing high levels of hostility , positive social support , reporting a history of injection drug use , being released early from California prisons , and being admitted for psychiatric illness .
Result	Predictors of vaccine series completion included reporting having six or more friends , recent cocaine use , and staying in drug treatment for at least @ days .
Conclusion	Findings allow greater understanding of factors affecting vaccination completion in order to design more effective programs among the high-risk population of men recently released from prison and on parole .

Background	Guidelines recommend lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) as first - and second-line therapy for young and older HIV-infected children , respectively .
Background	Available formulations have limitations making their widespread use complex .
Method	An open-label comparative bioavailability ( randomized crossover ) study compared a novel twice-daily minitab sprinkle formulation ( @ mg/@ mg , Cipla Pharmaceuticals ) versus innovator syrup in HIV-infected Ugandan infants aged @ to < @ months ( cohort A ) and children aged @-@ years ( cohort B ) and versus Cipla tablets ( @/@ mg ) in children aged @ to < @ years ( cohort C ) .
Method	Twelve-hour intensive pharmacokinetic sampling after observed LPV/r intake ( plus @ nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ) following World Health Organization @ dosing with food was performed @ weeks after enrollment .
Method	Children then switched formulation ; sampling was repeated at week @ .
Method	Acceptability data were also collected .
Result	Seventy-seven infants/children were included in cohort A ( n = @ ) / B ( n = @ ) / C ( n = @ ) .
Result	Among @ evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles , there were @/@/@ within-child comparisons in cohort A/B/C .
Result	For minitabs versus syrup , geometric mean -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -RSB- AUC@-@h was @ ( @-@ @ ) versus @ ( @-@ @ ) hmg/L in cohort A -LSB- geometric mean ratio ( GMR ) ( @ % CI ) = @ ( @ to @ ) -RSB- and @ ( @ to @ ) versus @ ( @ to @ ) hmg/L in cohort B -LSB- GMR ( @ % CI ) = @ ( @ to @ ) -RSB- .
Result	For minitabs versus tablets , geometric mean ( @ % CI ) AUC@-@h was @ ( @ to @ ) versus @ ( @ to @ ) hmg/L ; GMR ( @ % CI ) = @ ( @ to @ ) .
Result	Subtherapeutic levels ( < @ mg/L ) occurred in @ ( @ % ) / @ ( @ % ) minitabs/syrup in infants ( P = @ ) , no children aged @-@ years and @ ( @ % ) / @ ( @ % ) minitabs/tablets ( P = @ ) .
Result	About @/@ ( @ % ) and @/@ ( @ % ) caregivers of infants and children aged @-@ years , respectively , chose to continue minitabs after week @ , mainly for convenience ; only @/@ ( @ % ) older children ( five < @ years ) remained on minitabs .
Conclusion	LPV/r exposure from minitabs was comparable with syrup , but lower than tablets , with no significant differences in subtherapeutic concentrations .
Conclusion	Minitabs were more acceptable than syrups for younger children , but older children preferred tablets .

Background	In rural South Africa , only two-thirds of HIV-positive pregnant women seeking antenatal care at community health centers took full advantage of ` prevention of mother-to-child transmission ' ( PMTCT ) services in @ .
Background	Studies generally support male involvement to promote PMTCT , but the nature and impact of that involvement is unclear and untested .
Background	Additionally , stigma , disclosure and intimate partner violence pose significant barriers to PMTCT uptake and retention in care , suggesting that male involvement may be ` necessary , but not sufficient ' to reduce infant HIV incidence .
Background	This study expands on a successful United States President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) - supported PMTCT couples intervention pilot study conducted in the Mpumalanga province , targeting HIV-positive pregnant women and their partners , the primary objective being to determine whether male partner involvement plus a behavioral intervention will significantly reduce infant HIV incidence .
Method	The study follows a cluster randomized controlled design enrolling two cohorts of HIV-positive pregnant women recruited from @ randomly assigned Community Health Centers ( CHC ) ( six experimental , six control ) .
Method	The two cohorts will consist of women attending without their male partners ( n = @ ) and women attending with their male partners ( n = @ couples ) , in order to determine whether the influence of male participation itself , or combined with a behavioral PMTCT intervention , can significantly reduce infant HIV infection ante - , peri - and postnatally .
Conclusion	It is our intention to significantly increase PMTCT participation from current levels ( @ % ) in the Mpumalanga province to between @ and @ % through engaging women and couples in a controlled , six session ante - and postnatal risk-reducing and PMTCT promotion intervention addressing barriers to PMTCT ( such as stigma , disclosure , intimate partner violence , communication , infant feeding practices and safer conception ) that prevent women and men from utilizing treatment opportunities available to them and their infants .
Conclusion	Based upon the encouraging preliminary results from our pilot study , successful CHC adoption of the program could have major public health policy implications for containing the epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in rural South Africa : HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants .

Background	Lack of universal , annual testing for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) in health facilities suggests that expansion of HIV testing and counselling ( HTC ) to non-clinical settings is critical to the achievement of national goals for prevention , care and treatment .
Background	Consideration should be given to the ability of lay counsellors to perform home-based HTC in community settings .
Method	We implemented a community cluster randomized controlled trial of home-based HTC in Sisonke District , South Africa .
Method	Trained lay counsellors conducted door-to-door HIV testing using the same rapid tests used by the local health department at the time of the study ( SD Bioline and Sensa ) .
Method	To monitor testing quality and counsellor skill , additional dry blood spots were taken and sent for laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) testing .
Method	Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the laboratory result as the gold standard .
Conclusion	From @ samples , the counsellor and laboratory results matched in all but @ cases .
Conclusion	In @ cases , the counsellor judged the result as indeterminate , whereas the laboratory judged @ positive , eight negative and three indeterminate , indicating that the counsellor may have erred on the side of caution .
Conclusion	Sensitivity was @ % ( @ % CI : @-@ @ % ) , and specificity @ % ( @ % CI : @-@ @ % ) , for the lay counsellor field-based rapid tests .
Conclusion	Both measures are high , and the lower confidence bound for specificity meets the international standard for assessing HIV rapid tests .
Conclusion	These findings indicate that adequately trained lay counsellors are capable of safely conducting high-quality rapid HIV tests and interpreting the results as per the kit guidelines .
Conclusion	These findings are important given the likely expansion of community and home-based testing models and the shortage of clinically trained professional staff .

Method	Their baseline data , coronary artery disease characteristics , platelet count , adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) - induced platelet inhibition rate by thrombelastograph after @ days of treatment , the major adverse cardiovascular events of the follow up for @ months and bleeding complications were observed and compared in the two groups .
Result	The differences between the two groups of patients with their baseline data , the features of coronary artery lesions , platelet count before and after @ days of treatment had no statistical significance ( P > @ ) .
Result	ADP induced platelet inhibition rate -LSB- ( @ ) % -RSB- after @ days of treatment in ticagrelor group was significantly higher than that in clopidogrel group -LSB- ( @ ) % , P < @ -RSB- .
Result	The two groups of patients were followed up for @ months , @ cases of major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in clopidogrel group , @ cases of major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in ticagrelor group , and there was significant difference between the two groups ( P < @ ) .
Result	The two groups ( @ cases of @ patients in ticagrelor group vs. @ cases of @ patients in clopidogrel group ) had no statistically significant difference in bleeding complications ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	Antiplatelet therapy of ticagrelor on patients suffering from acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing emergency PCI has good efficacy and safety .

Background	In-water resuscitation ( IWR ) is recommended in the @ guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council .
Background	As IWR represents a physical challenge to the rescuer , a novel Rescue Tube device with an integrated `` Oxylator '' resuscitator might facilitate IWR .
Background	The aim of the present study was the assessment of IWR using the novel Rescue Tube device .
Method	Tidal and minute volumes were recorded using a modified Laerdal Resusci Anne mannequin .
Method	Furthermore , rescue time , water aspiration , submersions , and physical exertion were assessed .
Method	In this randomized cross-over trial , @ lifeguards performed four rescue maneuvers over a @-m distance in open water in random order : no ventilation ( NV ) , mouth-to-mouth ventilation ( MMV ) , Oxylator-aided mask ventilation ( OMV ) , and Oxylator-aided laryngeal tube ventilation ( OLTV ) .
Result	OLTV resulted in effective ventilation over the entire rescue distance with the highest mean minute volumes ( NV @ , MMV @ , OMV @ , OLTV @ L min ( -@ ) ) .
Result	NV was the fastest rescue maneuver while IWR prolonged the rescue maneuver independently of the method of ventilation ( mean total rescue time : NV @ , MMV @ , OMV @ , OLTV @ s ) .
Result	Aspiration of substantial amounts of water occurred only during MMV ( mean NV @ , MMV @ , OMV @ , OLTV @ ml ) .
Result	NV and OLTV were rated as moderately challenging by the lifeguards , whereas MMV and OMV were rated as substantially demanding on a @-@ visual analog scale ( NV @ , MMV @ , OMV @ , OLTV @ ) .
Conclusion	The device might facilitate IWR by providing effective ventilation with minimal aspiration and by reducing physical effort .
Conclusion	Another advantage is the possibility of delivering @ % oxygen .

Background	Enterococci , the second leading cause of health care-associated infections , have evolved from commensal and harmless organisms to multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with a significant increase in patient morbidity and mortality .
Background	Prevention of ongoing spread of this organism within and between hospitals is important .
Background	In this study , we characterized Enterococcus transmission dynamics for bacterial reservoirs commonly encountered by anesthesia providers during the routine administration of general anesthesia .
Method	Enterococcus isolates previously obtained from bacterial reservoirs frequently encountered by anesthesiologists ( patient nasopharynx and axilla , anesthesia provider hands , and the adjustable pressure-limiting valve and agent dial of the anesthesia machine ) at @ major academic medical centers were identified as possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events by class of pathogen , temporal association , and phenotypic analysis ( analytical profile indexing ) .
Method	They were then subjected to antibiotic disk diffusion sensitivity for transmission event confirmation .
Method	Isolates involved in confirmed transmission events were further analyzed to characterize the frequency , mode , origin , location of transmission events , and antibiotic susceptibility of transmitted pathogens .
Result	Three hundred eighty-nine anesthesia reservoir isolates were previously identified by gross morphology and simple rapid tests as Enterococcus .
Result	The combination of further analytical profile indexing analysis and temporal association implicated @ % ( @/@ ) of those isolates in possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events .
Result	Approximately , @ % ( @/@ ) of possible transmission events were confirmed by additional antibiotic disk diffusion analysis .
Result	Two phenotypes , E@ and E@ , explained @ % ( @/@ ) of confirmed transmission events .
Result	For both phenotypes , provider hands were a common reservoir of origin proximal to the transmission event ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- hand origin for E@ and @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- hand origin for E@ ) and site of transmission ( @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- hand transmission location for E@ and @ % -LSB- @/@ -RSB- hand transmission location for E@ ) .
Conclusion	Anesthesia provider hand contamination is a common proximal source and transmission location for Enterococcus transmission events in the anesthesia work area .
Conclusion	Future work should evaluate the impact of intraoperative hand hygiene improvement strategies on the dynamics of intraoperative Enterococcus transmission .

Background	The postpericardiotomy syndrome ( PPS ) is a common complication following cardiac surgery .
Background	The pathophysiology remains unclear , although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS .
Background	We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS , by reducing this inflammatory response .
Method	We performed a subanalysis of the DECS study , which is a multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial of @,@ patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass .
Method	The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of @ mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death , myocardial infarction , stroke , renal failure , or respiratory failure , within @ days of randomization .
Method	In this substudy , we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in @ patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery .
Method	Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if @ of @ listed symptoms were present : unexplained fever , pleuritic chest pain , pericardial or pleural rub , new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion .
Method	All medical charts , x-rays , and echocardiograms were reviewed .
Method	Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS , defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion , pericardiocentesis , and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS .
Method	This is a blinded , single-center , post hoc analysis .
Result	Postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) .
Result	The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was @ % vs @ % ( relative risk @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	For complicated PPS , the incidence was @ % versus @ % ( relative risk @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) , respectively .
Conclusion	In patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery , high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS .

Background	Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting disease that is caused by defective or deficient cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein activity .
Background	Phe@del is the most common CFTR mutation .
Method	We conducted two phase @ , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies that were designed to assess the effects of lumacaftor ( VX-@ ) , a CFTR corrector , in combination with ivacaftor ( VX-@ ) , a CFTR potentiator , in patients @ years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the Phe@del CFTR mutation .
Method	In both studies , patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor ( @ mg once daily or @ mg every @ hours ) in combination with ivacaftor ( @ mg every @ hours ) or matched placebo for @ weeks .
Method	The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) at week @ .
Result	A total of @ patients underwent randomization and received study drug .
Result	The mean baseline FEV@ was @ % of the predicted value .
Result	In both studies , there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor-ivacaftor dose groups ; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV@ ranged from @ to @ percentage points ( P < @ ) , which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of @ to @ % ( P < @ ) .
Result	Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was @ to @ % lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group ; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups as well .
Result	The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups .
Result	The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was @ % among patients who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor versus @ % among those who received placebo .
Conclusion	These data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe@del CFTR mutation .
Conclusion	( Funded by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and others ; TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT ClinicalTrials.gov numbers , NCT@ and NCT@ . )

Background	Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with considerable health risks .
Background	Although continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) can mitigate these risks , effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment .
Background	We evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at @ months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea .
Method	Using a multicenter , prospective , single-group , cohort design , we surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy .
Method	The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ; the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour , with a score of @ indicating moderate-to-severe apnea ) and the oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by @ percentage points from baseline ) .
Method	Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale , the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) , and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than @ % .
Method	Consecutive participants with a response were included in a randomized , controlled therapy-withdrawal trial .
Result	The study included @ participants ; @ % were men .
Result	The mean age was @ years , and the mean body-mass index ( the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters ) was @ .
Result	The median AHI score at @ months decreased @ % , from @ events per hour to @ events per hour ( P < @ ) ; the ODI score decreased @ % , from @ events per hour to @ events per hour ( P < @ ) .
Result	Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life .
Result	In the randomized phase , the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the @-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the @ participants in the therapy-maintenance group ( @ and @ events per hour , respectively ) ; the AHI score was significantly higher ( indicating more severe apnea ) among the @ participants in the therapy-withdrawal group ( @ vs. @ events per hour , P < @ ) .
Result	The ODI results followed a similar pattern .
Result	The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than @ % .
Conclusion	In this uncontrolled cohort study , upper-airway stimulation led to significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea .

Problem	We compare attribution and social comparison theories as potential explanations for attitudes towards overweight and underweight targets among Australian university students .
Method	@ female students ( median age @ ) completed a measure of body image state , then read one of six vignettes , describing a female student who was underweight , average weight or overweight , and who did or did not have a medical condition affecting weight .
Method	Independent variables were target weight ( underweight , average-weight , overweight ) ; weight controllability ( no information , uncontrollable ) ; and participant body image ( higher , lower ) .
Method	Participants evaluated the target on six characteristics derived from existing research on weight bias , on seven-point Likert scales : attractive ; healthy ; likeable ; motivated ; self-disciplined ; having willpower .
Result	A three-way between-participants multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted , with post hoc comparisons of significant effects .
Result	Overweight targets were rated more negatively than average-weight and underweight targets .
Result	Uncontrollability ( medical ) information produced more positive evaluations of the overweight target , but more negative evaluations of the underweight target .
Result	Ratings of the average-weight target were not influenced by uncontrollability information .
Result	Participant body image state had no significant effects .
Conclusion	Results provided partial support for attribution theory , but not for social comparison theory , as an explanation of weight bias .

Problem	This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a sufentanil sublingual tablet system ( SSTS ) for the management of postoperative pain following open abdominal surgery .
Method	At @ hospital sites in the United States , patients following surgery with pain intensity of greater than @ on an @-point numerical rating scale were randomized to receive SSTS dispensing a @-g sufentanil tablet sublingually with a @-minute lockout or an identical system dispensing a placebo tablet sublingually .
Method	Pain intensity scores were recorded at baseline and for up to @ hours after starting study drug .
Method	The primary end point was time-weighted summed pain intensity difference ( SPID ) over @ hours .
Method	Secondary end points included SPID and total pain relief ( TOTPAR ) for up to @ hours and patient and health care provider global assessments of the method of pain control .
Result	Summed pain intensity difference over @ hours was significantly higher in the SSTS group than in the placebo group ( least squares mean -LSB- SEM -RSB- , @ -LSB- @ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
Result	Mean SPID and TOTPAR scores were significantly higher in the SSTS group at all time points from @ hour ( SPID ) or @ hours ( TOTPAR ) until @ hours ( P < @ ) .
Result	In the SSTS group , patient global assessment and health care provider global assessment ratings of good or excellent were greater than placebo at all time points ( P < @ ) .
Result	Safety parameters , including adverse events and vital signs , were similar for SSTS and placebo .
Conclusion	These results suggest that SSTS is effective and safe for the management of postoperative pain in patients following open abdominal surgery .

Problem	Guanfacine extended - release ( GXR ) is approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents .
Problem	As part of the clinical development of GXR , and to further explore the effect of guanfacine on QT intervals , a thorough QT study of guanfacine was conducted ( ClinicalTrials .
Problem	gov identifier : NCT@ ) .
Method	In this double-blind , @-period , crossover trial , healthy adults ( n = @ ) received immediaterelease guanfacine ( at therapeutic ( @ mg ) and supra-therapeutic ( @ mg ) doses ) , placebo , and @ mg moxifloxacin ( positive control ) in @ of @ randomly assigned sequences .
Method	Continuous @-lead electrocardiograms were extracted , and guanfacine plasma concentrations were assessed pre-dose and at intervals up to @ hours post-dose .
Method	QT intervals were corrected using @ methods : subject-specific ( QTcNi ) and Fridericia ( QTcF ) .
Method	Time-matched analyses examined the largest , baseline-adjusted , drug-placebo difference in QTc intervals .
Result	In the QTcNi analysis , the largest @-sided @ % upper confidence bound ( UCB ) through hour @ was @ ms ( @ hours postdose ) .
Result	For the @-hour QTcF analysis , the largest @-sided @ % UCB was @ ms ( @ hours post-supratherapeutic dose ) , representing the only @-sided @ % UCB > @ ms. Following the supra-therapeutic dose , maximum guanfacine plasma concentration was attained at @ hours ( median ) post-dose .
Result	Assay sensitivity was confirmed by moxifloxacin results .
Result	Among guanfacine-treated subjects , most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild ( @ % ) ; dry mouth ( @ % ) and dizziness ( @ % ) were most common .
Conclusion	Neither therapeutic nor supra-therapeutic doses of guanfacine prolonged QT interval after adjusting for heart rate using individualized correction , QTcNi , through @ hours postdose .
Conclusion	Guanfacine does not appear to interfere with cardiac repolarization of the form associated with pro-arrhythmic drugs .

Problem	Part @ of this phase III study was a randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , multicenter study of caregiver administered diazepam auto-injector ( AI ) in subjects with acute repetitive seizures ( ARS ) and demonstrated that diazepam AI was well-tolerated and significantly more effective than placebo AI in delaying the time to next seizure or rescue .

Background	Epidemiologic data suggest that low serum @-hydroxyvitamin D -LSB- @ ( OH ) D -RSB- increases insulin resistance and the risk of type @ diabetes .
Background	Few interventional trials have assessed the effect of vitamin D on insulin metabolism , and published results are discordant .
Problem	The goal of this study was to perform a detailed assessment of the effect of ergocalciferol administration on glucose and insulin metabolism in healthy people with low total @ ( OH ) D ( total ) .
Method	This was a @-wk , double-blinded , randomized controlled trial .
Method	We enrolled @ healthy volunteers aged @-@ y with serum @ ( OH ) D @ ng/mL ( by immunoassay ) and administered @,@ IU ergocalciferol/wk or placebo for @ wk .
Method	Primary endpoints were change in first-phase insulin response and insulin sensitivity as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test .
Method	Secondary endpoints included change in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ; fasting glucose , insulin , and lipids ; body mass index ( BMI ) ; and blood pressure .
Result	On-study @ ( OH ) D ( total ) was assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
Result	In the treated group , @ ( OH ) D ( total ) rose from @ @ to @ @ ng/mL ( P < @ ) with no change in the placebo group .
Result	Despite this increase , at @ wk , there were no between-group differences in either insulin response or insulin sensitivity ; nor were there differences in any measured secondary endpoints .
Result	There was no evidence of effect modification by sex , race , glucose tolerance status , baseline @ ( OH ) D ( total ) , or BMI .
Conclusion	In healthy persons with low @ ( OH ) D ( total ) , ergocalciferol administration for @ wk normalizes @ ( OH ) D ( total ) but does not improve insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity , or other markers of metabolic health .

Background	A computerized Intervention-Management-System ( IMS ) has been developed and implemented to facilitate dementia care management .
Background	IMS is a rule-based expert decision support system that matches individual patient characteristics to a computerized knowledge base .
Background	One of the most important functionalities of IMS is to support the compilation of the individual intervention plan by systematically identifying unmet needs and suggesting the corresponding specific interventions for recommendation to the general practitioner ( GP ) .
Background	The present analysis aimed to determine if the implementation of IMS improves the identification of unmet needs and the recommendation of adequate specific interventions .
Background	In addition , the feasibility and acceptability of the IMS were evaluated .
Method	Delphi-MV is an on-going GP-based , cluster-randomized , controlled intervention trial to implement and evaluate a collaborative dementia care management program for community-dwelling PWDs and their caregivers .
Method	IMS was developed and implemented over the course of the DelpHi-trial .
Method	The identified unmet needs and the interventions that were recommended to the GP before and after the implementation of IMS were compared .
Method	To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the IMS , a survey was conducted among the current users of IMS .
Conclusion	After the implementation of IMS , the number of specific interventions recommended to the GP increased by @ % .
Conclusion	Our findings provide evidence that IMS improves the systematic identification of unmet needs and the subsequent recommendation of interventions to address these needs .
Conclusion	The users evaluated IMS as very helpful and would like to use it for their future work .
Conclusion	However , the usability could be further improved .

Background	Recently , men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer ( PC ) were classified into favorable and unfavorable categories ; however , whether the risk of PC-specific mortality ( PCSM ) among men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC is increased is unknown .
Method	In a prospective , randomized trial conducted between @ and @ , @ men with intermediate-risk or high-risk PC were randomized to receive @ Gy with or without @ months of androgen-suppression therapy ( AST ) .
Method	The subgroup of @ patients with information available on the percentage of positive biopsies formed the cohort .
Method	Fine and Gray regression analysis was used to assess whether men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC had an increased risk of PCSM .
Result	After a median follow-up of @ years , there were @ deaths ( @ % ) , including @ deaths ( @ % ) from PC .
Result	There were no PC deaths in the favorable intermediate-risk group .
Result	There was an increase in the risk of PCSM among men with high-risk PC versus unfavorable intermediate-risk PC , but the difference was not significant ( adjusted hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) after adjusting for age , randomized treatment arm , and comorbidity .
Conclusion	The lack of PC deaths among men with favorable intermediate-risk PC suggests that adding AST may not reduce their risk of PCSM ; whereas many men with unfavorable intermediate-risk PC are at risk for harboring occult PC with Gleason scores from @ to @ and , if proven , would benefit from long-term AST .
Conclusion	Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions should be considered to identify PC with Gleason scores from @ to @ in these men .

Problem	Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( PPPD ) has been associated with a high incidence of delayed gastric emptying ( DGE ) .
Problem	There are few studies comparing DGE associated with PPPD and subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy ( SSPPD ) .
Problem	Moreover , differences between the procedures with respect to long-term results have not been reported .
Problem	A prospective randomized study was conducted to compare perioperative complications and long-term nutritional status with PPPD and SSPPD .
Method	One hundred patients with periampullary lesions were randomized to receive either PPPD ( n = @ ) or SSPPD ( n = @ ) .
Method	All patients were followed up for @ years after surgery or to the time of recurrence to evaluate nutritional status for the study .
Method	The effects of the procedure , age , and malignancy on changes in nutritional indicators were estimated with linear mixed models .
Method	This study was registered at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry ( UMIN @ ) .
Result	The incidence of DGE assessed by the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery was @ % with PPPD and @ % with SSPPD ( P = @ ) .
Result	There were no significant differences between the two procedures on postoperative serum albumin levels , serum total cholesterol levels , and body mass index during the @-year follow-up period .
Conclusion	SSPPD is equally effective in DGE occurrence rate and long-term nutritional status comparing to PPPD .

Background	Kawasaki disease , the most common cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries , is a self-limited vasculitis that is treated with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin .
Background	Resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin in Kawasaki disease increases the risk of coronary artery aneurysms .
Background	We assessed whether the addition of infliximab to standard therapy ( intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin ) in acute Kawasaki disease reduces the rate of treatment resistance .
Method	We undertook a phase @ , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in two children 's hospitals in the USA to assess the addition of infliximab ( @ mg per kg ) to standard therapy .
Method	Eligible participants were children aged @ weeks-@ years who had a fever ( temperature @C ) for @-@ days and met American Heart Association criteria for Kawasaki disease .
Method	Participants were randomly allocated in @:@ ratio to two treatment groups : infliximab @ mg/kg at @ mg/mL intravenously over @ h or placebo ( normal saline @ mL/kg , administered intravenously ) .
Method	Randomisation was based on a randomly permuted block design ( block sizes @ and @ ) , stratified by age , sex , and centre .
Method	Patients , treating physicians and staff , study team members , and echocardiographers were all masked to treament assignment .
Method	The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in treatment resistance defined as a temperature of @C or higher at @ h to @ days after completion of the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin .
Method	Analysis was by intention to treat .
Method	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT@ .
Result	@ patients were enrolled and randomised : @ to the infliximab group and @ to placebo .
Result	One patient in the placebo group was withdrawn from the study because of hypotension before receiving treatment .
Result	Treatment resistance rate did not differ significantly ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- for infliximab and @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- for placebo ; p = @ ) .
Result	Compared with the placebo group , participants given infliximab had fewer days of fever ( median @ day for infliximab vs @ days for placebo ; p < @ ) .
Result	At week @ , infliximab-treated patients had greater mean reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( p = @ ) and a two-fold greater decrease in Z score of the left anterior descending artery ( p = @ ) than did those in the placebo group , but this difference was not significant at week @ .
Result	Participants in the infliximab group had a greater mean reduction in C-reactive protein concentration ( p = @ ) and in absolute neutrophil count ( p = @ ) at @ h after treatment than did those given placebo , but by week @ this difference was not significant .
Result	At week @ , none of the laboratory values differed significantly compared with baseline .
Result	No significant differences were recorded between the two groups at any timepoint in proximal right coronary artery Z scores , age-adjusted haemoglobin values , duration of hospital stay , or any other laboratory markers of inflammation measured .
Result	No reactions to intravenous immunoglobulin infusion occurred in patients treated with infliximab compared with @ ( @ % ) patients given placebo ( p < @ ) .
Result	No serious adverse events were directly attributable to infliximab infusion .
Conclusion	The addition of infliximab to primary treatment in acute Kawasaki disease did not reduce treatment resistance .
Conclusion	However , it was safe and well tolerated and reduced fever duration , some markers of inflammation , left anterior descending coronary artery Z score , and intravenous immunoglobulin reaction rates .

Background	Secondary arm lymphoedema continues to affect at least @ % of women after treatment for breast cancer requiring lifelong professional treatment and self-management .
Background	The holistic practice of yoga may offer benefits as an adjunct self-management option .
Background	The aim of this small pilot trial was to gain preliminary data to determine the effect of yoga on women with stage one breast cancer-related lymphoedema ( BCRL ) .
Background	This paper reports the results for the primary and secondary outcomes .
Method	Participants were randomised , after baseline testing , to receive either an @-week yoga intervention ( n = @ ) , consisting of a weekly @-minute teacher-led class and a @-minute daily session delivered by DVD , or to a usual care wait-listed control group ( n = @ ) .
Method	Primary outcome measures were : arm volume of lymphoedema measured by circumference and extra-cellular fluid measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy .
Method	Secondary outcome measures were : tissue induration measured by tonometry ; levels of sensations , pain , fatigue , and their limiting effects all measured by a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and quality of life based on the Lymphoedema Quality of Life Tool ( LYMQOL ) .
Method	Measurements were conducted at baseline , week @ ( post-intervention ) and week @ ( four weeks after cessation of the intervention ) .
Result	At week @ , the intervention group had a greater decrease in tissue induration of the affected upper arm compared to the control group ( p = @ ) , as well as a greater reduction in the symptom sub-scale for QOL ( p = @ ) .
Result	There was no difference in arm volume of lymphoedema or extra-cellular fluid between groups at week @ ; however , at week @ , arm volume increased more for the intervention group than the control group ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	An @-week yoga intervention reduced tissue induration of the affected upper arm and decreased the QOL sub-scale of symptoms .
Conclusion	Arm volume of lymphoedema and extra-cellular fluid did not increase .
Conclusion	These benefits did not last on cessation of the intervention when arm volume of lymphoedema increased .
Conclusion	Further research trials with a longer duration , higher levels of lymphoedema and larger numbers are warranted before definitive conclusions can be made .

Problem	Enthusiasm for simulation early in cardiothoracic surgery training is growing , yet evidence demonstrating its utility is limited .
Problem	We examined the effect of supervised and unsupervised training on coronary anastomosis performance in a randomized trial among medical students .
Method	Forty-five medical students were recruited for this single-blinded , randomized controlled trial using a low-fidelity simulator .
Method	After viewing an instructional video , all participants attempted an anastomosis .
Method	Subsequently , the participants were randomized to @ of @ groups : control ( n = @ ) , unsupervised training ( n = @ ) , or supervised training with a cardiothoracic surgeon or fellow ( n = @ ) .
Method	Both the supervised and unsupervised groups practiced for @ hour per week .
Method	After @ weeks , the participants repeated the anastomosis .
Method	All pre - and posttraining performances were videotaped and rated independently by @ cardiothoracic surgeons blinded to the randomization .
Method	All raters scored @ assessment items on a @ to @ ( low-high ) scale along with an overall pass/fail rating .
Result	After the training period , all @ groups showed significant improvements in composite scores ( control : +@ @ -LSB- P = @ -RSB- , unsupervised : +@ @ -LSB- P < @ -RSB- , and supervised : +@ @ -LSB- P < @ -RSB- ) .
Result	Compared with control group , both supervised ( P = @ ) and unsupervised trainees ( P = @ ) demonstrated a significant improvement .
Result	Between the supervised and unsupervised groups there were no statistically significant differences in composite scores .
Conclusion	Practice on low-fidelity simulators enabled trainees to improve on a broad range of skills ; however , the additional effect of attending-level supervision is limited .
Conclusion	In an era of increasing staff surgeon responsibilities , unsupervised practice may be sufficient for inexperienced trainees .

Background	Despite numerous benefits of live donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) , patient-level barriers often prevent African Americans from considering LDKT .
Background	Educational interventions designed to address patient-level barriers may increase willingness among African American patients with end-stage renal disease to explore LDKT as a treatment option .
Problem	To assess the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive educational intervention called Living ACTS ( About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing ) that was designed to address patient-level barriers to LDKT among African American patients with end-stage renal disease .
Method	Patients were randomized to intervention ( n = @ ) or control ( n = @ ) groups .
Method	They completed baseline measures and then viewed either the Living ACTS or control video .
Method	Both groups then completed an immediate follow-up measure and a @-month assessment administered via telephone .
Method	Self-reported knowledge about LDKT , willingness to talk to the patient 's family about LDKT , and perceived benefits of LDKT were measured at @ time points .
Result	At @-month follow-up , intervention participants demonstrated a significantly greater increase in knowledge of LDKT than control participants ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Intervention participants expressed greater willingness to talk to patients ' families about LDKT than did control participants from baseline through @-month follow-up ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) .
Result	Finally , at immediate follow-up , intervention participants reported greater endorsement of the benefits of LDKT than did control participants ( F@ ,@ = @ , P < @ ) ; however , this effect had disappeared by the @-month follow-up .
Conclusion	Living ACTS is effective at increasing and maintaining knowledge about LDKT among African American patients with end-stage renal disease who are considering transplant .

Background	Excessive and inadequate gestational weight gain can complicate a woman 's pregnancy and put her and her child at risk for poor delivery and birth outcomes .
Background	Further , feeding and activity habits established early in life can significantly impact the development of childhood obesity .
Method	The on-going Delta Healthy Sprouts Project is a randomized , controlled , comparative trial testing the efficacy of two Maternal , Infant , and Early Childhood Home Visiting programs on weight status and health behaviors of @ mothers and their infants residing in the rural Mississippi Delta region of the United States .
Method	Women are enrolled in their second trimester of pregnancy and randomized to one of two treatment arms .
Method	The control arm curriculum is based on Parents as Teachers , an evidence based approach to increase parental knowledge of child development and improve parenting practices .
Method	The experimental arm , labeled Parents as Teachers Enhanced , builds upon the control curriculum by including culturally tailored nutrition and physical activity components specifically designed for the gestational and postnatal periods .
Method	We hypothesize that , as compared to the control arm , the experimental arm will be more effective in preventing inappropriate gestational weight gain , reducing postnatal weight retention , and decreasing infant obesity rates .
Method	We also will evaluate mother and child dietary and physical activity outcomes , breastfeeding initiation and continuation , and child feeding practices .
Conclusion	The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project tests a novel , combined approach to maternal weight management and childhood obesity prevention in pregnant women and their children at high risk for obesity and chronic disease .

Problem	This study aimed to assess the effects of sampling interval ( SI ) of computed tomographic ( CT ) perfusion acquisitions on CT perfusion values in normal liver and liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors .
Method	Computed tomographic perfusion in @ patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases was analyzed using distributed-parameter modeling to yield tissue blood flow , blood volume , mean transit time , permeability , and hepatic arterial fraction for tumor and normal liver .
Method	Computed tomographic perfusion values for the reference SI of @ s ( SI@ @ ) were compared with those of SI data sets of @ second , @ seconds , @ seconds , and @ seconds using mixed-effects model analyses .
Result	Increases in SI beyond @ second were associated with significant and increasing departures of CT perfusion parameters from the reference values at SI@ @ ( P @ ) .
Result	Computed tomographic perfusion values deviated from the reference with increasing uncertainty with increasing SIs .
Result	Findings for normal liver were concordant .
Conclusion	Increasing SIs beyond @ second yield significantly different CT perfusion parameter values compared with the reference values at SI@ @ .

Problem	Theory-based interventions to promote physical activity ( PA ) are more effective than atheoretical approaches ; however , the comparative utility of theoretical models is rarely tested in longitudinal designs with multiple time points .
Problem	Further , there is limited research that has simultaneously tested social-cognitive models with self-report and objective PA measures .
Problem	The primary aim of this study was to test the predictive ability of three theoretical models ( social cognitive theory , theory of planned behaviour , and protection motivation theory ) in explaining PA behaviour .
Method	Participants were adults with type @ diabetes ( n = @ , @ % males , mean age = @ @ years ) .
Method	Theoretical constructs across the three theories were tested to prospectively predict PA behaviour ( objective and self-report ) across three @-month time intervals ( baseline-@ , @-@ , @-@ months ) using structural equation modelling .
Method	PA outcomes were steps/@ days ( objective ) and minutes of MET-weighted PA/week ( self-report ) .
Result	The mean proportion of variance in PA explained by these models was @ % for objective PA and @ % for self-report PA. .
Result	Direct pathways to PA outcomes were stronger for self-report compared with objective PA. .
Conclusion	These theories explained a small proportion of the variance in longitudinal PA studies .
Conclusion	Theory development to guide interventions for increasing and maintaining PA in adults with type @ diabetes requires further research with objective measures .
Conclusion	Theory integration across social-cognitive models and the inclusion of ecological levels are recommended to further explain PA behaviour change in this population .
Conclusion	Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ?
Conclusion	Social-cognitive theories are able to explain partial variance for physical activity ( PA ) behaviour .
Conclusion	What does this study add ?
Conclusion	The testing of three theories in a longitudinal design over @ , @-month time intervals .
Conclusion	The parallel use and comparison of both objective and self-report PA measures in testing these theories .

Background	Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is commonly performed using a tourniquet .
Background	However , some studies have reported that several complications were associated with the use of a tourniquet in TKA .
Background	In this study we investigate whether the limited use of a tourniquet in TKA would reduce complications and facilitate postoperative recovery .
Method	Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups ( @ cases/group ) : group A using the tourniquet throughout the surgical procedure , and group B using the tourniquet starting from the cementation to the completion of the procedure .
Method	Operation time , total measured blood loss , and incidence of complications were all recorded .
Result	There was no significant difference in operation time , total measured blood loss , and hemoglobin concentration between the two groups .
Result	Incidence of postoperative complications in group B was significantly decreased in comparison to that in group A.
Result	The limb circumference at @ cm above the superior patellar pole or below the inferior patellar pole and the pain score in group B were significantly decreased compared with that in group A at any time point .
Result	Range of motion in group B was significantly increased at three and @ days postoperatively in comparison to that in group A.
Conclusion	The limited use of a tourniquet in TKA provides the benefit of decreased limb swelling and knee joint pain while not compromising the operation time or blood loss and recovery .
Method	Level I ( Therapeutic ) .

Problem	This study was to evaluate the effect of intraoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALRP ) in the steep Trendelenburg ( ST ) .
Method	Sixty-eight patients were randomly divided into two groups .
Method	The dexmedetomidine group ( Group D , n = @ ) received a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of @ g kg ( -@ ) hour ( -@ ) from the induction of anesthesia until the end of the ST position , while the control group ( Group C , n = @ ) received an equal volume of physiologic saline at the same rate under conventional general anesthesia with sevoflurane and remifentanil .
Method	IOP was measured at @ predefined time points for all patients .
Result	Significant differences in IOP were detected between the two groups by a linear mixed model analysis ( p < @ ) .
Result	The highest mean IOP was @ mm Hg in Group D and @ mm Hg in Group C ; both were measured @ minutes after the patients had been placed in the ST position .
Result	No significant between-group differences in ocular perfusion pressure , mean blood pressure , or heart rate were observed between the two groups .
Result	No ocular or other complications were noted .
Conclusion	Intraoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine may help alleviate IOP increase in patients undergoing RALRP in the ST position .

Problem	To compare the efficacy and safety of the intraocular lens ( IOL ) - shell procedure versus conventional phacoemulsification for the surgical treatment of dense cataracts .
Method	Eighty eyes with dense nuclear cataracts were enrolled in a prospective , randomized controlled study .
Method	Patients were assigned to two groups .
Method	In Group I , the IOL was traditionally implanted after all nuclear fragments were completely removed , and in Group II , the IOL was innovatively implanted in the bag before the last residual nuclear fragment was removed .
Method	This novel adjusted surgical procedure , named the `` IOL-shell technique '' , features use of the IOL as a protective barrier rather than simply as a refractive alternative , and it is conceptually different from the traditional step-by-step procedure .
Method	Clinical examinations , including uncorrected visual acuity , central corneal thickness ( CCT ) , temporal clear corneal incision thickness and corneal endothelial cell density , were carried out .
Result	The inter-group difference in temporal corneal thickness was found to be of no statistical significance at any of the visits .
Result	Compared to eyes in Group I , those in Group II were shown to have significantly less corneal endothelial cell loss on both the @th and @th day following surgery .
Result	At @ days after surgery , the mean corneal endothelial cell loss in Group II was @ % , compared to @ % in Group I ( P < @ ) .
Result	The mean endothelial cell loss measured on postoperative day @ was @ % in Group II compared to @ % in Group I ( P < @ ) .
Result	On the @st day after surgery , the mean CCT of eyes in Group II was significantly smaller compared to Group I ( Group I vs. Group II : @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Compared to conventional phacoemulsification , the IOL-shell technique was shown to be a relatively safer procedure without compromised efficiency for dense cataracts , and it caused less corneal endothelial cell loss and milder postoperative corneal edema ( Clinical Trials Identifier : NCT@ ) .

Problem	The goal of the study was to examine if intake of Lactobacillus plantarum can accelerate clearance of nontyphoid Salmonella and reduce infection-related symptoms .
Background	Nontyphoid Salmonella is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide .
Background	Few studies have explored the effect of probiotics in these infections .
Method	Patients with Salmonella infection were randomized to daily intake of @ @ colony forming units of freeze-dried Lactobacillus plantarum @ v or placebo .
Method	Symptoms were recorded daily .
Method	Feces were cultured weekly .
Method	Treatment continued until @ consecutive stool cultures negative for Salmonella had been obtained .
Result	The treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly with regard to time to clearance of Salmonella , or time to resolution of symptoms .
Result	Irrespective of treatment , women tended to clear Salmonella more rapidly than men ( @ vs. @ d , P = @ ) , despite a longer diarrheal phase ( @ vs. @ days after inclusion , P = @ ) .
Result	After Salmonella clearance ( postinfectious phase ) , women experienced loose stools , nausea , and flatulence more frequently than men .
Result	In women , L. plantarum treatment was associated with more abdominal pain , whereas in men L. plantarum treatment reduced the prevalence of hard stools , and increased the presence of diarrheal symptoms in the postinfectious phase .
Conclusion	Gender , but not administration of the probiotic strain L. plantarum @ v , may influence acute symptoms during Salmonella infection and possibly clearance of Salmonella .
Conclusion	Symptoms in the postinfectious phase were modified by the probiotics in a gender-specific way , but our results give little support for positive effects of L. plantarum @ v treatment in nontyphoid salmonellosis .

Problem	The aim of this study was to analyse effects of a comprehensive continuum of care ( intervention group ) on frail older persons ' life satisfaction , as compared to those receiving usual care ( control group ) .
Problem	The intervention included geriatric assessment , case management , interprofessional collaboration , support for relatives and organising of care-planning meetings in older persons ' own homes .
Background	Improvements in older persons ' subjective well-being have been shown in studies including care planning and coordination by a case manager .
Background	However , effects of more complex continuum of care interventions on frail older persons ' life satisfaction are not well explored .
Method	Randomised controlled study .
Method	The validated LiSat-@ scale was used in face-to-face interviews to assess older persons ' life satisfaction at baseline and at three , six and @ months after the baseline .
Method	The odds ratio for improving or maintaining satisfaction was compared for intervention and control groups from baseline to three-month , three - to six-month as well as six - to @-month follow-ups .
Result	Older persons who received the intervention were more likely to improve or maintain satisfaction than those who received usual care , between @ and @ month follow-ups , for satisfaction regarding functional capacity , psychological health and financial situation .
Conclusion	A comprehensive continuum of care intervention comprising several components had a positive effect on frail older persons ' satisfaction with functional capacity , psychological health and financial situation .
Conclusion	Frail older persons represent a great proportion of the persons in need of support from the health care system .
Conclusion	Health care professionals need to consider continuum of care interventions ' impact on life satisfaction .
Conclusion	As life satisfaction is an essential part of older persons ' well-being , we propose that policy makers and managers promote comprehensive continuum of care solutions .

Problem	It is recommended that treatments that include clarithromycin should be avoided in eradication of Helicobacter pylori ( HP ) in cases where clarithromycin resistance is higher than @ % .
Problem	We aimed to compare levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies with standard treatment and with each other in eradication of helicobacter pylori as first-line therapy .
Method	Patients were randomized prospectively as three groups .
Method	There were @ patients in the levofloxacin group , @ patients in the moxifloxacin group , and @ patients in the standard treatment group .
Method	The patients received levofloxacin @ mg daily , amoxicillin @ g b.i.d. and lansoprazole @ mg b.i.d. for ten days ( LAL ) in the levofloxacin group ; moxifloxacin @ mg daily , amoxicillin @ g b.i.d. and lansoprazole @ mg b.i.d. ( MAL ) in the moxifloxacin group ; and clarithromycin @ mg b.i.d. , amoxicillin @ g b.i.d. and lansoprazole @ mg b.i.d. ( CAL ) in the standard treatment group .
Method	At post-treatment week @ , HP was checked by using stool antigen test .
Result	In the eradication of Helicobacter pylori , the success rate as determined by per protocol ( PP ) analysis was @ % in the LAL group , @ % in the MAL group , and @ % in the CAL group .
Result	A statistically significant difference was found in the LAL and MAL groups compared to the CAL group ( p < @ ) .
Result	There was no difference between the LAL and MAL groups .
Conclusion	It was determined that levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies were more effective than the standard treatment in first-line setting in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori .
Conclusion	In addition , no difference was found between levofloxacin - and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies .
Conclusion	Currently observed high efficacy may be evaluated in treatment .
Conclusion	Although quinolon resistance is not considered a major problem , it appears to be a factor that may reduce treatment success over a period of time .

Background	PF-@ is a potent , selective phosphodiesterase @A ( PDE@A ) inhibitor that elevates guanoscine @ ' ,@ ' - cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP ) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid .
Background	PDE@A inhibition enhances synaptic plasticity and improves memory in preclinical cognition models , and prevents decreases in dendritic spine density in transgenic mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) leading to high levels of amyloid beta ( A ) production ( Tg@ ) .
Problem	This Phase @ multicenter study was designed to assess the efficacy , safety and pharmacokinetics of PF-@ compared with placebo in mild to moderate probable Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
Method	Subjects in overall good health with Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) scores of @-@ were randomized to @ weeks treatment with PF-@ @ mg q@h ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
Method	Concomitant acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine use was excluded .
Method	The primary outcome was the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale ( ADAS-cog ) .
Method	The Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ) and standard safety measures were secondary outcomes .
Result	Completion rates were similar , @ % PF-@ vs @ % placebo .
Result	At week @ the mean ( SE ) baseline adjusted decrease from baseline in ADAS cog for PF-@-treated patients was -@ ( @ ) .
Result	Placebo treated patients had a change of -@ ( @ ) .
Result	The difference between treatments was -@ ( @ % CI of -@ , @ ) .
Result	Corresponding values for the NPI were -@ ( @ ) vs -@ ( @ ) with a treatment difference of -@ ( @ % CI of -@ , @ ) .
Result	Neither these changes nor the distribution of CGI-I scores were statistically significantly different between groups .
Result	The incidence of serious adverse events ( AEs ) was similar between groups with @ deaths in the placebo group .
Result	The PF-@ group reported more gastrointestinal AEs including diarrhea ( @ % vs @ % ) and nausea ( @ % vs @ % ) and had a higher rate of discontinuation due to AEs ( @ % vs @ % ) .
Conclusion	Although generally safe and well-tolerated , @ weeks PF-@ treatment did not improve cognition , behavior , and global change compared with placebo .

Background	Clinical trials are increasingly being conducted as new products seek to enter the market .
Background	Deployment of such interventions is based on evidence obtained mainly from the gold standard of randomized controlled clinical trials ( RCCT ) .
Background	A crucial factor in the ability of RCCTs to provide credible and generalisable data is sample size and retention of the required number of subjects at completion of the follow-up period .
Background	However , recruitment and retention in clinical trials are hindered by prevalent peculiar challenges in Africa that need to be circumvented .
Background	This article shares experiences from a phase II trial that recorded a high retention rate at @ months follow-up at a new clinical trial site .
Method	Mothers bringing children less than two months of age to the health facility were given information and invited to have their child enrolled if the inclusion criteria were fulfilled .
Method	Participants were enrolled over @ months .
Method	Trial procedures , duration and risks/benefits were painstakingly and sequentially explained to the communities , parents and relevant relatives before and during the trial period .
Method	The proportions of participants that completed or did not complete the trial were analyzed including the reasons for failure to complete all trial procedures .
Result	@ individuals received information regarding the trial of which @ returned for screening .
Result	@ ( @ % ) of them who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria were enrolled and @ % of these completed the trial .
Result	Consent withdrawal was the main reason for not completing the trial largely ( @ % ) due to the father not being involved at the point of consenting or parents no longer being comfortable with blood sampling .
Conclusion	Participant retention in clinical trials remains a crucial factor in ensuring generalisability of trial data .
Conclusion	Appropriate measures to enhance retention should include continuous community involvement in the process , adequate explanation of trial procedures and risks/benefits ; and innovative tracing of participants adapted for the setting .

Problem	Periprosthetic bone cysts are a known finding after total ankle replacement ( TAR ) .
Problem	The significance of cysts is uncertain , but they may threaten the long-term survival of the implant .
Problem	The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of weight-bearing digital radiography compared with @D weight-bearing multiplanar reconstructed ( MPR ) fluoroscopic imaging when diagnosing periprosthetic bone cysts in patients who have undergone TAR .
Method	Forty-two consecutive patients with a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement ( STAR ) were consecutively enrolled and underwent digital radiography and @D MPR imaging in the same session .
Method	All @D MPR images were interpreted in a blinded fashion , specifically with regard to the presence and extent of periprosthetic bone cysts .
Method	Cysts were measured in three planes whenever possible .
Method	Interrater and intrarater reliability was assessed by using Cohen kappa test , and comparisons between the two modalities were performed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar tests .
Result	Significantly more cysts were detected on @D MPR ( @ vs @ ) ( p = @ ) , with the mean size of cysts detected by @D MPR significantly larger than that of cysts diagnosed on digital radiography ( @ mm ( @ ) vs @ mm ( @ ) ) ( p < @ ) .
Result	Statistical analysis based on the presence or absence of cysts in individual patients did not show a significant difference between @D MPR and digital radiography ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	The data imply that cysts are better detected and more accurately measured with @D fluoroscopic MPR imaging compared with digital radiography , which underestimates not only the presence but also the extent of periprosthetic cysts .

Background	Comparison of a multimodal intervention WE CALL ( study initiated phone support/information provision ) versus a passive intervention YOU CALL ( participant can contact a resource person ) in individuals with first mild stroke .
Result	This study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial .
Result	Primary outcome includes unplanned use of health services ( participant diaries ) for adverse events and quality of life ( Euroquol-@D , Quality of Life Index ) .
Result	Secondary outcomes include planned use of health services ( diaries ) , mood ( Beck Depression Inventory II ) , and participation ( Assessment of Life Habits -LSB- LIFE-H -RSB- ) .
Result	Blind assessments were done at baseline , @ , and @ months .
Result	A mixed model approach for statistical analysis on an intention-to-treat basis was used where the group factor was intervention type and occasion factor time , with a significance level of @ .
Result	We enrolled @ patients ( WE = @ ; YOU = @ ) with a mean age of @ @ years , and @ % were women .
Result	No significant differences were seen between groups at @ months for any outcomes with both groups improving from baseline on all measures ( effect sizes ranged from @ to @ ) .
Result	The only significant change for both groups from @ months to @ year ( n = @ ) was in the social domains of the LIFE-H ( increment in score , @ / @ @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ -RSB- ; effect size , @ ) .
Result	Qualitatively , the WE CALL intervention was perceived as reassuring , increased insight , and problem solving while decreasing anxiety .
Result	Only @ of @ ( @ % ) YOU CALL participants availed themselves of the intervention .
Conclusion	Although the @ groups improved equally over time , WE CALL intervention was perceived as helpful , whereas YOU CALL intervention was not used .

Background	Exacerbation of Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO ) after radioiodine ( RAI ) therapy has been examined in some populations but has not been fully described in Japanese populations .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of GO exacerbation after RAI therapy and the effectiveness of low-dose prophylactic corticosteroid ( PCS ) .
Method	This was a prospective randomized study in Tokyo , Japan .
Method	Between June @ and June @ , @ patients with Graves ' disease with either inactive GO or no GO received RAI therapy .
Method	Of these , @ received no PCS ( PCS-Off group ) , whereas @ received low-dose PCS ( starting dose , @ mg/day of prednisolone ) for @ weeks ( PCS-On group ) .
Method	We used magnetic resonance imaging to thoroughly evaluate GO before and @ year after RAI therapy .
Method	Outcomes of GO @ year after RAI therapy were determined .
Result	GO exacerbation occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) , and only @ patients ( @ % ) required ophthalmic treatment .
Result	No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups ( PCS-On group : n = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; PCS-Off group : n = @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
Result	Significant prognostic factors were identified as thyroid-stimulating antibody ( by @ % linear increase : risk ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and clinical activity score ( @ vs @ : risk ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Exacerbation of GO after RAI therapy in the Japanese population appears less common than in other populations .
Conclusion	Low-dose PCS did not produce a significant preventive effect and appeared insufficient .
Conclusion	Patients presenting with risk factors would thus be recommended to receive higher-dose PCS .

Problem	To compare the effects of a Chinese herbal suppository ( Jianpi suppository ) and Western Medicine ( mesalazine ) on hemorheology and CD@p in patients with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .
Method	In a randomized trial , @ mild to moderate UC patients were randomly divided into two equal groups .
Method	The Jianpi suppository group used Chinese herbal suppository rectally , while the mesalazine group was treated with mesalazine tablets orally .
Method	Two @-day courses of treatment were carried out in both groups .
Method	Changes in the hemorheology and CD@p indices in patients were observed .
Result	The hemorheology and CD@p indices in the Jianpi suppository group decreased significantly more than those of the mesalazine group .
Conclusion	Jianpi suppository is effective in improving the hypercoagulability of UC patients , and therefore may be worth using in clinical practice .

Problem	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of creatine loading and resistance training on the homocysteine and lipid profiles of young males .
Method	Sixty male University students ( @ @ years , @ @ m , @ @ kg , @ @ % body fat ) were randomly divided in to three groups ; control ( CG = @ ) , creatine supplement ( CEG = @ ) and placebo ( PEG = @ ) .
Method	Both CEG and PEG participated in a same resistance-training regimen and either taking a creatine supplement ( @ g/d for the first @ days followed @ g/d thereafter ) or the same amount of placebo for @ weeks .
Method	Participants in CG did not take any creatine supplementation and not engage any exercise program .
Method	After the body composition were assessed , the homocysteine ( Hcy ) concentrations , blood lipids , folic acid and vitamin B@ levels of all the participants were measured at the beginning and end of the eight weeks of resistance training .
Result	The analysis of the data indicated that the Hcy levels of the CEG after resistance training and receiving the creatine supplement ( @ @ ) was significantly lower than that of baseline ( @ @ ) measurements , F ( @,@ ) = @ , P = @ .
Result	No significant differences were seen in the Hcy levels of the PEG ( @ @ ) after @ weeks of training and receiving a placebo ( @ @ ) , F ( @,@ ) = @ , P = @ .
Result	Furthermore , there were no significant differences among groups in terms of Hcy levels , F ( @,@ ) = @ , P = @ .
Conclusion	The present study suggests that as well as strength gain ; creatine supplementation with resistance training may afford some protection against emerging cardiovascular risk factors .

Background	Microencapsulated sodium butyrate ( MSB ) has been previously associated with anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties regarding large bowel mucosa .
Background	We aimed to examine a role of MSB in patients with diverticulosis , hypothesizing its potential for reduction of diverticulitis episodes and diverticulitis prevention .
Method	Seventy-three patients with diverticulosis ( diagnosed in colonoscopy or/and barium enema or/and CT colography ) were recruited for the study and randomized .
Method	The investigated group was administered MSB @ mg daily ; the control group was administered placebo .
Method	After @ months , a total of @ patients completed the study and were subject to analysis ( @ subjects and @ controls ) .
Method	During the study , the number of episodes of diverticulitis ( symptomatic diagnosis with acute pain , fever , and leukocytosis ) , hospitalizations , and surgery performed for diverticulitis were recorded .
Method	Additionally , a question regarding subjective improvement of symptoms reflected changes in quality of life during the analysis .
Result	After @ months , the study group noted a significantly decreased number of diverticulitis episodes in comparison to the control group .
Result	The subjective quality of life in the study group was higher than in the control group .
Result	There were no side effects of the MSB during the therapy .
Conclusion	MSB reduces the frequency of diverticulitis episodes , is safe , and improves the quality of life .
Conclusion	It can play a role in the prevention of diverticulitis .

Problem	New models of health care delivery for dermatological care have the potential to increase access and improve patient-centered outcomes .
Problem	To compare effectiveness of a direct-access , online model for follow-up dermatologic care in pediatric and adult patients with atopic dermatitis with that of in-person office visits .
Method	This was a @-year , randomized controlled equivalency clinical trial in medically underserved areas , outpatient clinics , and the general community .
Method	Participants included children and adults with atopic dermatitis with access to the Internet , computers , and digital cameras .
Method	After an initial in-person visit , patients were randomized @:@ to direct-access online or usual in-person care for follow-up management of atopic dermatitis .
Method	In the direct-access online group , patients captured and transmitted clinical images and history asynchronously to dermatologists online ; dermatologists evaluated the clinical information , provided recommendations and education , and prescribed medications online asynchronously .
Method	In the in-person group , patients visited dermatologists in their offices for follow-up care .
Method	Atopic dermatitis disease severity as assessed by patient-oriented eczema measure ( POEM ) and investigator global assessment ( IGA ) .
Result	A total of @ children and adults were randomized .
Result	Between baseline and @ months , the mean ( SD ) within-group difference in POEM score in patients in the direct-access online group was -@ ( @ ) ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) ; in the in-person group , the within-group difference was -@ ( @ ) ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) .
Result	The difference in the change in POEM scores between the @ groups was @ ( @ ) ( @ % CI , -@ to @ ) , which was contained within the predetermined @ equivalence margin .
Result	The percentage of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance of their disease ( IGA score of @ or @ ) was @ % ( @ % CI , @ % to @ % ) in the direct-access online group and @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) in the in-person group .
Result	The difference in the percent of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance between the @ groups was @ % ( @ % CI , @ % -@ % ) , which was contained within the predetermined @ % equivalence margin .
Conclusion	The direct-access online model results in equivalent improvements in atopic dermatitis clinical outcomes as in-person care .
Conclusion	Direct-access online care may represent an innovative model of delivering dermatological services to patients with chronic skin diseases .

Problem	The therapeutic outcomes of low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) on closed bone fractures ( CBFs ) in the wrist and hand were investigated in this controlled study .
Background	Animal research has confirmed that LLLT increases osteocyte quantity ; however , little research has been conducted to determine the effect of LLLT on the treatment of human bone fractures .
Method	In this study , the therapeutic outcomes of administering @nm LLLT to treat CBFs in the wrist or hand were examined .
Method	Fifty patients with CBFs in the wrist and hand , who had not received surgical treatment , were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups .
Method	The laser group underwent a treatment program in which @nm LLLT ( average power @mW , peak power @W , @Hz , @sec , and @ J/cm ( @ ) per fracture site ) was administered five times per week for @ weeks .
Method	Participants in a placebo group received sham laser treatment .
Method	The pain , functional disability , grip strength , and radiographic parameters of the participants were evaluated before and after treatment and at a @-week follow-up .
Result	After treatment and at the follow-up , the laser group exhibited significant changes in all of the parameters compared with the baseline ( p < @ ) .
Result	The results of comparing the two groups after treatment and at the follow-up indicated significant between-group differences among all of the parameters ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	LLLT can relieve pain and improve the healing process of CBFs in the human wrist and hand .

Problem	Most blood donors stop donating blood at the beginning of their donor career .
Problem	This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques .
Method	Newly registered donors ( N = @ ) received an extra information sheet during their medical check-up wherein implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques were tested .
Method	Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition , information sheet only condition , information sheet with implementation intentions condition , information sheet with explicit commitment condition , or information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition .
Method	Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood .
Result	Donors in the information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition had an @ % higher return rate than donors in the control condition .
Result	Logistic regression analyses revealed that the information sheet with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition ( OR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques .

Background	Faecal short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) are produced by the gut microflora .
Background	We have previously reported high faecal SCFA levels in children with coeliac disease ( CD ) , indicating alteration in gut microfloral metabolism .
Background	Data accumulated over recent decades by us and others suggest that wheat-free oats can safely be included in a gluten-free diet ( GFD ) .
Background	However , concerns have been raised with respect to the safety of oats in a subset of coeliacs .
Problem	To describe faecal SCFA patterns in children with newly diagnosed CD treated for @ year with a GFD with or without oats .
Method	This report is part of a randomised , double-blind study on the effect of a GFD containing oats ( GFD-oats ) vs. a standard GFD ( GFD-std ) .
Method	Faecal samples were received from @ children in the GFD-oats group and @ in the GFD-std group at initial diagnosis and/or after @ year on a GFD .
Method	Faecal SCFAs were analysed .
Result	The GFD-std group had a significantly lower total faecal SCFA concentration at @ months compared with @ months ( P < @ ) .
Result	In contrast , total SCFA in the GFD-oats group remained high after @ year on the GFD .
Result	The children in the GFD-oats group had significantly higher acetic acid ( P < @ ) , n-butyric acid ( P < @ ) and total SCFA concentration ( P < @ ) after @-year diet treatment compared to the GFD-std group .
Conclusion	Our results indicate that oats do affect the gut microflora function , and that some coeliac children receiving oats may develop gut mucosal inflammation , that may present a risk for future complications .

Problem	Children born prematurely who develop retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ) often develop myopia , and those who require laser treatment may develop very high myopia , which has considerable clinical consequences .
Problem	To report refractive outcomes in preterm infants who developed ROP in zone I or zone II posterior as stage @ + ROP or aggressive posterior ROP ( APROP ) .
Method	All infants received intravitreal bevacizumab or laser therapy in a prospective , stratified , randomized , controlled , masked , multicenter clinical trial , Bevacizumab Eliminates the Angiogenic Threat for ROP ( BEAT-ROP ) .
Method	Children who received intravitreal bevacizumab or laser in the BEAT-ROP clinical trial , with treatment randomized by infant , underwent cycloplegic retinoscopic refraction at a mean age of @ years .
Method	Fifteen centers with both pediatric and vitreoretinal ophthalmologists participating in level @ neonatal intensive care units in academic centers with institutional review board approval were included in the trial .
Method	Of the originally enrolled @ infants ( @ eyes ) in the BEAT-ROP clinical trial , @ infants ( @ eyes ) died ( @ received intravitreal bevacizumab ; @ received laser ) and @ eyes had intraocular surgery ( @ infants bilaterally ) .
Method	Thus , @ eyes ( @ infants bilaterally ) were excluded , leaving @ infants ( @ eyes , including @ eyes that received a successful second treatment for recurrence ) .
Method	Follow-up of the BEAT-ROP cohort .
Method	Spherical equivalent refractive outcomes and their distribution by ROP zone and treatment .
Result	Refractions were available for @ of @ eligible infants ( @ % ) and @ of @ eyes ( @ % ) .
Result	Mean ( SD ) spherical equivalent refractions were as follows : zone I , -@ ( @ ) diopters ( D ) in @ eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and -@ ( @ ) D in @ eyes that received laser treatment ( P < @ ) ; and zone II posterior , -@ ( @ ) D in @ eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and -@ ( @ ) D in @ eyes that received laser treatment ( P < @ ) .
Result	Very high myopia ( -@ D ) occurred in zone I in @ of @ ( @ % ) eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and in @ of @ ( @ % ) eyes that received laser treatment ( P < @ ) .
Result	Very high myopia occurred in zone II posterior in @ of @ ( @ % ) eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab and in @ of @ ( @ % ) eyes that received laser treatment ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	More very high myopia was found in eyes that received laser treatment than in eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab .
Conclusion	This difference is possibly related to anterior segment development that is present with intravitreal bevacizumab but minimal or absent following laser treatment .

Background	The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of rectus sheath block combined with intraperitoneal instillation using two doses of ropivacaine in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery .
Method	Altogether @ consenting women were randomized to receive intraperitoneal infiltration with @ % ropivacaine or @ % ropivacaine followed by rectus sheath block with @ % ropivacaine .
Method	The outcomes of clinical safety were measured using plasma concentration of local anesthetics and occurrence of toxic symptoms .
Method	The analgesic efficacy was assessed using numerical rating scales for pain and morphine consumption up to @ hours after surgery .
Result	Patients ' baseline characteristics , surgical factors , and analgesic outcomes were comparable between the two groups .
Result	Although peak plasma concentration of ropivacaine was significantly higher in patients receiving @ % ropivacaine , none of analyzed concentrations was above the toxic ones .
Result	Besides , no patients showed any symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity .
Conclusion	The present study showed that the combination of rectus sheath block with intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine was safe and potent enough to relieve pain after laparoscopic surgery .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to test causal effects of physicians ' nonverbal involvement on medical error disclosure outcomes .
Method	@ hospital outpatients were randomly assigned to two experimental treatment groups .
Method	The first group watched a video vignette of a verbally effective and nonverbally involved error disclosure .
Method	The second group was exposed to a verbally effective but nonverbally uninvolved error disclosure .
Method	All patients responded to seven outcome measures .
Result	Patients in the nonverbally uninvolved error disclosure treatment group perceived the physician 's apology as less sincere and remorseful compared to patients in the involved disclosure group .
Result	They also rated the implications of the error as more severe , were more likely to ascribe fault to the physician , and indicated a higher intent to change doctors after the disclosure .
Conclusion	The results of this study imply that nonverbal involvement during medical error disclosures facilitates more accurate patient understanding and assessment of the medical error and its consequences on their health and quality of life .
Conclusion	In the context of disclosing medical errors , nonverbal involvement increases the likelihood that physicians will be able to continue caring for their patient .
Conclusion	Thus , providers are advised to consider adopting this communication skill into their medical practice .

Problem	Active immunization , or vaccination , with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - Kinoid ( TNF-K ) is a novel approach to induce polyclonal anti-TNF antibodies in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases .
Problem	This study was performed to transfer the proof of concept obtained in mice model of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) into human .
Problem	We designed a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic vaccination in RA .
Method	This was a phase IIa , placebo-controlled , multicenter study in adults with RA who previously experienced secondary failure of TNF antagonists .
Method	Patients were immunized intramuscularly with @ or @ doses of placebo ( n = @ ) or @ ( n = @ ) , @ ( n = @ ) , or @ g TNF-K ( n = @ ) .
Method	The primary objective was to identify the best dose and schedule based on anti-TNF antibody titers .
Method	Clinical symptoms and safety were assessed during @ months and solicited reactions for @ days after each injection .
Result	The highest anti-TNF antibody response was detected in patients immunized with @ g TNF-K and with @ injections , although this difference was not significant with all other groups .
Result	Similar proportions of patients receiving TNF-K and placebo reported adverse events up to month @ .
Result	Serious adverse events were reported by @ patients treated with TNF-K ( @ % ) and @ treated with placebo ( @ % ) , all unrelated to treatment .
Result	At month @ , DAS@-CRP , tender and swollen joint counts , and HAQ scores decreased significantly more in patients who exhibited anti-TNF antibody response than in patients who did not .
Conclusion	TNF-K therapeutic vaccination induced dose - and schedule-dependent anti-TNF antibodies in RA patients and was well tolerated .
Conclusion	Patients who developed anti-TNF antibodies showed a trend toward clinical improvement .
Conclusion	Although the most aggressive dose and schedule , i.e. @ mg dose administered @ times , did show a strong trend of higher antibody response , further studies are warranted to examine even higher and more frequent doses in order to establish the best conditions for clinical improvement .
