Problem	To describe the incidence and outcomes of reoperations for glaucoma in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( TVT ) Study .
Method	Cohort study of patients in a multicenter randomized clinical trial .
Method	The TVT Study enrolled @ patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma who had previous cataract and/or glaucoma surgery .
Method	Randomization assigned @ patients to surgery with a tube shunt ( @ mm ( @ ) Baerveldt glaucoma implant ) and @ patients to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C ( @ mg/mL for @ minutes ) .
Method	Data were analyzed from patients who failed their assigned treatment and had additional glaucoma surgery .
Method	Outcome measures included intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , use of glaucoma medications , visual acuity , surgical complications , and failure ( IOP > @ mm Hg or not reduced by @ % , IOP @ mm Hg , additional glaucoma surgery , or loss of light perception vision ) .
Result	Additional glaucoma surgery was performed in @ patients in the tube group and @ patients in the trabeculectomy group in the TVT Study , and the @-year cumulative reoperation rate was @ % in the tube group and @ % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Follow-up ( mean SD ) after additional glaucoma surgery was @ @ months in the tube group and @ @ months in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Result	At @ years after a glaucoma reoperation , IOP ( mean SD ) was @ @ mm Hg in the tube group and @ @ mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Result	The number of glaucoma medications ( mean SD ) after @ years of follow-up was @ @ in the tube group and @ @ in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Result	The cumulative probability of failure at @ , @ , @ , and @ years after additional glaucoma surgery was @ % , @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively , in the tube group , and @ % , @ % , @ % , and @ % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Reoperations to manage complications were required in @ patient in the tube group and @ patients in the trabeculectomy group ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The rate of reoperation for glaucoma was higher following trabeculectomy with mitomycin C than tube shunt surgery in the TVT Study .
Conclusion	Similar surgical outcomes were observed after additional glaucoma surgery , irrespective of initial randomized treatment in the study .

Problem	Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is common in dialysis patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality .
Problem	The pathophysiology may be related to common risk factors for both AF and renal disease or to dialysis-specific factors .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how AF onset relates to the dialysis procedure itself .
Method	All dialysis patients enrolled in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator-@ ( ICD-@ ) trial until January @ , who were implanted with an ICD , were included in this study .
Method	Using the ICD remote monitoring function , the exact time of onset of all AF episodes was registered .
Method	Subsequently , this was linked to the timing of dialysis procedures .
Result	For the current study , a total of @ patients were included , follow-up was @ @ months , @ % male , @ @ years old .
Result	A total of @ episodes of AF were monitored in @ patients .
Result	AF onset was more frequent on the days of haemodialysis ( HD ) ( p < @ ) and specifically increased during the dialysis procedure itself ( p = @ ) .
Result	Patients with AF had a larger left atrium ( p < @ ) and a higher systolic blood pressure before and after HD ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	This study provides insight in the exact timing of AF onset in relation to the dialysis procedure itself .
Conclusion	In HD patients , AF occurred significantly more often on a dialysis day and especially during HD .
Conclusion	These findings might help to elucidate some aspects of the pathophysiology of AF in dialysis patients and could facilitate early detection of AF in these high-risk patients .

Background	The International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements Project developed a small-quantity ( @ g/d ) lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNS ) for pregnant and lactating women .
Problem	We evaluated the effects of prenatal LNS supplementation on fetal growth .
Method	In a community-based , partially double-blind , individually randomized controlled trial , @ women @ wk pregnant received @ mg Fe/@ g folic acid ( IFA ) , or @-@ Recommended Dietary Allowances of @ micronutrients , including @ mg Fe ( MMN ) , or LNS with the same micronutrients as the MMN group , plus @ minerals and macronutrients contributing @ kcal ( LNS ) daily until delivery .
Method	Fetal growth was compared across groups by using intention-to-treat analysis .
Method	The primary outcome was birth length .
Result	This analysis included @ women ( IFA = @ , MMN = @ , LNS = @ ) .
Result	Groups did not differ significantly in mean birth length , length-for-age z score ( LAZ ) , head circumference , or percentage low birth length but differed in mean birth weight ( P = @ ) , weight-for-age z score ( WAZ ; P = @ ) , and BMI-for-age z score ( BMIZ ; P = @ ) , with a trend toward differences in low birth weight ( P = @ ) .
Result	In pairwise comparisons , the LNS group had greater mean birth weight ( +@ g ; P = @ ) , WAZ ( +@ ; P = @ ) , and BMIZ ( +@ ; P = @ ) and a lower risk of low birth weight ( RR : @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ; P = @ ) than did the IFA group .
Result	The other group differences were not significant .
Result	The effect of intervention was modified by mother 's parity , age , height , baseline hemoglobin , household food insecurity , and child sex , with parity being the most consistent modifier .
Result	Among primiparous women ( IFA = @ ; MMN = @ ; LNS = @ ) , the LNS group had greater mean birth length ( +@ cm ; P = @ ) , LAZ ( +@ ; P = @ ) , weight ( +@ g ; P < @ ) , WAZ ( +@ ; P < @ ) , BMIZ ( +@ ; P < @ ) , head circumference ( @ cm ; P = @ ) , and head circumference-for-age z score ( +@ ; P = @ ) than did the IFA group ; similar differences were found when comparing the LNS and MMN groups among primiparous women , and no group differences were found among multiparous women .
Conclusion	Prenatal LNS supplementation can improve fetal growth among vulnerable women in Ghana , particularly primiparous women .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Background	Health-related quality of life is often collected in clinical studies , and forms a cornerstone of economic evaluation .
Background	This study had two objectives , firstly to report and compare pre - and post-progression health state utilities in advanced melanoma when valued by different methods and secondly to explore the validity of progression-based health state utility modelling compared to modelling based upon time to death .
Method	Utilities were generated from the ipilimumab MDX@-@ trial ( Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT@ ) using the condition-specific EORTC QLQ-C@ ( via the EORTC-@D ) and generic SF-@v@ ( via the SF-@D ) preference-based measures .
Method	Analyses by progression status and time to death were conducted on the patient-level data from the MDX@-@ trial using generalised estimating equations fitted in Stata , and the predictive abilities of the two approaches compared .
Result	Mean utility showed a decrease on disease progression in both the EORTC-@D ( @ to @ ) and the SF-@D ( @ to @ ) .
Result	Whilst higher utilities were obtained using the EORTC-@D , the relative decrease in utility on progression was similar between measures .
Result	When analysed by time to death , both EORTC-@D and SF-@D showed a large decrease in utility in the @ days prior to death ( from @ to @ and from @ to @ , respectively ) .
Result	Compared to progression status alone , the use of time to death gave similar or better estimates of the original data when used to predict patient utility in the MDX@-@ study .
Result	Including both progression status and time to death further improved model fit .
Result	Utilities seen in MDX@-@ were also broadly comparable with those seen in the literature .
Conclusion	Patient-level utility data should be analysed prior to constructing economic models , as analysis solely by progression status may not capture all predictive factors of patient utility and time to death may , as death approaches , be as or more important .
Conclusion	Additionally this study adds to the body of evidence showing that different scales lead to different health state values .
Conclusion	Further research is needed on how different utility instruments ( the SF-@D , EORTC-@D and EQ-@D ) relate to each other in different disease areas .

Background	The relationship between tobacco and cannabis use is strong .
Background	When co-smokers try to quit only one substance , this relationship often leads to a substitution effect , that is , the increased use of the remaining substance .
Background	Stopping the use of both substances simultaneously is therefore a reasonable strategy , but co-smokers rarely report feeling ready for simultaneous cessation .
Background	Thus , the question of how co-smokers can be motivated to attempt a simultaneous cessation has arisen .
Background	To reach as many co-smokers as possible , we developed brief Web-based interventions aimed at enhancing the readiness to simultaneously quit tobacco and cannabis use .
Problem	Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of three different Web-based interventions designed to enhance co-smokers ' readiness to stop tobacco and cannabis use simultaneously .
Method	Within a randomized trial , three brief Web-based and fully automated interventions were compared .
Method	The first intervention combined the assessment of cigarette dependence and problematic cannabis use with personalized , normative feedback .
Method	The second intervention was based on principles of motivational interviewing .
Method	As an active psychoeducational control group , the third intervention merely provided information on tobacco , cannabis , and the co-use of the two substances .
Method	The readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously was measured before and after the intervention ( both online ) and @ weeks later ( online or over the phone ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes included the frequency of cigarette and cannabis use , as measured at baseline and after @ weeks .
Result	A total of @ website users were assessed for eligibility based on their self-reported tobacco and cannabis co-use , and @ participants were ultimately randomized and analyzed .
Result	For the post-intervention assessment , generalized estimating equations revealed a significant increase in the readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis in the total sample ( B = @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Result	However , this effect was not significant for the comparison between baseline and the @-week follow-up assessment ( P = @ ) .
Result	Furthermore , no differential effects between the interventions were found , nor were any significant intervention or time effects found on the frequency of tobacco or cannabis use .
Conclusion	In the new field of dual interventions for co-smokers of tobacco and cannabis , Web-based interventions can increase the short-term readiness to quit tobacco and cannabis simultaneously .
Conclusion	The studied personalized techniques were no more effective than was psychoeducation .
Conclusion	The analyzed brief interventions did not change the secondary outcomes , that is the frequency of tobacco and cannabis use .

Problem	To identify risk factors for headache and migraine in children with sickle cell disease and test the hypothesis that either or both are independently associated with silent cerebral infarcts .
Method	In this cross-sectional study , we evaluated the health history , laboratory values , and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings of participants with sickle cell disease ( hemoglobinSS or hemoglobinS-thalassemia ) with no history of overt stroke or seizures .
Method	Participants characterized headache severity and quality .
Method	Migraine was defined by International Headache Society criteria modified for increased sensitivity in children .
Method	Neuroradiology and neurology committees adjudicated the presence of silent cerebral infarction by review of magnetic resonance imaging and standardized examination by pediatric neurologists .
Result	The cohort included @ children ( @ % males ) , ranging in age from @ to @ years ( mean age , @ years ) .
Result	Of these children , @ ( @ % ) reported recurrent headaches , and @ ( @ % ) reported migraines .
Result	In multivariable logistic regression analyses , both were associated with lower steady-state hemoglobin ( P = @ for headaches ; P < @ for migraines ) and higher pain rate ( P < @ for headaches ; P < @ for migraines ) , defined as the number of admissions requiring opioids in the previous @ years .
Result	The presence of silent cerebral infarction was not associated with recurrent headaches or migraines .
Result	Only @ % ( @ of @ ) of children with recurrent headaches received medication for headache prophylaxis .
Conclusion	Recurrent headaches and migraines are common and undertreated in children with sickle cell disease .
Conclusion	Low hemoglobin levels and high pain rates are associated with recurrent headaches and migraines ; whereas , silent cerebral infarction is not .

Background	Antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) is a severe form of rejection , mediated primarily by antibody-dependent complement ( C ) activation .
Background	C@ inhibitor ( C@-INH , Berinert ) inhibits the classical and lectin pathways of C activation .
Background	We performed a randomized , placebo-controlled study using C@-INH in highly sensitized renal transplant recipients for prevention of AMR .
Method	Twenty highly sensitized patients desensitized with IVIG + rituximabplasma exchange were enrolled and randomized @:@ to receive plasma-derived human C@-INH ( @ IU/kg/dose ) versus placebo intraoperatively , then twice weekly for @ doses .
Method	Renal function , adverse events ( AEs ) / serious AEs , C@ , C@ , and C@-INH levels were monitored and C@q + HLA antibodies were also blindly assessed .
Result	One patient in the C@-INH group versus @ patients in the placebo group developed serious AEs , but none were related to study drug .
Result	Delayed graft function developed in @ C@-INH subject and @ in the placebo .
Result	The C@-INH trough levels increased with C@-INH treatment .
Result	C@ and C@ levels also increased significantly in the C@-INH group compared to placebo .
Result	No C@-INH patient developed AMR during the study .
Result	Two patients developed AMR after the study .
Result	Three placebo patients developed AMR , one during the study .
Result	C@q + donor specific antibodies were reduced in @ C@-INH treated patients tested , while immunoglobulin G DSA levels showed decreased binding for both groups .
Conclusion	The C@-INH appears safe in the posttransplant period .
Conclusion	The C@-INH treatment may reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury .
Conclusion	The C@-INH also resulted in significant elevations of C@-INH levels , C@ , C@ , and reduced C@q + HLA antibodies .
Conclusion	Taken together , the combination of antibody reduction and C@-INH may prove useful in prevention of AMR .
Conclusion	Further controlled studies are warranted .

Problem	We investigated atorvastatin reloading effects on endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) count and inflammatory cytokine expression after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) in patients with stable angina pectoris who had previously received long-term statin treatments .
Method	Patients with stable angina pectoris were treated with @ mg atorvastatin @ hours and @ mg atorvastatin @ hours before coronary angioplasty ( n = @ ) or preoperatively with @ mg/d atorvastatin for @ days ( n = @ ) or did not receive atorvastatin ( n = @ ) .
Method	CD@ - / @ + / @ + , CD@ - / CD@ + / kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) + , and CD@ - / CD@ + / KDR + EPCs in the peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry @ hour before as well as @ hour , @ hours , and @ hours after PCI .
Method	Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule @ ( sICAM-@ ) , hypersensitive C-reactive protein ( hCRP ) , and troponin-I ( TnI ) serum concentrations were analyzed immediately prior to and @ hours after PCI .
Result	In the @mg Atorvastatin and control groups , none of the analyzed EPC blood concentrations changed significantly from @h before operation to @h and @ h postoperative values .
Result	In contrast , the number of circulating early differentiation stage EPCs CD@ - / @ + / @ + and CD@ - / CD@ + / KDR + raised significantly from @ h preoperative values ( @ ; @ @ ) to @ h postoperative ( ( @ @ ; @ @ ) , ( p < @ ) ) and @ h postoperative ( ( @ @ ; @ @ ) , ( p < @ ) ) concentrations after coronary angioplasty in the @mg Atorvastatin medication patients .
Result	In the control group , the sICAM-@ ( @ @ vs @ @ ) and hCRP ( @ @ vs @ @ ) serum concentrations at @ hours after PCI were significantly elevated ( P < @ ) compared to preoperative values , whereas the increases in the @ groups treated with atorvastatin were not significant .
Result	In addition , the rise in serum TnI concentration level from pre - to postoperative in the @-mg ( @ @ vs @ @ ) and the @-mg ( @ @ vs @ @ ) reloading groups was less than that of the controls ( @ @ vs @ @ ) ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our results suggested that high-dose atorvastatin application before PCI triggered early EPC circulation .
Conclusion	Furthermore , postoperative inflammatory cytokine sICAM-@ as well as hCRP serum levels were reduced , while postinterventional myocardial injury marker TnI elevations were inversely correlated with statin reloadings .

Background	Neuroendocrine and immune stresses imposed by chronic sleep restriction are known to be involved in the harmful cardiovascular effects associated with poor sleep .
Problem	Despite a well-known beneficial effect of napping on alertness , its effects on neuroendocrine stress and immune responses after sleep restriction are largely unknown .
Method	This study was a strictly controlled ( sleep-wake status , light environment , caloric intake ) , crossover , randomized design in continuously polysomnography-monitored subjects .
Method	The study was conducted in a laboratory-based study .
Method	The subjects were @ healthy young men .
Method	We investigated the effects on neuroendocrine and immune biomarkers of a night of sleep restricted to @ h followed by a day without naps or with @ minute morning and afternoon naps , both conditions followed by an ad libitum recovery night starting at @:@ .
Method	Salivary interleukin-@ and urinary catecholamines were assessed throughout the daytime study periods .
Result	The increase in norepinephrine values seen at the end of the afternoon after the sleep-restricted night was not present when the subjects had the opportunity to take naps .
Result	Interleukin-@ changes observed after sleep deprivation were also normalized after napping .
Result	During the recovery day in the no-nap condition , there were increased levels of afternoon epinephrine and dopamine , which was not the case in the nap condition .
Result	A recovery night after napping was associated with a reduced amount of slow-wave sleep compared to after the no-nap condition .
Conclusion	Our data suggest that napping has stress-releasing and immune effects .
Conclusion	Napping could be easily applied in real settings as a countermeasure to the detrimental health consequences of sleep debt .

Background	Vertigo imposes considerable health restrictions with significant impact on the patient 's quality of life .
Background	The most effective antivertigo agent is undetermined thus far .
Problem	This study was performed to assess whether promethazine has superior vertigo reduction compared with lorazepam in ED patients .
Method	In this randomized , double-blind , parallel group trial @ patients were assigned ( @:@ ratio ) to receive either promethazine , @ mg intravenously , or lorazepam , @ mg intravenously .
Method	Primary endpoint was mean change in vertigo intensity at @ hours measured using visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
Method	Secondary endpoints were mean change in nausea score , need for second dose of study medications , and adverse events ( AEs ) .
Result	Promethazine was associated with significantly more reduction ( @ mm ) in vertigo than lorazepam ( @ mm , p < @ ) .
Result	Mean change in nausea score @ hours after drug injection on the VAS was @ mm for promethazine and @ for lorazepam ( p = @ ) .
Result	The most frequently reported AEs were lethargy ( @ % in lorazepam group , @ % in promethazine group , p = @ ) and drowsiness ( @ % for promethazine , @ % for lorazepam , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Our study demonstrated the evidence that promethazine is superior to lorazepam in management of peripheral vertigo and vertigo-related nausea in ED adults .

Problem	To volumetrically evaluate soft tissue changes of different ridge preservation techniques compared to spontaneous healing @months after tooth extraction .
Method	In each of @ patients , one single-rooted tooth was extracted and four treatment modalities were randomly assigned to the following groups ( n = @ each ) : A ) - tricalcium-phosphate-particles with a polylactid coating ( - TCP ) , B ) demineralized bovine bone mineral with @ % collagen covered with a collagen matrix ( DBBM-C/CM ) , C ) DBBM with @ % collagen covered with an autogenous soft tissue punch graft ( DBBM-C/PG ) , D ) spontaneous healing ( control ) .
Method	Impressions were obtained before extraction and @months later , casts were digitized and volumetric changes at the buccal soft tissues were determined .
Method	One-way anova was performed and pair-wise Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni-Holm method was applied for comparison of differences between two groups .
Result	After @months , horizontal contour changes accounted for -@ mm ( A ) , -@ mm ( B ) , -@ mm ( C ) and -@ mm ( D ) .
Result	None of the group comparisons reached statistical significance .
Conclusion	Six months after tooth extraction all groups revealed a horizontal volume change in the buccal soft tissue contour .
Conclusion	Application of DBBM-C/CM or DBBM-C/PG reduced the amount of volume resorption compared to - TCP or spontaneous healing without reaching statistically significant difference .

Background	The efficacy of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in young children is considered to be suboptimal .
Background	This study compared the safety and immunogenicity profiles of MF@-adjuvanted , trivalent , influenza vaccine ( ATIV ) and non-adjuvanted , trivalent , influenza vaccine ( TIV ) in Guatemalan children ( N = @ ) between @ and < @ months of age .
Method	Children received two doses of ATIV or TIV administered four weeks apart .
Method	Solicited adverse reactions were recorded for seven days after each vaccination .
Method	Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the entire study period .
Method	Antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) assay at baseline , four weeks after administration of the first vaccine dose , and three weeks after administration of the second dose .
Result	Both ATIV and TIV were well tolerated , with similar rates of solicited reactions and adverse events observed in response to both vaccines .
Result	MF@-adjuvanted vaccine induced considerably higher antibody titers than did TIV .
Result	After two doses , the B strain-specific antibody response to TIV was insufficient to meet the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) licensure criterion for seroprotection , whereas responses to the MF@-adjuvanted vaccine met the seroprotection criterion against all three strains .
Result	Cross-reactive antibody responses to MF@-adjuvanted vaccine met the CBER seroprotection criterion against all three strains after two doses ; B strain-specific heterologous responses to non-adjuvanted TIV were inadequate .
Conclusion	The MF@-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in children @ to < @ months of age , inducing seroprotective antibody titers against both the vaccine strains and antigenically distinct heterologous strains .

Problem	To determine the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention versus a comparison group on body composition in obese or overweight persons with type @ diabetes at baseline and at @ , @ , and @ years .
Method	Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a subset of @ Look AHEAD study volunteers randomized to intervention or comparison groups .
Method	The intervention was designed to achieve and maintain @ % weight loss through increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake .
Method	The comparison group received social support and diabetes education .
Result	At @ year , the intervention group lost fat ( @ kg ) and lean mass ( @ kg ) but regained fat ( @ % ) and lost lean mass between years @ and @ .
Result	Between baseline and year @ , weight loss was greater in intervention versus comparison groups ( @ vs. @ kg ) ; comparison group weight loss was mostly lean mass ( @ kg ) .
Result	Fat mass in the intervention group was lower than that of the comparison group at all post-baseline time points .
Conclusion	Reduced fat mass may place the intervention group at a lower risk of obesity-linked sequelae , a hypothesis that can be tested by future studies of this cohort .

Background	Severe anaemia in children is a leading cause of hospital admission and a major cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa , yet there are limited published data on blood transfusion in this vulnerable group .
Method	We present data from a large controlled trial of fluid resuscitation ( Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy ( FEAST ) trial ) on the prevalence , clinical features , and transfusion management of anaemia in children presenting to hospitals in three East African countries with serious febrile illness ( predominantly malaria and/or sepsis ) and impaired peripheral perfusion .
Result	Of @,@ children in the FEAST trial , @,@ ( @ % ) had baseline haemoglobin ( Hb ) measurement , @,@ / @,@ ( @ % ) were anaemic ( Hb < @ g/dL ) , and @ % severely anaemic ( Hb < @ g/dL ) .
Result	Prevalence of severe anaemia varied from @ % in Kenya to @ % in eastern Uganda .
Result	@,@ / @,@ ( @ % ) children were transfused ( @ % within @ hours ) .
Result	Adherence to WHO transfusion guidelines was poor .
Result	Among severely anaemic children who were not transfused , @ % ( @/@ ) died within @ hours , and @ % of these deaths occurred within @ hours of randomisation .
Result	By @ hours , @/@ ,@ ( @ % ) severely anaemic children had died , compared to @/@ ( @ % ) and @/@ ( @ % ) of those with moderate and mild anaemia , respectively .
Result	Among children without severe hypotension who were randomised to receive fluid boluses of @ % saline or albumin , mortality was increased ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) compared to controls ( @ % ) , regardless of admission Hb level .
Result	Repeat transfusion varied from @ % in Kenya/Tanzania to @ to @ % at the four Ugandan centres .
Result	Adverse reactions to blood were rare ( @ % ) .
Conclusion	Severe anaemia complicates one third of childhood admissions with serious febrile illness to hospitals in East Africa , and is associated with increased mortality .
Conclusion	A high proportion of deaths occurred within @ hours of admission , emphasizing the need for rapid recognition and prompt blood transfusion .
Conclusion	Adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines was poor .
Conclusion	The high rates of re-transfusion suggest that @ mL/kg whole blood or @ mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children .
Conclusion	Future evaluation of the impact of a larger volume of transfused blood and optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of < @ g/dL is warranted .

Problem	This study aims to evaluate the immediate effect of a global pelvic manipulation ( GPM ) technique , bilaterally applied , on low back pelvic pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea ( PD ) .
Method	A prospective , randomized , double-blind , controlled trial .
Method	Faculty of Nursing , Physiotherapy and Podiatry .
Method	University of Sevilla , Spain .
Method	The sample group included @ women ( @ @ years ) that were divided into an experimental group ( EG ) ( N = @ ) who underwent a bilateral GPM technique and a control group ( CG ) ( N = @ ) who underwent a sham ( placebo ) intervention .
Method	Evaluations were made of self-reported low back pelvic pain ( visual analog scale ) , pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) in sacroiliac joints ( SIJs ) , and the endogenous response of the organism to pain following catecholamines and serotonin release in blood levels .
Result	The intragroup comparison showed a significant improvement in the EG in the self-perceived low back pelvic pain ( P = @ ) and in the mechanosensitivity in both SIJs ( P = @ ) .
Result	In the between-group comparison , there was a decrease in pain perception ( P = @ ; F ( @,@ ) = @ ; R ( @ ) = @ ) and an increase in the PPT of both SIJs , in the right side ( P = @ ; F ( @,@ ) = @ ; R ( @ ) = @ ) and in the left side ( P = @ ; F ( @,@ ) = @ ; R ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	There were no intergroup differences for catecholamines plasma levels ( adrenaline P = @ ; noradrenaline P = @ ; dopamine P = @ ) , but there were for serotonin levels ( P = @ ; F ( @,@ ) = @ ; R ( @ ) = @ ) .
Conclusion	The bilateral GPM technique improves in a short term the self-perceived low back pelvic pain , the PPT in both SIJs , and the serotonin levels in women with PD .
Conclusion	It shows no significant differences with a sham intervention in catecholamines plasma levels .

Problem	Music therapy is an innovative approach to support people with severe mental illness ( SMI ) .
Problem	The aim of the study was to determine whether group music therapy ( GMT ) positively impacted on quality of life ( QoL ) , social enrichment , self-esteem , spirituality and psychiatric symptoms of participants with SMI and how they experienced the intervention .
Method	The primary outcome was QoL ; secondary measures assessed social enrichment , self-esteem , spirituality and psychiatric symptoms .
Method	The @-week intervention comprised singing familiar songs and composing original songs recorded in a professional studio .
Method	Qualitative data were generated from focus group interviews and song lyric analysis .
Result	Ninety-nine adults ( @ female ) were recruited , with an initial cohort ( n = @ ) randomized to either : weekly GMT followed by standard care ( SC ) or SC followed by GMT .
Result	Crossover occurred after @ weeks .
Result	Measures were conducted at baseline , @ , @ and @ weeks .
Result	A second cohort ( n = @ ) could not be randomized and were assigned to GMT followed by SC .
Result	Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between GMT and SC on QoL and spirituality .
Result	This was robust to different assumptions about missing data ( listwise deletion , last observation carried forward or multiple imputation ) .
Result	Per-protocol analysis suggested greater benefit for those receiving more sessions .
Result	Focus group interview and song lyric analyses suggested that GMT was enjoyable ; self-esteem was enhanced ; participants appreciated therapists and peers ; and although challenges were experienced , the programme was recommended to others .
Conclusion	Group music therapy may enhance QoL and spirituality of persons with SMI .

Problem	To investigate the effect of a computer-supported indirect-form lifestyle-modification program using Lifestyle Intervention Support Software for Diabetes Prevention ( LISS-DP ) , as a clinically feasible strategy for primary prevention , on diet and physical activity habits in adults with a family history of type @ diabetes .
Method	This was a two-arm , randomized controlled trial : ( @ ) lifestyle intervention ( LI ) group ( n = @ ) ; ( @ ) control ( n = @ ) .
Method	Healthy adults aged @-@ years with a history of type @ diabetes among their first-degree relatives were recruited .
Method	LI group received three times of lifestyle intervention using LISS-DP during six-month intervention period via mail .
Result	Lifestyle intervention group showed significantly greater decrease in energy intake six months after baseline , compared to control ( -@ and -@ kcal/day , respectively , p = @ , Cohen 's d = @ ) , though the difference disappeared @ year after from baseline .
Result	No difference was found in physical activity energy expenditure .
Conclusion	A computer-based , non-face-to-face lifestyle intervention was effective on dietary habits , only during the intervention period .
Conclusion	Further examination of the long-term effects of such intervention and physical activity is required .

Background	Antithrombin ( AT ) concentrations are reduced after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass compared with the preoperative levels .
Background	Low postoperative AT is associated with worse short - and mid-term clinical outcomes .
Background	The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of AT administration on activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems , platelet function , and the inflammatory response in patients with low postoperative AT levels .
Method	Sixty patients with postoperative AT levels of less than @ % were randomly assigned to receive purified AT ( @ IU in three administrations ) or placebo in the postoperative intensive care unit .
Method	Thirty patients with postoperative AT levels greater than @ % were observed as controls .
Method	Interleukin @ ( a marker of inflammation ) , prothrombin fragment @-@ ( a marker of thrombin generation ) , plasmin-antiplasmin complex ( a marker of fibrinolysis ) , and platelet factor @ ( a marker of platelet activation ) were measured at six different times .
Result	Compared with the no AT group and control patients , patients receiving AT showed significantly higher AT values until @ hours after the last administration .
Result	Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed a significant effect of study treatment in reducing prothrombin fragment @-@ ( p = @ ; interaction with time sample , p = @ ) and plasmin-antiplasmin complex ( p < @ ; interaction with time sample , p < @ ) values but not interleukin @ ( p = @ ; interaction with time sample , p = @ ) and platelet factor @ ( p = @ ; interaction with time sample , p = @ ) .
Result	No difference in chest tube drainage , reopening for bleeding , and blood transfusion was observed .
Conclusion	Antithrombin administration in patients with low AT activity after surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces postoperative thrombin generation and fibrinolysis with no effects on platelet activation and inflammatory response .

Background	Statins have a beneficial effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) and lean mass in some studies of HIV-uninfected adults ; however , this has never been investigated in the setting of HIV infection .
Method	HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral therapy with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of @ mg/dl or less and evidence of heightened immune activation or inflammation were randomized to rosuvastatin @ mg daily or placebo for @ weeks .
Method	This was a prespecified interim analysis at @ weeks .
Method	Between-group and within-group differences were compared ; multivariable regression models were constructed .
Result	Seventy-two individuals were randomized to statin therapy and @ to placebo .
Result	Modest @-week relative increases in trochanter BMD -LSB- @ % ; @ % confidence interval ( @ % CI ) -@ to @ -RSB- and total hip BMD ( @ % ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the statin arm were significantly greater than placebo ( P < @ ) .
Result	The relationship between statin use and total hip BMD change was robust to adjustment of age , sex , race and smoking status ( P = @ ) and strengthened by inclusion of baseline ( P = @ ) and week @ change in soluble tumour necrosis factor - receptor ( sTNFR ) -@ ( P = @ ) .
Result	Relative increases in total body , trunk and limb fat were similar between statin and placebo arms ( P@ @ ) .
Result	Although a significant gain in leg lean mass was seen in the statin arm , this was not significantly different compared with placebo ( P = @ ) .

Background	To determine the effects of participation in Curtin University 's Activity , Food and Attitudes Program ( CAFAP ) , a community-based , family-centered behavioural intervention , on the physical activity , sedentary time , and healthy eating behaviours of overweight and obese adolescents .
Method	In this waitlist controlled clinical trial in Western Australia , adolescents ( n = @ , @ % female , mean age @ ( SD @ ) years ) and parents completed an @-week intervention followed by @ months of telephone and text message support .
Method	Assessments were completed at baseline , before beginning the intervention , immediately following the intervention , and at @ - , @ - , and @ - months follow-up .
Method	The primary outcomes were physical activity and sedentary time assessed by accelerometers and servings of fruit , vegetables and junk food assessed by @-day food records .
Result	During the intensive @-week intervention sedentary time decreased by -@ min/day/month ( @ % CI : -@ , @ ) which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period ( p = @ ) .
Result	Moderate physical activity increased by @ min/day/month ( @ % CI : -@ , @ ) during the intervention period , which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period ( p = @ ) .
Result	Fruit consumption increased during the intervention period ( monthly incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) and junk food consumption decreased ( monthly IRR @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) and these changes were different to those seen during the waitlist period ( p = @ and p = @ respectively ) .
Conclusion	Participating in CAFAP appeared to have a positive influence on the physical activity , sedentary and healthy eating behaviours of overweight and obese adolescents and many of these changes were maintained for one year following the intensive intervention .

Problem	This prospective randomized Phase II study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of an oral nutrition supplement composed of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate , arginine and glutamine ( beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate / arginine/glutamine ) on radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients .
Method	Forty patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer , treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy involving cisplatin were recruited .
Method	They were randomly assigned to the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate / arginine/glutamine supplement treatment group ( Group A ) or the control group that received no supplement ( Group B ) .
Method	The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage of patients developing Grade @ dermatitis .
Method	The secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients developing Grade @ dermatitis , and the duration of each grade of dermatitis relative to the observation period .
Result	The incidence of Grade @ dermatitis did not differ between the two groups .
Result	However , as secondary endpoints of this study , the incidence of Grade @ dermatitis was lower in Group A than B ( @ vs. @ % ; P < @ ) , and the duration of Grade @ dermatitis was shorter in Group A than B ( @ vs. @ % ; P < @ ) , as was the duration of Grade @ dermatitis ( @ vs. @ % ; P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Our study indicated that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate / arginine/glutamine supplementation was potentially effective in the prevention of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients .

Background	Fidelity assessments are integral to intervention research but few published trials report these processes in detail .
Background	We included plans for fidelity monitoring in the design of a community-based intervention trial .
Method	The study design was a randomized clinical trial of an intervention provided to low-income women to increase utilization of dental care during pregnancy ( mother ) or the postpartum ( child ) period .
Method	Group assignment followed a @ @ factorial design in which participants were randomly assigned to receive either brief Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) or Health Education ( HE ) during pregnancy ( prenatal ) and then randomly reassigned to one of these groups for the postpartum intervention .
Method	The study setting was four county health departments in rural Oregon State , USA .
Method	Counseling was standardized using a step-by-step manual .
Method	Counselors were trained to criteria prior to delivering the intervention and fidelity monitoring continued throughout the implementation period based on audio recordings of counselor-participant sessions .
Method	The Yale Adherence and Competence Scale ( YACS ) , modified for this study , was used to code the audio recordings of the counselors ' delivery of both the MI and HE interventions .
Method	Using Interclass Correlation Coefficients totaling the occurrences of specific MI counseling behaviors , ICC for prenatal was @ , for postpartum the ICC was @ .
Method	Participants provided a second source of fidelity data .
Method	As a second source of fidelity data , the participants completed the Feedback Questionnaire that included ratings of their satisfaction with the counselors at the completion of the prenatal and post-partum interventions .
Result	Coding indicated counselor adherence to MI protocol and variation among counselors in the use of MI skills in the MI condition .
Result	Almost no MI behaviors were found in the HE condition .
Result	Differences in the length of time to deliver intervention were found ; as expected , the HE intervention took less time .
Result	There were no differences between the overall participants ' satisfaction ratings of the HE and MI sessions by individual counselor or overall ( p > @ ) .
Conclusion	Trial design , protocol specification , training , and continuous supervision led to a high degree of treatment fidelity for the counseling interventions in this randomized clinical trial and will increase confidence in the interpretation of the trial findings .

Problem	This paper describes the rationale , design , and methods of a two-year randomized controlled trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental intervention in @ elementary schools in Mexico City .
Method	There were two units of analysis , school level addressing changes in elementary public part-time schools , and individual-level addressing behavioral changes in students @ to @ years of age .
Method	Two intensities of an intervention program were implemented ( basic and plus ) , each containing two intervention components : physical activity and nutrition , supported by a communication/education component .
Method	Evaluation of the intervention was carried out during the school cycles @-@ and @-@ .
Result	Primary outcomes were overweight and obesity prevalence and fitness ; environmental and behavioural measures were also examined .
Conclusion	This is the first institutional multilevel , multifactorial project , consistent with the best practices available in current literature , carried out in Mexico to prevent childhood obesity in schools .

Problem	Antisocial personality is a common adult problem that imposes a major public health burden , but for which there is no effective treatment .
Problem	Affected individuals exhibit persistent antisocial behavior and pervasive antisocial character traits , such as irritability , manipulativeness , and lack of remorse .
Problem	Prevention of antisocial personality in childhood has been advocated , but evidence for effective interventions is lacking .
Method	The authors conducted two follow-up studies of randomized trials of group parent training .
Method	One involved @ clinic-referred @ - to @-year-olds with severe antisocial behavior for whom treatment was indicated , @ of whom were reassessed between ages @ and @ .
Method	The other involved @ high-risk @ - to @-year-olds with elevated antisocial behavior who were selectively screened from the community , @ of whom were reassessed between ages @ and @ .
Method	The primary psychiatric outcome measures were the two elements of antisocial personality , namely , antisocial behavior ( assessed by a diagnostic interview ) and antisocial character traits ( assessed by a questionnaire ) .
Method	Also assessed were reading achievement ( an important domain of youth functioning at work ) and parent-adolescent relationship quality .
Result	In the indicated sample , both elements of antisocial personality were improved in the early intervention group at long-term follow-up compared with the control group ( antisocial behavior : odds ratio of oppositional defiant disorder = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ; antisocial character traits : B = -@ , @ % CI = -@ , -@ ) .
Result	Additionally , reading ability improved ( B = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) .
Result	Parental expressed emotion was warmer ( B = @ , @ % CI = @ , @ ) and supervision was closer ( B = -@ , @ % CI = -@ , -@ ) , but direct observation of parenting showed no differences .
Result	Teacher-rated and self-rated antisocial behavior were unchanged .
Result	In contrast , in the selective high-risk sample , early intervention was not associated with improved long-term outcomes .
Conclusion	Early intervention with severely antisocial children for whom treatment is indicated may prevent the development of antisocial personality in adolescence and may improve academic performance .
Conclusion	In contrast , early intervention with selective high-risk samples may be ineffective .

Background	Patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have impaired health-related quality of life .
Background	The thyroid gland has a high selenium concentration , and specific selenoprotein enzyme families are crucial to immune function , and catalyze thyroid hormone metabolism and redox processes in thyroid cells .
Background	Previous randomized controlled trials have found that selenium supplementation decreases thyroid-disease-specific antibody levels .
Background	We hypothesize that selenium might be beneficial in the treatment of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis .
Method	The CATALYST trial is an investigator-initiated randomized , blinded , multicentre clinical trial of selenium supplementation versus placebo in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis .
Method	age @ years ; serum thyroid peroxidase antibody level @ IU/ml within the previous @ months ; treatment with levothyroxine and written informed consent .
Method	previous diagnosis of toxic nodular goitre , Graves ' hyperthyroidism , postpartum thyroiditis , Graves ' orbitopathy ; previous antithyroid drug treatment , radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery ; immune-modulatory or other medication affecting thyroid function ; pregnancy , planned pregnancy or breastfeeding ; allergy towards any intervention or placebo component ; intake of selenium supplementation > @ g/day ; inability to read or understand Danish or lack of informed consent .
Method	The trial will include @ participants .
Method	The experimental intervention and control groups will receive @ g selenium-enriched yeast or matching placebo tablets daily for @ months .

Method	Secondary outcomes include serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentration ; serum triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio ; levothyroxine dosage ; adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions and events .
Conclusion	In this pragmatic trial , participating patients follow their usual treatment at their usual hospitals .
Conclusion	In order to collect high-quality data on the clinical course and quality of life , and to minimize missing data , an elaborate trial management system has been designed .
Conclusion	@ months intervention duration was selected in consideration of the primary outcome , thyroid-related quality of life .

Background	Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition , making it an attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide .
Background	In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition , we tested ketamine 's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition ( Implicit Association Test ; IAT ) previously linked to suicidal behavior .
Method	Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression ( inadequate response to @ antidepressants ) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation ( Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation , Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item , Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item ) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly .
Method	Measures were taken at baseline and @ hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine ( n = @ ) or midazolam ( n = @ ) , a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar , rapid anesthetic effects .
Method	Twenty four hours postinfusion , explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group .
Result	Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at @ hr , compared with @ % of the midazolam group ( ( @ ) = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	Implicit associations between self - and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine ( P = @ ; d = @ ) but not midazolam ( P = @ ; d = @ ) .
Result	Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline , and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms .
Conclusion	Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo .
Conclusion	Further study is warranted to test ketamine 's antisuicidal effects in higher-risk samples .

Background	Noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States .
Background	An understanding of the infectious dose of these viruses is important for risk assessment studies .
Method	Healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled evaluation of different dosages of Norwalk virus .
Method	Eligible subjects were monitored for clinical gastroenteritis , and infection status was determined .
Method	The presence of virus in vomitus was also assessed .
Result	Fifty-seven persons were enrolled ; @ received placebo and an additional @ persons were considered to be nonsusceptible on the basis of being secretor negative .
Result	Twenty-one persons were infected ( all blood group O or A ) , and @ % of those infected developed viral gastroenteritis .
Result	The @ % human infectious dose was calculated to be @ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction units ( approximately @ genomic equivalents -LSB- gEq -RSB- ) for secretor-positive blood group O or A persons and @ ( approximately @ gEq ) for all secretor-positive persons .
Result	The time of illness onset was inversely correlated with inoculum dose .
Result	The maximal concentration of virus shedding was higher for persons with gastroenteritis .
Result	Norwalk virus was identified in @ of @ ( @ % ) vomitus samples at a median concentration of @ @ gEq/mL .
Conclusion	The @ % human infectious dose measured is higher than previous estimates and similar to that of other RNA viruses .
Conclusion	Clinical Trials RegistrationNCT@ .

Background	Heart failure ( HF ) patients suffer from frequent and repeated hospitalizations , causing a substantial economic burden on society .
Background	Hospitalizations can be reduced considerably by better compliance with self-care .
Background	Home telemonitoring has the potential to boost patients ' compliance with self-care , although the results are still contradictory .
Problem	A randomized controlled trial was conducted in order to study whether the multidisciplinary care of heart failure patients promoted with telemonitoring leads to decreased HF-related hospitalization .
Method	HF patients were eligible whose left ventricular ejection fraction was lower than @ % , NYHA functional class @ , and who needed regular follow-up .
Method	Patients in the telemonitoring group ( n = @ ) measured their body weight , blood pressure , and pulse and answered symptom-related questions on a weekly basis , reporting their values to the heart failure nurse using a mobile phone app .
Method	The heart failure nurse followed the status of patients weekly and if necessary contacted the patient .
Method	The primary outcome was the number of HF-related hospital days .
Method	Control patients ( n = @ ) received multidisciplinary treatment according to standard practices .
Method	Patients ' clinical status , use of health care resources , adherence , and user experience from the patients ' and the health care professionals ' perspective were studied .
Result	Adherence , calculated as a proportion of weekly submitted self-measurements , was close to @ % .
Result	No difference was found in the number of HF-related hospital days ( incidence rate ratio -LSB- IRR -RSB- = @ , P = @ ) , which was the primary outcome .
Result	The intervention group used more health care resources : they paid an increased number of visits to the nurse ( IRR = @ , P < @ ) , spent more time at the nurse reception ( mean difference of @ minutes , P < @ ) , and there was a greater number of telephone contacts between the nurse and intervention patients ( IRR = @ , P < @ for nurse-induced contacts and IRR = @ , P = @ for patient-induced contacts ) .
Result	There were no statistically significant differences in patients ' clinical health status or in their self-care behavior .
Result	The technology received excellent feedback from the patient and professional side with a high adherence rate throughout the study .
Conclusion	Home telemonitoring did not reduce the number of patients ' HF-related hospital days and did not improve the patients ' clinical condition .
Conclusion	Patients in the telemonitoring group contacted the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic more frequently , and on this way increased the use of health care resources .

Background	Nitrate , which is an inorganic anion abundant in vegetables , increases the efficiency of isolated human mitochondria .
Background	Such an effect might be reflected in changes in the resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) and formation of reactive oxygen species .
Background	The bioactivation of nitrate involves its active accumulation in saliva followed by a sequential reduction to nitrite , nitric oxide , and other reactive nitrogen species .
Problem	We studied effects of inorganic nitrate , in amounts that represented a diet rich in vegetables , on the RMR in healthy volunteers .
Method	In a randomized , double-blind , crossover study , we measured the RMR by using indirect calorimetry in @ healthy volunteers after a @-d dietary intervention with sodium nitrate ( NaNO ) or a placebo ( NaCl ) .
Method	The nitrate dose ( @ mmol kg d ) corresponded to the amount in @-@ g spinach , beetroot , lettuce , or other vegetable that was rich in nitrate .
Method	Effects of direct nitrite exposure on cell respiration were studied in cultured human primary myotubes .
Result	The RMR was @ % lower after nitrate compared with placebo administration , and the change correlated strongly to the degree of nitrate accumulation in saliva ( r = @ ) .
Result	The thyroid hormone status , insulin sensitivity , glucose uptake , plasma concentration of isoprostanes , and total antioxidant capacity were unaffected by nitrate .
Result	The administration of nitrite to human primary myotubes acutely inhibited respiration .
Conclusion	Dietary inorganic nitrate reduces the RMR .
Conclusion	This effect may have implications for the regulation of metabolic function in health and disease .

Background	Interventions promoting physical activity by General Practitioners ( GPs ) lack a strong evidence base .
Background	Recruiting participants to trials in primary care is challenging .
Background	We investigated the feasibility of ( i ) delivering three interventions to promote physical activity in inactive participants and ( ii ) different methods of participant recruitment and randomised allocation .
Method	We recruited general practices from Devon , Bristol and Coventry .
Method	We used a @-by-@ factorial design for participant recruitment and randomisation .
Method	Recruitment strategies were either opportunistic ( approaching patients attending their GP surgery ) or systematic ( selecting patients from practice lists and approaching them by letter ) .
Method	Randomisation strategies were either individual or by practice cluster .
Method	Feasibility outcomes included time taken to recruit the target number of participants within each practice .
Method	Participants were randomly allocated to one of three interventions : ( i ) written advice ( control ) ; ( ii ) brief GP advice ( written advice plus GP advice on physical activity ) , and ( iii ) brief GP advice plus a pedometer to self-monitor physical activity during the trial .
Method	Participants allocated to written advice or brief advice each received a sealed pedometer to record their physical activity , and were instructed not to unseal the pedometer before the scheduled day of data collection .
Method	Participant level outcomes were reported descriptively and included the mean number of pedometer steps over a @-day period , and European Quality of Life ( EuroQoL ) -@ dimensions ( EQ-@D ) scores , recorded at @weeks ' follow-up .
Result	We recruited @ practices ( @ using each recruitment method ; @ randomising by cluster , @ randomising by individual participant ) , encompassing @ participants .
Result	Opportunistic recruitment was associated with less time to target recruitment compared with systematic ( mean difference ( days ) -@ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ ; -@ ) but with greater loss to follow up ( @ % versus .
Result	@ % ; mean difference @ % ( @ % CI @ % ; @ % ) ) .
Result	There were differences in the socio-demographic characteristics of participants according to recruitment method .
Result	There was no clear pattern of change in participant level outcomes from baseline to @weeks across the three arms .
Conclusion	Delivering and trialling GP-led interventions to promote physical activity is feasible , but trial design influences time to participant recruitment , participant withdrawal , and possibly , the socio-demographic characteristics of participants .

Problem	To evaluate the effectiveness of magnetotherapy in the treatment of hand osteoarthritis ( HO ) .
Method	In this randomized controlled single-blind follow-up study , patients with HO were randomly assigned into @ groups ( G@ and G@ ) .
Method	The subjects in G@ ( n = @ ) received @Hz , @ pulse/s , @-@G , magnetotherapy of totally @ days and @ min/day combined with active range of motion/strengthening exercises for the hand .
Method	G@ ( n = @ ) received sham-magnetotherapy for @ min/day for the same duration combined with the same hand exercises .
Method	Outcome measures were pain and joint stiffness evaluation , handgrip and pinchgrip strength ( HPS ) , Duruz and Auscan Hand Osteoarthritis Indexes ( DAOI ) and Short Form-@ Health Questionnaire ( SF-@ ) administered at baseline , immediately after treatment and at the follow up .
Result	When the groups were compared with each other , improvement observed in SF-@ Pain ( p < @ ) , SF-@ Social Function ( p = @ ) , SF-@ Vitality ( p = @ ) , SF-@ General Health ( p = @ ) , Pain at rest ( p < @ ) , Pain at motion ( p < @ ) , Joint stiffness ( p < @ ) , DAOI ( p < @ ) were in favor of G@ .
Conclusion	Changes in pain , function and quality of life scores showed significant advantage in favor of the applied electromagnetic intervention in patients with HO .

Background	Coronary artery bypass grafting using the radial artery has , since the @s , gone through a revival .
Background	Observational studies have indicated better long-term patency when using radial arteries .
Background	Therefore , radial artery might be preferred especially in younger patients where long time patency is important .
Background	During the last @years different endoscopic techniques to harvest the radial artery have evolved .
Background	Endoscopic radial artery harvest only requires a small incision near the wrist in contrast to open harvest , which requires an incision from the elbow to the wrist .
Background	However , it is unknown whether the endoscopic technique results in fewer complications or a graft patency comparable to open harvest .
Background	When the radial artery has been harvested , there are two ways to use the radial artery as a graft .
Background	One way is sewing it onto the aorta and another is sewing it onto the mammary artery .
Background	It is unknown which technique is the superior revascularisation technique .
Method	The NEO Trial is a randomised clinical trial with a @ factorial design .
Method	We plan to randomise @ participants into four intervention groups : ( @ ) mammario-radial endoscopic group ; ( @ ) aorto-radial endoscopic group ; ( @ ) mammario-radial open surgery group ; and ( @ ) aorto-radial open surgery group.The hand function will be assessed by a questionnaire , a clinical examination , the change in cutaneous sensibility , and the measurement of both sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity at @months postoperatively .
Method	All the postoperative complications will be registered , and we will evaluate muscular function , scar appearance , vascular supply to the hand , and the graft patency including the patency of the central radial artery anastomosis .
Method	A patency evaluation by multi-slice computer tomography will be done at one year postoperatively.We expect the nerve conduction studies and the standardised neurological examinations to be able to discriminate differences in hand function comparing endoscopic to open harvest of the radial artery .
Method	The trial also aims to show if there is any patency difference between mammario-radial compared to aorto-radial revascularisation techniques but this objective is exploratory .

Problem	The goal of this study was to determine whether a less-invasive approach to aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) improves clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with aortic stenosis ( AS ) .
Background	Diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after surgical AVR for AS .
Method	Among treated patients with severe symptomatic AS at high risk for surgery in the PARTNER ( Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve ) trial , we examined outcomes stratified according to diabetes status of patients randomly assigned to receive transcatheter or surgical AVR .
Method	The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at @ year .
Result	Among @ patients enrolled in PARTNER who underwent treatment , there were @ patients with diabetes ( @transcatheter , @ surgical ) .
Result	There was a significant interaction between diabetes and treatment group for @-year all-cause mortality ( p = @ ) .
Result	Among diabetic patients , all-cause mortality at @ year was @ % in the transcatheter group and @ % in the surgical group ( hazard ratio : @ -LSB- @ % confidence interval : @ to @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) .
Result	Results were consistent among patients treated via transfemoral or transapical routes .
Result	In contrast , among nondiabetic patients , there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at @ year ( p = @ ) .
Result	Among diabetic patients , the @-year rates of stroke were similar between treatment groups ( @ % transcatheter vs. @ % surgery ; p = @ ) , but the rate of renal failure requiring dialysis > @ days was lower in the transcatheter group ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Among patients with diabetes and severe symptomatic AS at high risk for surgery , this post-hoc stratified analysis of the PARTNER trial suggests there is a survival benefit , no increase in stroke , and less renal failure from treatment with transcatheter AVR compared with surgical AVR .
Conclusion	( The PARTNER Trial : Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valve Trial ; NCT@ ) .

Background	Knowledge of essential amino acid requirements in infants is important because excessive intake of protein can lead to increased long-term morbidity such as obesity .
Background	A deficient intake may lead to suboptimal growth and impaired neurodevelopment .
Background	The current recommended branched-chain amino acid requirements in infants aged @-@ mo are based on the amino acid content of human milk .
Problem	We quantified the requirements for isoleucine , leucine , and valine for term neonates by using the indicator amino acid oxidation method with -LSB- @ - ( @ ) C -RSB- phenylalanine as the indicator .
Method	Fully enterally fed term infants received randomly graded amounts of isoleucine ( @-@ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ) , leucine ( @-@ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ) , or valine ( @-@ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ) as part of an elemental formula .
Method	Data are expressed as means SDs .
Result	Eighty-three Asian , term neonates ( mean SD birth weight : @ @ kg ; gestational age : @ @ wk ) were studied at a postnatal age of @ @ d. Mean requirements for isoleucine , leucine , and valine ( measured in boys only ) were @ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ( r ( @ ) = @ , P < @ ) , @ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ( r ( @ ) = @ , P < @ ) , and @ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ( r ( @ ) = @ , P = @ ) , respectively .
Conclusion	Current human milk-based recommendations for isoleucine and valine in term infants aged @-@ mo are correct .
Conclusion	However , the current recommendation for leucine ( @ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ) is higher than the mean requirement of @ mg kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) that we determined in this study .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR@ .

Problem	To compare the efficacy and tolerability of monotherapy with phenazepam to complex treatment with the peptide preparation selank and phenazepam in patients with anxiety disorders .
Method	Authors explored the anxiolytic effect and tolerability of monotherapy with phenazepam ( @ patients ) and complex treatment with selank and phenazepam ( @ patients ) in anxiety-phobic , hypochondriac and somatoform disorders ( ICD-@ items F@-@ , F@-@ , F@-@ ) .
Method	Therapeutic effect was assessed clinically and with HDRS , CGI and Spilberger scales .
Method	Tolerability was evaluated using the UKU scale .
Method	Stroop test and verbal fluency test were used .
Method	Quality of life was assessed with the SF-@ .
Result	The positive effect of phenazepam was achieved earlier in the optimization of treatment with selank on HDRS .
Result	The combined treatment decreased the level of undesirable side-effects of phenazepam ( attention and memory impairment , asthenia , sedation , increase in sleep duration , sexual disturbances , emotional indifference and orthostatism ) during the course of treatment and after the tranquilizer withdrawal .
Result	Taken together , the therapeutic efficacy and reduction of side-effects had a positive impact on the quality-of-life of the patients treated with selank as add-on to phenazepam .
Conclusion	The results extend therapeutic possibilities of treatment of anxietyspectrum disorders with the combination of benzodiazepine tranquilizers and selank .

Problem	To assess the efficacy of corneal cross-linking ( CXL ) as an adjuvant to appropriate antifungal therapy in nonresolving deep stromal fungal keratitis .
Method	Randomized clinical trial .
Method	Eyes with culture-positive deep stromal fungal keratitis not responding to appropriate medical therapy for a period of @ weeks were randomized to receive either adjuvant CXL or no additional treatment .
Method	Antifungal medical therapy was continued in both groups .
Method	The prespecified primary outcome was treatment failure at @ weeks after enrollment , defined as perforation and/or increase in ulcer size by @ mm .
Result	The trial was stopped before full enrollment because of a marked difference in the rate of perforation between the @ groups .
Result	Of the @ cases enrolled in the study , @ were randomized to the CXL group and @ to the non-CXL group .
Result	Five eyes in the CXL group and @ eyes in the non-CXL group experienced treatment failure by @ weeks ( P = @ ) .
Result	In a secondary analysis , the CXL group experienced more perforations than the non-CXL group ( @ vs @ , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	CXL used as adjuvant therapy for recalcitrant deep stromal fungal keratitis did not improve outcomes .

Background	Vitamin D and its metabolites have potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro , including up-regulation of cathelicidin , a critical antimicrobial protein .
Problem	We investigated whether administration of @,@-dihydroxyvitamin D ( calcitriol ) to critically ill patients with sepsis would have beneficial effects on markers of innate immunity , inflammation , and kidney injury .
Method	We performed a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , physiologic study among @ critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock .
Method	Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of calcitriol ( @ g intravenously ) versus placebo .
Method	The primary outcome was plasma cathelicidin protein levels assessed @ hours after study drug administration .
Method	Secondary outcomes included leukocyte cathelicidin mRNA expression , plasma cytokine levels ( IL-@ , IL-@ , tumor necrosis factor - , IL-@ , and IL-@ ) , and urinary kidney injury markers .
Result	Patients randomized to calcitriol ( n = @ ) versus placebo ( n = @ ) had similar plasma cathelicidin protein levels at @ hours ( P = @ ) .
Result	Calcitriol-treated patients had higher cathelicidin ( P = @ ) and IL-@ ( P = @ ) mRNA expression than placebo-treated patients @ hours after study drug administration .
Result	Plasma cytokine levels ( IL-@ , IL-@ , tumor necrosis factor - , IL-@ , and IL-@ ) and urinary kidney injury markers were similar in calcitriol - versus placebo-treated patients ( P > @ for all comparisons ) .
Result	Calcitriol had no effect on clinical outcomes nor were any adverse effects observed .
Conclusion	Calcitriol administration did not increase plasma cathelicidin protein levels in critically ill patients with sepsis and had mixed effects on other immunomodulatory markers .
Conclusion	Additional phase II trials investigating the dose and timing of calcitriol as a therapeutic agent in specific sepsis phenotypes may be warranted .
Conclusion	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT @ ) .

Problem	Given the limitations in health care resources , quality-of-life measures for interventions have gained importance .
Problem	To determine whether vision-related quality-of-life outcomes were different between the natamycin and voriconazole treatment arms in the Mycotic Ulcer Treatment Trial I , as measured by an Indian Vision Function Questionnaire .
Method	Secondary analysis ( performed October @-@ , @ ) of a double-masked , multicenter , randomized , active comparator-controlled , clinical trial at multiple locations of the Aravind Eye Care System in South India that enrolled patients with culture - or smear-positive filamentous fungal corneal ulcers who had a baseline visual acuity of @/@ to @/@ ( logMAR of @-@ @ ) .
Method	Study participants were randomly assigned to topical voriconazole , @ % , or topical natamycin , @ % .
Method	Subscale score on the Indian Vision Function Questionnaire from each of the @ subscales ( mobility , activity limitation , psychosocial impact , and visual function ) at @ months .
Result	A total of @ patients were enrolled in the trial , and @ ( @ % ) completed the Indian Vision Function Questionnaire at @ months .
Result	The majority of study participants had subscale scores consistent with excellent function .
Result	After adjusting for baseline visual acuity and organism , we found that study participants in the natamycin-treated group scored , on average , @ points ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) higher than study participants in the voriconazole-treated group ( P = @ ) .
Result	In subgroup analyses looking at ulcers caused by Fusarium species and adjusting for baseline best spectacle-corrected visual acuity , the natamycin-treated group scored @ points ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) higher than the voriconazole-treated group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Differences in quality of life were not detected for patients with Aspergillus or other non-Fusarium species as the causative organism ( @ points -LSB- @ % CI , -@ to @ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	We found evidence of improvement in vision-related quality of life among patients with fungal ulcers who were randomly assigned to natamycin compared with those randomly assigned to voriconazole , and especially among patients with Fusarium species as the causative organism .
Conclusion	Incorporation of quality-of-life measures in clinical trials is important to fully evaluate the effect of the studied interventions .

Problem	To examine whether dexmedetomidine reduces the injection pain of propofol and rocuronium and to investigate whether the decrease in injection pain is associated with the known sedative action of dexmedetomidine .
Method	Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical comparison study .
Method	Patients undergoing general anesthesia with intubation received @ mg of @ % lidocaine ( lidocaine group ; n = @ ) , @ g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( low-dose group ; n = @ ) , @ g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( subclinical dose group ; n = @ ) , @ g/kg of dexmedetomidine ( clinical dose group , n = @ ) , or normal saline ( saline group ; n = @ ) before anesthetic induction .

Method	The BIS value was measured @ seconds after administration of the study drug , and at the time of rocuronium injection and intubation .
Result	The overall incidence of withdrawal movements due to rocuronium decreased significantly as the dose of dexmedetomidine increased ( @ % , @ % , @ % , and @ % in the saline , low-dose , subclinical dose , and clinical dose groups , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Result	There was no significant difference in BIS values among the groups @ seconds after study drug administration or at the time of rocuronium injection .
Conclusion	Dexmedetomidine reduced pain associated with rocuronium injection in a dose-dependent manner .
Conclusion	This effect was not associated with the decrease in BIS value .

Background	Less than half of breast cancer survivors with lymphedema perform self-care as directed .
Background	Effective lymphedema self-care is required to obtain acceptable health outcomes .
Background	Self-Regulation Theory suggests that objective self-measurement of physiological conditions is necessary to promote self-regulation/self-care .
Background	Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) represents a potential self-measurement method for arm lymphedema .
Background	The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of arm self-measurement on daily self-care activities and health outcomes in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema .
Result	A pilot randomized clinical trial compared outcomes between breast cancer survivors with lymphedema who self-monitored for @ months and breast cancer survivors with lymphedema who did not self-monitor .
Result	Data were collected at baseline , months @ , @ , @ , and @ .
Result	Eighty-six women with lymphedema were screened : @ were eligible , @ were enrolled , @ withdrew , and @ had incomplete data , thus N = @ .
Result	No between group differences were noted in participant characteristics .
Result	The self-monitored group had higher days of garment use ( p = @ ) that remained stable after self-monitoring stopped .
Result	The median number of days of simple manual lymphatic drainage increased in the intervention group ( p = @ ) with a downward trend after self-monitoring ceased .
Conclusion	Objective self-monitoring of arms using BIS is possible .
Conclusion	Self-monitoring may positively impact self-care behaviors .
Conclusion	Highly symptomatic patients may require coaching or other psychological support to improve their self-care .
Conclusion	Studies that combine a cognitive behavioral therapy component along with self-measurement should be considered as potential interventions to impact lymphedema self-care .
Conclusion	Other applications of self-monitoring warrant investigation .

Problem	We aimed to evaluate the effects of raw red onion consumption on metabolic features in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome .
Method	In this randomized controlled clinical trial , the patients ( n = @ ) were randomly allocated to the intervention group as ` high-onion ' ( raw red onions : @ @-@ g/day if overweight and @ @-@ g/day if obese ) or to the control group as ` low-onion ' ( raw red onions : @ @-@ g/day ) along with limited liliaceous vegetables for @ weeks .
Method	Body mass index , dietary record , and metabolic parameters ( fasting blood sugar , triglycerides , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and lipoprotein ( a ) ) were evaluated in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline and after @ weeks .
Method	Hormonal variables ( progesterone , prolactin , and @-OH progesterone ) were also measured at baseline .
Result	Onion significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol within each group ; however , these changes were stronger in the high-onion group ( weighted mean differences -LSB- WMD -RSB- : -@ -LSB- @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- : -@ , -@ -RSB- ; P = @ ) than in the low-onion group ( WMD : -@ -LSB- @ % CI : -@ , -@ -RSB- ; P = @ ) .
Result	Similarly , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly ( WMD : -@ -LSB- @ % CI : -@ , -@ ) ; P = @ ) in the high-onion group , and ( WMD : -@ -LSB- @ % CI -@ , -@ -RSB- ; P = @ ) in the low-onion group after treatment .
Result	The levels of fasting blood sugar , triglycerides , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein ( a ) did not differ significantly after @-week onion treatment .
Result	Adjustment for confounders did not make any significant changes in any of the parameters in post-treatment levels .
Conclusion	Raw red onion consumption appears to be effective as a cholesterol-lowering food agent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome .
Conclusion	However , further investigation is warranted .

Problem	To compare the nasal tube with face mask as interfaces for stabilization of very preterm infants at birth by using physiological measurements of leak , obstruction , and expired tidal volumes during positive pressure ventilation ( PPV ) .
Method	In the delivery room , @ infants < @ weeks gestation were allocated to receive respiratory support by nasal tube or face mask .
Method	Respiratory function , heart rate , and oxygen saturation were measured .
Method	Occurrence of obstruction , amount of leak , and tidal volumes were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test or a Fisher exact test .
Result	The first @ minutes after initiation of PPV were analyzed ( @ inflations in the nasal tube group and @ inflations in the face mask group ) .
Result	Spontaneous breathing coincided with PPV in @ % of nasal tube and @ % of face mask inflations .
Result	During inflations , higher leak was observed using nasal tube compared with face mask ( @ % -LSB- @ % -@ % -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @ % -@ % -RSB- ; P < @ ) .
Result	Obstruction occurred more often ( @ % vs @ % ; P < @ ) .
Result	Expired tidal volumes were significantly lower during inflations when using nasal tube compared with face mask ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mL/kg ; P < @ ) and when spontaneous breathing coincided with PPV ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mL/kg ; P < @ ) but were similar during breathing on continuous positive airway pressure ( @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- vs @ -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- mL/kg ; P > @ ) .
Result	Heart rate was not significantly different between groups , but oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the nasal tube group the first @ minutes after start of respiratory support .
Conclusion	The use of a nasal tube led to large leak , more obstruction , and inadequate tidal volumes compared with face mask .

Background	Symptomatic hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) is a disabling condition with up to a @ % cumulative lifetime risk .
Background	Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) is effective in relieving patients ' symptoms and improving function .
Background	It is , however , associated with substantial risk of complications , pain and major functional limitation before patients can return to full function .
Background	In contrast , hip arthroscopy ( HA ) is less invasive and can postpone THA .
Background	However , there is no evidence regarding the delay in the need for THA that patients would find acceptable to undergoing HA .
Background	Knowing patients ' values and preferences ( VP ) on this expected delay is critical when making recommendations regarding the advisability of HA .
Background	Furthermore , little is known on the optimal amount of information regarding interventions and outcomes needed to present in order to optimally elicit patients ' VP .
Method	We will perform a multinational , structured interview-based survey of preference in delay time for THA among patients with non-advanced OA who failed to respond to conservative therapy .
Method	We will combine these interviews with a randomised trial addressing the optimal amount of information regarding the interventions and outcomes required to elicit preferences .
Method	Eligible patients will be randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to either a short or a long format of health scenarios of THA and HA .
Method	We will determine each patient 's VP using a trade-off and anticipated regret exercises .
Method	Our primary outcomes for the combined surveys will be : ( @ ) the minimal delay time in the need for THA surgery that patients would find acceptable to undertaking HA , ( @ ) patients ' satisfaction with the amount of information provided in the health scenarios used to elicit their VPs .

Background	The Swiss health ministry launched a national quality program ` QualiCCare ' in @ to improve health care for patients with COPD.The aim of this study is to determine whether participation in the COPD quality initiative ( ` QualiCCare ' ) improves adherence to recommended clinical processes and shows impact on patients ' COPD care and on the impact of COPD on a person 's life .
Method	CAROL is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with randomization on the general practioner ( GP ) level .
Method	Thirty GPs will be randomly assigned to equally sized intervention group or control group.Each GP will approach consecutively and regardless of the reason for the current consultation , patients aged @ years or older , with a smoking history of ten pack-years ( PY ) .
Method	Patients with confirmed ( by spirometric evaluation ) COPD will be included in the study .
Method	GPs in the intervention group will receive ` QualiCCare ' education , which addresses knowledge , decision-making and behavioural aspects as well as delivery of care according to COPD quality indicators and evidence-based key elements .
Method	In the control group , no educational intervention will be applied and COPD patients will be treated as usual .
Method	The study period is one year.The primary outcome measure is an aggregated score of relevant clinical processes defining elements in the care of patients with COPD : smoking cessation counseling , influenza vaccination , motivation for physical activity , appropriate pharmacotherapy , patient education and collaborative care .
Method	Given a power of @ % and a significance level alpha of @ % , @ GPs recruiting eight patients each will be necessary in both study arms .
Method	With an assumed dropout rate of @ % , @ patients will need to be included .
Conclusion	It is important to develop and implement interventions that add value to COPD care considering quality and efficiency .
Conclusion	Care pathways modifying the knowledge and behavior of physicians have the potential for improving care by transferring knowledge to clinical practice .

Problem	Ramosetron , a serotonin ( @-hydroxytryptamine ) -@ receptor antagonist with high selectivity , reduced stress-induced diarrhea and defecation caused by corticotropin-releasing hormone in rats .
Problem	However , there have been no clinical trials of its effect in patients with diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) .
Problem	We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ramosetron reduces diarrhea in these patients .
Method	Our study included @ male outpatients with IBS-D treated at @ centers in Japan .
Method	Patients were given @ g oral ramosetron ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) once daily for @ weeks after a @-week baseline period .
Method	The primary end point was increased stool consistency in the first month .
Method	Secondary end points included relief of overall IBS symptoms and increased IBS-related quality of life .
Result	More patients given ramosetron ( @ , @ % ) than those given placebo ( @ , @ % ) reported improved stool consistency in the first month ( P < @ ) .
Result	The relative risk and number needed to treat were @ ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) and @ ( @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) , respectively .
Result	The ramosetron group had significantly higher monthly rates of relief of overall IBS symptoms and IBS-related quality of life than the placebo group .
Conclusion	Ramosetron ( @ g oral , once daily for @ weeks ) improved stool consistency in male patients with IBS-D , compared with placebo .
Conclusion	These study results , along with the pharmacologic profile of ramosetron , indicate that increased stool consistency is the best end point for studies of ramosetron in patients with IBS-D .
Conclusion	Clinicaltrials.gov No , NCT@ .

Problem	In the emergency department ( ED ) , intravenous ( IV ) catheter placement is one of the most frequent interventions and may be a real challenge in some conditions .
Problem	Improvement of the success rate with new technology represents a great opportunity .
Problem	This randomized controlled trial aimed to show the superiority of AccuVein to cannulate veins in adults compared to routine care .
Method	After giving written consent , patients were randomized into two groups : routine IV catheter insertion or insertion guided by the AccuVein , which is a hand-held instrument displaying laser light to optimize visualization of veins .
Method	The primary outcome was the time to successful placement of catheters .
Method	Secondary outcomes included the number of attempts , the rate of failure , technique-related pain , occurrence of movements , and efficiency of IV cannulation as perceived by the operator when using the AccuVein device .
Method	Results are given as mean and bootstrapped @ % confidence interval ( CI ) and percentages .
Method	p-values of < @ were considered significant .
Result	A total of @ six patients were included , with @ randomized to routine cannulation and @ to AccuVein .
Result	Patient characteristics were similar .
Result	Time to successful placement of IV catheter ( routine , @ seconds , @ % CI = @ to @ seconds ; and AccuVein , @ seconds , @ % CI = @ to @ seconds ) was not different between groups ( p = @ ) .
Result	Secondary outcomes ( failure and pain ) did not significantly differ , except for movements , which were more frequent when using the AccuVein device ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
Result	Evaluation of the AccuVein by operators was more often negative than positive .
Conclusion	Use of the AccuVein did not improve IV cannulation in nonselected ED patients .

Problem	We investigated the effects of @-year folic acid and vitamin B@ supplementation on cognitive performance in elderly people with elevated homocysteine ( Hcy ) levels .
Method	This multicenter , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial included @,@ elderly participants ( @ years and older ) with Hcy levels between @ and @ mol/L .
Method	Participants received daily either a tablet with @ g folic acid and @ g vitamin B@ ( B-vitamin group ) or a placebo tablet .
Method	Both tablets contained @ g vitamin D@ .
Method	Data were available for global cognitive functioning assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination ( n = @,@ ) , episodic memory ( n = @,@ ) , attention and working memory ( n = @ ) , information processing speed ( n = @ ) , and executive function ( n = @ ) .
Result	Mean age was @ ( SD @ ) years .
Result	Hcy concentrations decreased @ ( @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ ) mol/L in the B-vitamin group and @ ( -@ to -@ ) mol/L in the placebo group .
Result	Cognitive domain scores did not differ over time between the @ groups , as determined by analysis of covariance .
Result	Mini-Mental State Examination score decreased with @ ( -@ to @ ) in the B-vitamin group and @ ( -@ to -@ ) in the placebo group ( p = @ ) , as determined by an independent t test .
Conclusion	Two-year folic acid and vitamin B@ supplementation did not beneficially affect performance on @ cognitive domains in elderly people with elevated Hcy levels .
Conclusion	It may slightly slow the rate of decline of global cognition , but the reported small difference may be attributable to chance .
Method	This study provides Class I evidence that @-year supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B@ in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly people does not affect cognitive performance .

Problem	To compare epithelial connective tissue graft vs porcine collagen matrix for sealing postextraction sockets grafted with deproteinised bovine bone .
Method	A total of @ patients , who needed a maxillary tooth to be extracted between their premolars and required a delayed , fixed , single implant-supported restoration , had their teeth atraumatically extracted and their sockets grafted with deproteinised bovine bone .
Method	Patients were randomised according to a parallel group design into two arms : socket sealing with epithelial connective tissue graft ( group A ) vs porcine collagen matrix ( group B ) .
Method	Outcome measures were : implant success and survival rate , complications , horizontal and vertical alveolar bone dimensional changes measured on Cone Beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scans at three levels localised @ , @ , and @ mm below the most coronal aspect of the bone crest ( levels A , B , and C ) ; and between the palatal and buccal wall peaks ( level D ) ; and peri-implant marginal bone level changes measured on periapical radiographs .
Result	@ patients were randomised to group A and @ to group B. No patients dropped out .
Result	No failed implants or complications were reported @ year after implant placement .
Result	Five months after tooth extraction there were no statistically significant differences between the @ groups for both horizontal and vertical alveolar bone dimensional changes .
Result	At level A the difference was @ @ ; @ % CI @ to @ mm ( P = @ ) , at level B it was @ @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ ( P = @ ) , at level C it was @ @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ mm ( P = @ ) and at level D it was @ @ ; @ % CI -@ to @ mm ( P = @ ) .
Result	One year after implant placement there were no statistically significant differences between the @ groups for peri-implant marginal bone level changes ( difference : @ @ mm ; @ % CI -@ to @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	When teeth extractions were performed atraumatically and sockets were filled with deproteinised bovine bone , sealing the socket with a porcine collagen matrix or a epithelial connective tissue graft showed similar outcomes .
Conclusion	The use of porcine collagen matrix allowed simplification of treatment because no palatal donor site was involved .

Problem	The aim of this study was to investigate whether remedial hydration ( RH ) reduces the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) and short-term adverse events in ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
Method	A total of @ consecutive STEMI patients were prospectively and randomly assigned into two groups : @ patients in the RH group and @ patients in the no RH ( control ) group .
Method	The serum creatinine ( SCr ) and creatinine clearance ( CCr ) levels were measured on admission and at @ , @ and @ hours after primary PCI .
Method	The rates of CIN and short-term adverse events were analyzed for each group .
Method	After surgery , the patients were categorized into four groups according to the Mehran risk score : low ( @ , n = @ ) , moderate ( @-@ , n = @ ) , high ( @-@ , n = @ ) or very high ( @ , n = @ ) .
Result	The incidence of CIN in the RH group was lower than that observed in the control group ( @/@ ; @ % vs. @/@ ; @ % , p < @ ) .
Result	The subgroup analysis showed that the rate of CIN was lower in the moderate ( @/@ ; @ % vs. @/@ ; @ % , p < @ ) and significantly lower in both the high ( @/@ ; @ % vs. @/@ ; @ % , p < @ ) and very high score groups ( @/@ ; @ % vs. @/@ ; @ % , p < @ ) among the RH patients compared to the controls .
Result	At @ , @ and @ hours after PCI , the patients in the RH group exhibited lower SCr levels and higher CCr levels than the patients in the control group ( both p < @ ) .
Result	A lower incidence of in-hospital clinical events was also observed in the RH group .
Conclusion	Remedial hydration decreases the occurrence of CIN and improves the short-term prognosis of STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI .

Problem	To investigate the effect of nicotine on choroidal thickness using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
Method	Prospective , case-control study .
Method	Sixteen young , healthy subjects and @ age and gender matched control cases were included in this study ; @ mg nicotine gum was given to the study group and placebo gum to the control group .
Method	All participants underwent OCT scanning with a high-speed and resolution spectral-domain OCT device ( @D OCT @ , Topcon , Japan ) at baseline , and @ h following nicotine or placebo administration .
Method	The measurements were taken in the morning ( @:@ -@:@ hours ) to avoid diurnal fluctuation .
Result	The median foveal choroidal thickness at baseline was @ m ( IQR @ ) , which decreased to @ m ( IQR @ ) at @ h following oral nicotine intake ( p = @ ) .
Result	The median choroidal thickness was also significantly decreased at five other extrafoveal points ( p < @ for all ) .
Result	In the control group , the median baseline choroidal thickness at the fovea was @ m ( IQR @ ) , and was @ m ( IQR @ ) at @ h ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Nicotine causes a significant decrease in choroidal thickness following oral intake .
Conclusion	This acute decrease might be a result of reduced ocular blood flow due to the vasoconstrictive effect of nicotine .

Problem	To assess whether an oxygen saturation ( Spo@ ) target of @ % -@ % compared with @ % -@ % reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of death or major disability at @ years of age in infants born at < @ weeks ' gestation .
Method	A total @ infants were randomized to a lower or higher target from < @ hours of age until @ weeks ' gestational age .
Method	Blinding was achieved by targeting a displayed Spo@ of @ % -@ % using a saturation monitor offset by @ % within the range @ % -@ % .
Method	True saturations were displayed outside this range .
Method	Follow-up at @ years ' corrected age was by pediatric examination and formal neurodevelopmental assessment .
Method	Major disability was gross motor disability , cognitive or language delay , severe hearing loss , or blindness .
Result	The primary outcome was known for @ infants with @ using surrogate language information .
Result	Targeting a lower compared with a higher Spo@ target range had no significant effect on the rate of death or major disability at @ years ' corrected age ( @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- vs @/@ -LSB- @ % -RSB- ; relative risk @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) or any secondary outcomes .
Result	Death occurred in @ ( @ % ) and @ ( @ % ) of those randomized to the lower and higher target , respectively , and blindness in @ % and @ % .
Conclusion	Although there was no benefit or harm from targeting a lower compared with a higher saturation in this trial , further information will become available from the prospectively planned meta-analysis of this and @ other trials comprising a total of nearly @ infants .

Problem	Mindfulness-based interventions may be acceptable to veterans who have poor adherence to existing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Problem	To compare mindfulness-based stress reduction with present-centered group therapy for treatment of PTSD .
Method	Randomized clinical trial of @ veterans with PTSD recruited at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center from March @ to December @ .
Method	Outcomes were assessed before , during , and after treatment and at @-month follow-up .
Method	Data collection was completed on April @ , @ .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to receive mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy ( n = @ ) , consisting of @ sessions ( @ weekly @-hour group sessions and a daylong retreat ) focused on teaching patients to attend to the present moment in a nonjudgmental , accepting manner ; or present-centered group therapy ( n = @ ) , an active-control condition consisting of @ weekly @-hour group sessions focused on current life problems .
Method	The primary outcome , change in PTSD symptom severity over time , was assessed using the PTSD Checklist ( range , @-@ ; higher scores indicate greater severity ; reduction of @ or more considered a minimal clinically important difference ) at baseline and weeks @ , @ , @ , and @ .
Method	Secondary outcomes included PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity assessed by independent evaluators using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale along with improvements in depressive symptoms , quality of life , and mindfulness .
Result	Participants in the mindfulness-based stress reduction group demonstrated greater improvement in self-reported PTSD symptom severity during treatment ( change in mean PTSD Checklist scores from @ to @ vs @ to @ with present-centered group therapy ; between-group difference , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) and at @-month follow-up ( change in mean scores from @ to @ vs @ to @ , respectively ; difference , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ , P < @ ) .
Result	Although participants in the mindfulness-based stress reduction group were more likely to show clinically significant improvement in self-reported PTSD symptom severity ( @ % vs @ % with present-centered group therapy ; difference , @ % ; @ % CI , @ % -@ % ; P = @ ) at @-month follow-up , they were no more likely to have loss of PTSD diagnosis ( @ % vs @ % , respectively ; difference , @ % ; @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Among veterans with PTSD , mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy , compared with present-centered group therapy , resulted in a greater decrease in PTSD symptom severity .
Conclusion	However , the magnitude of the average improvement suggests a modest effect .

Background	We investigated cardiac proinflammatory , mitogenic , and apoptotic signaling events , and plasma biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in de novo adult cardiac transplant ( CTX ) patients receiving tacrolimus ( TAC ) or cyclosporine A ( CsA ) .
Method	One hundred CTX recipients were randomized @:@ to TAC/CsA in a prospective , randomized open-label multicenter study .
Method	Biomarkers of inflammation , immunity , oxidative stress , and cardiac signaling underlying growth and inflammation ( extracellular signal-related kinase @/@ , p@ mitogen-activated protein kinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases -LSB- MEK -RSB- @/@ and @/@ , c-Src ) , and apoptosis and survival ( c-Jun NH@-terminal kinases -LSB- JNK -RSB- , Bax/Bcl@ , Akt ) were assessed at @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ weeks post-CTX .
Method	Plasma from healthy controls ( n = @ ) and tissue from explanted non-failing hearts ( n = @ ) were used as controls .
Result	Biomarkers of inflammation/immunity ( interleukin -@ and -@ , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule , E-selectin , monocyte chemoattractant protein-@ , osteopontin , fibrinogen , N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide , high-sensitive C-reactive protein ) and oxidative stress ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , nitrotyrosine ) were increased , and antioxidant capacity was ( glutathione/glutathione disulfide ) decreased in patients vs healthy controls ( p < @ ) .
Result	Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt was increased , and Bax/Bcl was decreased in transplanted vs non-transplanted hearts .
Result	Except for plasma fibrinogen , which was lower in TAC vs. CsA , ( p = @ ) , there were no significant differences in parameters studied between TAC vs CsA immunoprophylaxis .
Conclusion	De novo CTX recipients exhibit significant sub-clinical inflammation and oxidative stress that persists @ months after transplantation .
Conclusion	Associated with this is activation of myocardial growth and inflammatory signaling and decreased apoptosis .
Conclusion	Our findings suggest that CTX is an inflammatory condition associated with oxidative stress and myocardial growth regardless of CsA or TAC immunoprophylaxis and independently of rejection status .

Problem	Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospital admission have important clinical and societal implications .
Problem	We sought to investigate the incidence , recurrence , risk factors , and mortality of patients with COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission compared with those without hospital admission during @-year follow-up .
Problem	Patients with COPD ( N = @,@ ) were identified from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints ( ECLIPSE ) observational cohort .
Method	An analysis of time to first event of hospital admission was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression adjusting for possible confounders .
Result	Of the @,@ patients , @ ( @ % ) reported a total of @,@ COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission during the study period ; @ patients ( @ % ) reported multiple events .
Result	A prior history of exacerbation of COPD requiring hospital admission was the factor associated with the highest risk of a new hospitalization for exacerbation ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	Other risk factors included more severe airflow limitation , poorer health status , older age , radiologic evidence of emphysema , and higher WBC count .
Result	Having been hospitalized for exacerbation significantly increased the risk of mortality ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospital admission occur across all stages of airflow limitation and are a significant prognostic factor of reduced survival across all COPD stages .
Conclusion	Patients with COPD at a high risk for hospitalization can be identified by their past history for similar events , and other factors , including the severity of airflow limitation , poor health status , age , presence of emphysema , and leukocytosis .

Problem	To test the hypothesis that a brief , clinic-based , single-session programme will reduce the rate of @ selected condom use errors in a clinical sample of young black men ( YBM ) ages @ through @ years .
Method	Data were collected in clinics treating patients with sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) in three southern US cities .
Method	Males @-@years of age who identified as black/African-American , and reported recent ( past @months ) condom use were eligible .
Method	Only those also reporting condom use in the @months prior to a @-month follow-up assessment ( n = @ ) were included in this secondary analysis of data from a randomised , controlled trial .
Method	Difference scores were used to capture a GroupTime effect .
Result	YBM reported @ condom use events in the @months preceding study enrolment and @ in the @months preceding the follow-up assessment .
Result	Mean baseline error rates were @ and @ for young men randomised to the intervention and control conditions , respectively .
Result	Follow-up rates were @ and @ for young men randomised to the intervention and control conditions , respectively .
Result	Controlled findings yielded a significant effect for the influence of group assignment on the difference score ( baseline to follow-up ) in the condom use error rate ( = @ ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	A brief , clinic-based counselling programme produced modest reductions in condom use errors among YBM attending STI clinics in the southern USA Intensified clinic-based intervention that helps YBM improve the quality of their condom use behaviours is warranted .

Problem	The aims of this study were to compare strut tissue coverage at six-month follow-up after Nobori biolimus-eluting stent ( N-BES ) versus sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) implantation .
Result	A total of @ patients with a single stenotic lesion requiring revascularisation were randomly assigned to either N-BES ( n = @ ) or SES ( n = @ ) .
Result	Baseline optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) was performed post stent implantation , and follow-up OCT was scheduled at six months .
Result	Post-intervention and follow-up OCT analyses were available in @ ( @ % ) and @ ( @ % ) patients , respectively .
Result	The primary endpoint was the percentage of uncovered struts at follow-up OCT in all cross-sections with analysis of @ mm longitudinal intervals .
Result	In addition , an OCT contour plot analysis was constructed to investigate the distribution patterns of uncovered struts .
Result	The percentage of uncovered struts of N-BES was significantly lower versus SES ( @ % versus @ % , respectively , p = @ ) .
Result	N-BES showed a greater NIH thickness than SES ( median -LSB- interquartile range -RSB- @ m -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- versus @ m -LSB- @-@ @ -RSB- , p = @ ) .
Result	Contour plot analyses showed a lower incidence of a diffuse distribution pattern of uncovered struts ( @ % versus @ % , respectively , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This randomised OCT study showed that N-BES had a significantly lower percentage of uncovered struts , and less common diffuse distribution pattern of uncovered struts versus SES .

Problem	Evaluate the effect of high-oleic and conventional peanuts within a hypocaloric-diet on energy metabolism and body composition .
Method	This @-week randomized clinical trial included males with BMI of @ kg m ( -@ ) and aged between @ and @ years .
Method	Participants were assigned to the groups : control ( CT , n = @ ) that followed a hypocaloric-diet ; conventional peanuts ( CVP , n = @ ) or high-oleic peanuts ( HOP , n = @ ) that received the hypocaloric-diet including ( not adding ) @ g day ( -@ ) of peanuts .
Method	Glucose , fat oxidation , and body fatness and lean mass were the main outcomes .
Result	Body weight and composition did not differ between groups .
Result	However , within group total body fat ( kg ) reduced with CVP and HOP , with a significant decrease in body fat percentage in HOP .
Result	While total lean mass ( kg ) decreased in CT , total lean mass ( % ) increased in HOP .
Result	Truncal lean mass decreased in the CT. .
Result	At baseline , HOP had greater postprandial fat oxidation than the CVP .
Result	After @-weeks , fasting fat oxidation increased in CVP and HOP .
Result	Fat oxidation increased in CT and HOP during the @ min after meal intake compared to the fasting condition .
Conclusion	Regular peanut consumption , especially the high-oleic type , within a hypocaloric-diet increased fat oxidation and reduced body fatness in overweigh and obese men .

Background	There is a higher prevalence of obesity in individuals with mental disorders compared to the general population .
Background	The results of several studies suggested that weight reduction in this population is possible following psycho-educational and/or behavioural weight management interventions .
Background	Evidence of the effectiveness alone is however inadequate for policy making .
Background	The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a health promotion intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders .
Method	A Markov decision-analytic model using a public payer perspective was applied , projecting the one-year results of a @-week intervention over a time horizon of @ years , assuming a repeated yearly implementation of the programme .
Method	Scenario analysis was applied evaluating the effects on the results of alternative modelling assumptions .
Method	One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects on the results of varying key input parameters .
Result	An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of @,@ / quality-adjusted life years ( QALY ) in men , and @,@ / QALY in women was found in the base case .
Result	Scenario analysis assuming an increase in health-related quality of life as a result of the body mass index decrease resulted in much better cost-effectiveness in both men ( @,@ / QALY ) and women ( @,@ / QALY ) .
Result	The uncertainty associated with the intervention effect had the greatest impact on the model .
Conclusion	As far as is known to the authors , this is the first health economic evaluation of a health promotion intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders .
Conclusion	Such research is important as it provides payers and governments with better insights how to spend the available resources in the most efficient way .
Conclusion	Further research examining the cost-effectiveness of health promotion targeting physical activity and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders is required .

Problem	This study examines effects of a school garden intervention on elementary school children 's physical activity ( PA ) .
Method	Twelve schools in New York were randomly assigned to receive the school garden intervention ( n = @ ) or to the waitlist control group that later received gardens ( n = @ ) .
Method	PA was measured by self-report survey ( Girls Health Enrichment Multi-site Study Activity Questionnaire ) ( N = @ ) and accelerometry ( N = @ , @ schools ) at baseline ( Fall @ ) and follow-up ( Spring @ , Fall @ , Spring @ ) .
Method	Direct observation ( N = @ , @ schools ) was employed to compare indoor ( classroom ) and outdoor ( garden ) PA. .
Method	Analysis was by general linear mixed models .
Result	Survey data indicate garden intervention children 's reports of usual sedentary activity decreased from pre-garden baseline to post-garden more than the control group children 's ( = -@ , p = @ ) .
Result	Accelerometry data reveal that during the school day , children in the garden intervention showed a greater increase in percent of time spent in moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA from baseline to follow-up than the control group children ( = +@ , p = @ ; = +@ , p = @ ) .
Result	Direct observation within-group comparison of children at schools with gardens revealed that children move more and sit less during an outdoor garden-based lesson than during an indoor , classroom-based lesson .
Conclusion	School gardens show some promise to promote children 's PA. .

Background	Second-generation everolimus-eluting stents ( EES ) and third generation biolimus-eluting stents ( BES ) have been shown to be superior to first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents ( PES ) and second-generation sirolimus-eluting stents ( SES ) .
Background	However , neointimal proliferation and very late stent thrombosis is still an unresolved issue of drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation overall .
Background	The Absorb ( Abbott Vascular , Abbott Park , IL , USA ) is the first CE approved DES with a bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ) thought to reduce long-term complication rates .

Method	The EVERBIO II trial is a single-center , assessor-blinded , randomized trial .
Method	The study population consists of all patients aged@ years old undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention .
Method	Exclusion criterion is where the lesion can not be treated with BVS ( reference vessel diameter > @ mm ) .
Method	A total of @ patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned into @ groups of @ with either BVS , EES or BES implantation .
Method	All patients will undergo a follow-up angiography study at @ months .
Method	Clinical follow-up for up to @ years will be conducted by telephone .
Method	The primary endpoint is in-segment late lumen loss at @ months measured by quantitative coronary angiography .
Method	Secondary endpoints are patient-oriented major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) ( death , myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization ) , device-oriented MACE ( cardiac death , myocardial infarction and target-lesion revascularization ) , stent thrombosis according to ARC and binary restenosis at follow-up @ months angiography .
Conclusion	EVERBIO II is an independent , randomized study , aiming to compare the clinical efficacy , angiographic outcomes and safety of BVS , EES and BES in all comer patients .

Background	Physical therapy is recommended for the management of axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA ) and flexibility exercises have traditionally been the main focus .
Background	Cardiovascular ( CV ) diseases are considered as a major health concern in axSpA and there is strong evidence that endurance and strength exercise protects against CV diseases .
Background	Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of high intensity endurance and strength exercise on disease activity and CV health in patients with active axSpA .
Method	In a single blinded randomized controlled pilot study the exercise group ( EG ) performed @ weeks of endurance and strength exercise while the control group ( CG ) received treatment as usual .
Method	The primary outcome was the Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) .
Method	Secondary outcomes included patient reported disease activity ( Bath AS Disease Activity Index -LSB- BASDAI -RSB- ) , physical function ( Bath AS Functional Index -LSB- BASFI -RSB- ) , and CV risk factors measured by arterial stiffness ( Augmentation Index -LSB- Alx -RSB- ) and Pulse Wave Velocity -LSB- PWV -RSB- ) , cardiorespiratory fitness ( VO@ peak ) and body composition .
Method	ANCOVA on the post intervention values with baseline values as covariates was used to assess group differences , and Mann Whitney U-test was used for outcomes with skewed residuals .
Result	Twenty-eight patients were included and @ ( EG , n = @ , CG , n = @ ) completed the study .
Result	A mean treatment effect of -@ ( @ % CI : -@ , @ ) was seen in ASDAS score .
Result	Treatment effects were also observed in secondary outcomes ( mean group difference -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- ) : BASDAI : -@ ( -@ , -@ ) , BASFI : -@ ( -@ , -@ ) , arterial stiffness ( estimated median group differences -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- ) : AIx ( % ) : -@ ( -@ , -@ ) , and for PVW ( m/s ) : -@ ( -@ , @ ) , VO@ peak ( ml/kg/min ) ( mean group difference -LSB- @ % CI -RSB- : @ ( @ , @ ) and trunk fat ( % ) : -@ ( -@ , -@ ) .
Result	No adverse events occurred .
Conclusion	High intensity exercise improved disease activity and reduced CV risk factors in patients with active axSpA .
Conclusion	These effects will be further explored in a larger trial .

Problem	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two exercise programs on lower extremity function in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis .
Method	Thirty patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis participated in this study .
Method	Pain , passive range of motion , muscle strength , balance , and functional abilities were assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale , goniometer , handheld dynamometer , Flamingo Balance Test , Functional Reach Test , @-meter walking test , @-stair climbing test , and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire .
Method	Participants were randomly assigned to the strengthening exercise group ( group @ , n = @ ) or the proprioceptive-balance exercise group ( group @ , n = @ ) .
Result	Intragroup analysis showed statistically significant improvements in all outcome measures except muscle strength in the hip and ankle after strengthening exercises in group @ .
Result	However , statistically significant improvements were found in all outcome measures after the proprioceptive-balance exercises in group @ .
Result	Intergroup analysis showed statistically significant improvement in all outcome measures in group @ except for the Numeric Rating Scale , Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire , and passive range of motion scores and hip extension and knee flexion muscle strengths .
Conclusion	This study demonstrates that exercise treatment significantly improves musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis .
Conclusion	However , balance-proprioceptive exercises prove to be effective more than strengthening exercises for improving lower extremity function such as walking , climbing stairs , and balance in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis .

Problem	A high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential ( SSVEP ) has been suggested for the reduction of eye fatigue for SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) .
Problem	However , the poor performance of high-frequency SSVEP requires a novel stimulus of better performance even with low eye fatigue .
Problem	As an alternative to the high-frequency SSVEP , we explore the SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated stimulus ( AM-SSVEP ) to verify its availability for brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) .
Method	An amplitude-modulated stimulus was generated as the product of two sine waves at a carrier frequency ( fc ) and a modulating frequency ( fm ) .
Method	The carrier frequency was higher than @ Hz to reduce eye fatigue , and the modulating frequency ranged around the - band ( @-@ Hz ) to utilize low-frequency harmonic information .
Method	Four targets were used in combinations of three different modulating frequencies and two different carrier frequencies in the offline experiment , and two additional targets were added with one additional modulating and one carrier frequency in online experiments .
Result	In the AM-SSVEP spectra , seven harmonic components were identified at @fc , @fm , fcfm , fc@fm , and @fc-@fm .
Result	Using an optimized combination of the harmonic frequencies , online experiments demonstrated that the accuracy of the AM-SSVEP was equivalent to that of the low-frequency SSVEP .
Result	Furthermore , subject evaluation indicated that an AM stimulus caused lower eye fatigue and less sensing of flickering than a low-frequency stimulus , in a manner similar to a high-frequency stimulus .
Conclusion	The actual stimulus frequencies of AM-SSVEPs are in the high-frequency band , resulting in reduced eye fatigue .
Conclusion	Furthermore , AM-SSVEPs can utilize both fundamental stimulus frequencies and non-integer harmonic frequencies including low frequencies for SSVEP recognition .
Conclusion	The feasibility of AM-SSVEP with high BCI performance and low eye fatigue was confirmed through offline and online experiments .
Conclusion	AM-SSVEPs combine the advantages of both low - and high-frequency SSVEPs -- high power and low eye fatigue , respectively .
Conclusion	AM-SSVEP-based BCI systems exploit these advantages , making them promising for application in practical BCI systems .

Problem	In lung cancer screening , the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms is high among heavy smokers .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to compare CT-derived airway wall measurements between male smokers with and those without chronic respiratory symptoms .
Method	Fifty male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms ( cough , excessive mucus secretion , dyspnea , and wheezing ) and @ without any respiratory symptom were randomly selected from the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial .
Method	Thin-slice low-dose CT images were evaluated with dedicated software for airway measurements .
Method	Wall area percentage and airway wall thickness were measured from trachea to bronchi in five different pulmonary lobes of airways with a luminal diameter of @ mm or greater .
Method	Association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was analyzed by multiple linear regression adjusted for age , body mass index , smoking status , emphysema , and pulmonary function .
Result	After adjustment for relevant factors , a significant positive association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was found in airways with a luminal diameter between @ to @ mm ( p < @ ) , but not in airways measuring @ mm or greater ( p > @ ) .
Result	At the airway level between @ to @ mm , the mean wall area percentages were @ % @ % .
Result	Airway wall thicknesses were @ @ mm and @ @ mm ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	Male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms in lung cancer screening , who are at high-risk of chronic bronchitis , have bronchial wall thickening in airways with a luminal diameter of @-@ mm but not in larger airways .

Problem	The aim of the present study was to investigate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of dexketoprofen trometamol ( DT ) and paracetamol on deep acute somatic pain and inflammation in patients undergoing impacted third molar surgery .
Problem	This study was planned to present benefits that we could obtain with low burden of drug .
Method	Effects of drugs , which were administered preemptively before the procedure , on pain , mouth-opening limitation , and swelling were assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and mouth-opening measurement .
Method	Following surgery , time intervals when the patients first need to receive the drug were measured .
Result	The VAS scores of the patients were lower in the side treated with DT than that in the paracetamol treated side .
Result	There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of mouth-opening limitation .
Result	MRI recordings revealed that swelling was lower in the side treated with paracetamol than DT treated side .
Conclusion	Administration of the drugs before surgery contributed to the postoperative patient comfort .
Conclusion	The analgesic activity of @ mg dose of DT was similar to , even better than , the analgesic activity of @ mg dose of paracetamol ; however , DT had insufficient anti-inflammatory efficacy .

Problem	This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation ( TEAS ) to treat muscle spasticity after brain injury ( Chinese Clinical Trial Registry : ChiCTR-TRC-@ ) .
Method	A total of @ patients with muscle spasticity after brain injury were randomized to the following @ groups : @ , @ , and @ Hz ( sham ) TEAS .
Method	The acupoints Hegu ( LI@ ) -- Yuji ( LU@ ) and Zusanli ( ST@ ) -- Chengshan ( BL@ ) on the injured side were stimulated at @ , @ , or @ Hz , @ times per week for @ weeks .
Method	The patients were followed up for @ and @ months after the treatments .
Method	The effects of the treatments on muscle spasticity at the wrist , thumb , the other @ fingers , elbow , shoulder , knee , and ankle were evaluated by the Modified Ashworth Scale , and the effects on disability were assessed by the Disability Assessment Scale .
Method	The walking capability was evaluated by the Holden functional ambulation classification score .
Method	The overall performance was assessed by the Global Assessment Scale score and the improved Barthel Index .
Method	The safety of the treatments administered was also monitored .
Result	The wrist spasticity was significantly reduced from baseline at weeks @ , @ , and @ of treatment and at the @ - and @-month follow-up visits in the @ Hz group ( P < @ ) .
Result	Compared with @ Hz or sham TEAS , @ Hz TEAS decreased wrist spasticity at weeks @ , @ , and @ of treatment and @ month after treatment ( P < @ ) .
Result	The other endpoints were not affected by the treatments .
Result	No treatment-emergent adverse events were reported during treatments and follow-up visits .
Conclusion	TEAS appears to be a safe and effective therapy to relieve muscle spasticity after brain injury , although large-scale studies are required to further verify the findings .

Background	The prevalence of type @ diabetes ( T@D ) in youth is increasing .
Background	Treatment options beyond metformin and insulin are needed .
Background	The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide once daily in youth ( @-@ years old ) with T@D were investigated in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial .
Method	Youth treated with diet/exercise alone or with metformin and having a hemoglobin A@c ( HbA@c ) level of @-@ % were randomized to liraglutide ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
Method	Starting at @ mg/day , doses were escalated weekly to @ , @ , @ , and @ mg/day ( or placebo equivalent ) for @ weeks .
Result	Nineteen participants completed the trial .
Result	Baseline characteristics were similar between groups , with mean ( SD ) values for age of @ ( @ ) years , weight of @ ( @ ) kg ( range , @-@ kg ) , diabetes duration of @ ( @ ) years , and HbA@c level of @ % ( @ % ) .
Result	No serious adverse events ( AEs ) , including severe hypoglycemia , occurred .
Result	Transient gastrointestinal AEs were most common at lower liraglutide doses during dose escalation .
Result	No significant changes in safety and tolerability parameters occurred .
Result	There was no evidence of pancreatitis or lipase elevations above three times the upper normal limit ; calcitonin levels remained within the normal range .
Result	For liraglutide @ mg , mean half-life was @ h , and clearance was @ L/h .
Result	After @ weeks , the decline in HbA@c level was greater with liraglutide versus placebo ( -@ vs. @ % , P = @ ) , whereas mean body weight remained stable ( -@ vs. -@ kg , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	Liraglutide was well tolerated in youth with T@D , with safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetic profiles similar to profiles in adults .

Problem	The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques is driven by the quest for better patient outcomes .
Problem	There is some evidence for the use of minimally invasive surgery for degenerative lumbar spine stenosis ( LSS ) , but there are currently no studies comparing outcomes with matched controls .
Problem	The object of this study was to compare outcomes following minimally invasive unilateral laminectomy for bilateral decompression ( ULBD ) to a standard `` open '' laminectomy for LSS .
Method	The authors conducted a prospective , @:@ randomized trial comparing ULBD to open laminectomy for degenerative LSS .
Method	The study enrolled @ patients between @ and @ , and adequate data for analysis were available in @ patients ( @ in each arm of the study ) .
Method	Patient demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics were recorded and clinical outcomes were obtained using pre - and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) scores , visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores for leg pain , patient satisfaction index scores , and postoperative @-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-@ ) scores .
Result	Significant improvements were observed in ODI and VAS scores for both open and ULBD interventions ( p < @ for both groups using either score ) .
Result	In addition , the ULBD-treated patients had a significantly better mean improvement in the VAS scores ( p = @ ) but not the ODI scores ( p = @ ) compared with patients in the open-surgery group .
Result	ULBD-treated patients had a significantly shorter length of postoperative hospital stay ( @ vs. @ hours , p = @ ) and time to mobilization ( @ vs. @ hours , p < @ ) and were more likely to not use opioids for postoperative pain ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Based on short-term follow-up , microscopic ULBD is as effective as open decompression in improving function ( ODI score ) , with the additional benefits of a significantly greater decrease in pain ( VAS score ) , postoperative recovery time , time to mobilization , and opioid use .

Problem	To compare a motivational intervention ( MI ) focused on increasing involvement in @-Step groups ( TSGs ; e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous ) versus brief advice ( BA ) to attend TSGs .
Method	Patients were assigned randomly to either the MI or BA condition , and followed-up at @ months after discharge .
Method	One hundred and forty substance use disorder ( SUD ) patients undergoing in-patient detoxification ( detox ) in Norway .
Method	The primary outcome was TSG affiliation measured with the Alcoholics Anonymous Affiliation Scale ( AAAS ) , which combines meeting attendance and TSG involvement .
Method	Substance use and problem severity were also measured .
Result	At @ months after treatment , compared with the BA group , the MI group had higher TSG affiliation -LSB- @ point higher AAAS score ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @ to @ ; P = @ -RSB- .
Result	The MI group reported @ fewer days of alcohol use ( @ versus @ days ; @ % CI = -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) and @ fewer days of drug use ( @ versus @ days ; @ % CI = -@ to -@ ; P = @ ) ; however , abstinence rates and severity scores did not differ between conditions .
Result	Analyses controlling for duration of in-patient treatment did not alter the results .
Conclusion	A motivational intervention in an in-patient detox ward was more successful than brief advice in terms of patient engagement in @-Step groups and reduced substance use at @ months after discharge .
Conclusion	There is a potential benefit of adding a maintenance-focused element to standard detox .

Problem	It was the aim of this study to compare the efficacy of ozone therapy and drug treatment in patients with painful temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) disorder ( TMD ) .
Method	A total of @ patients with TMD were enrolled ; @ were treated with bio-oxidative therapy and @ with a ketoprofen tablet thiocolchicoside capsule @ @ for @ days .
Method	Maximum voluntary interincisal mouth opening ( MMO ) was measured in millimeters using a scale and recorded during the pre - and posttreatment periods .
Method	The patients evaluated their subjective pain using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
Method	Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test , the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test , and the independent t test .
Result	The mean MMO of the group that received ozone therapy during the pretreatment period was @ @ mm , and it immediately increased to @ @ mm after @ week of ozone therapy , which was statistically significant ( p = @ ) .
Result	For those who received medication , the mean MMO during the pretreatment period was @ mm , and at the end of @ week it was @ mm .
Result	In the ozone group , @ % of patients showed a gradual decrease in their VAS pain scores compared to pretreatment values ( @ @ to @ @ ) .
Result	In the medication group , @ % of patients showed a significant decrease in VAS pain scores during the follow-up period ( @ @ to @ @ ) .
Conclusion	This study showed that bio-oxidative therapy was a more effective treatment than medication therapy for relieving TMJ pain .

Background	Parathyroidectomy in patients with hyperparathyroidism can produce subsequent increases in bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
Background	Ronacaleret , a selective calcium-sensing receptor antagonist that stimulates endogenous parathyroid hormone release , induced mild hyperparathyroidism .
Problem	The aim of this study is to evaluate whether BMD changes after cessation of ronacaleret treatment .
Method	Observational , off-treatment , extension of a randomized , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging phase II trial .
Method	Fifteen academic centers in seven countries .
Method	Postmenopausal women with low BMD ; @ out of @ women in the parent study were enrolled in the extension study .
Method	Subjects were treated with ronacaleret @mg ( n = @ ) , @mg ( n = @ ) , @mg ( n = @ ) , or @mg ( n = @ ) once daily , alendronate @mg ( n = @ ) once weekly , or matching placebo ( n = @ ) for @-@months ; BMD was measured after discontinuation of ronacaleret or alendronate treatment .
Method	Mean percent change in lumbar spine areal BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at @-@months after discontinuing ronacaleret or alendronate compared with the @ - to @-month BMD measurement of the parent study .
Result	At the lumbar spine , all doses of ronacaleret resulted in gains in BMD while on treatment .
Result	These increases in BMD were maintained or increased after discontinuation of ronacaleret .
Result	All doses of ronacaleret caused bone loss at the total hip while on active treatment .
Result	However , there was an attenuation of this loss in the off-treatment extension study .
Conclusion	The gain in BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained post-treatment and the loss of BMD at the total hip was attenuated .
Conclusion	We hypothesize that there may have been some bone remineralization after cessation of ronacaleret .

Problem	To understand whether using oral contraceptive pills ( OCPs ) results in temporary interruption of bleeding for etonogestrel contraceptive implant users during a @-day course .
Method	In this double-blind trial , we randomly assigned etonogestrel implant users reporting @ consecutive days or more of bothersome bleeding to receive @ pills of study drug ( @ microgram levonorgestrel and @ microgram ethinyl estradiol combined OCPs ) or an identical-appearing placebo .
Method	The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group who stopped bleeding during therapy and continued to report no bleeding at the end of therapy .
Method	Prespecified secondary outcomes were number of days until temporary interruption of bleeding occurred , number of days without bleeding during therapy , and number of days to recurrence of bleeding after discontinuation of therapy .
Method	We hypothesized that temporary interruption of bleeding would occur in @ % of the treatment group compared with @ % in the control group ; using @ % power , we needed a sample size of @ women .
Method	We performed intent-to-treat analysis .
Result	From November @ through December @ , @ women were screened and @ were randomized : OCPs ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
Result	The majority was young , Caucasian women with reported bleeding as extremely or very annoying ; groups had similar baseline characteristics .
Result	Participants randomized OCPs were more likely ( @ of @ -LSB- @ % @ % -RSB- compared with six of @ -LSB- @ % @ % -RSB- ) to have a temporary interruption of bleeding during the study drug period ( odds ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @-@ @ ) .
Result	Of women in the OCP arm who had a temporary interruption , @ % had bleeding recurrence within @ days after treatment .
Conclusion	Bothersome bleeding in etonogestrel contraceptive implant users will usually stop with @-day OCP treatment , but bleeding most often resumes within days of treatment cessation .

Problem	Clinical skills expertise can be advanced through accessible and cost-effective video-based observational practice activities .
Problem	Previous findings suggest that the observation of performances of skills that include flaws can be beneficial to trainees .
Problem	Observing the scope of variability within a skilled movement allows learners to develop strategies to manage the potential for and consequences associated with errors .
Problem	This study tests this observational learning approach on the development of the skills of central line insertion ( CLI ) .
Method	Medical trainees with no CLI experience ( n = @ ) were randomised to three observational practice groups : a group which viewed and assessed videos of an expert performing a CLI without any errors ( F ) ; a group which viewed and assessed videos that contained a mix of flawless and errorful performances ( E ) , and a group which viewed the same videos as the E group but were also given information concerning the correctness of their assessments ( FA ) .
Method	All participants interacted with their observational videos each day for @ days .
Method	Following this period , participants returned to the laboratory and performed a simulation-based insertion , which was assessed using a standard checklist and a global rating scale for the skill .
Method	These ratings served as the dependent measures for analysis .
Result	The checklist analysis revealed no differences between observational learning groups ( grand mean standard error : -LSB- @ @ -RSB- / @ ) .
Result	However , the global rating analysis revealed a main effect of group ( d.f. @,@ = @ , p = @ ) , which describes better CLI performance in the FA group , compared with the F and E groups .
Conclusion	Observational practice that includes errors improves the global performance aspects of clinical skill learning as long as learners are given confirmation that what they are observing is errorful .
Conclusion	These findings provide a refined perspective on the optimal organisation of skill education programmes that combine physical and observational practice activities .

Background	Current thinking , which is based mainly on rodent studies , is that physiologic doses of folic acid ( pterylmonoglutamic acid ) , such as dietary vitamin folates , are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate , @-methyltetrahydrofolic acid ( @-MTHF ) before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply .
Problem	We tested the assumption that , in humans , folic acid is biotransformed ( reduced and methylated ) to @-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa .
Method	We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate @-formyltetrahydrofolic acid ( @-FormylTHF ) in @ subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt ( TIPSS ) in situ .
Method	The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein .
Result	Fifteen minutes after a dose of folic acid , @ @ % of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid .
Result	In contrast , after a dose of labeled @-FormylTHF , only @ @ % of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified @-FormylTHF , and the rest had been converted to @-MTHF after @ min ( postdose ) .
Conclusion	The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to @-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid .
Conclusion	Therefore , large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) capacity that is necessary to produce tetrahydrofolic acid before sequential methylation to @-MTHF .
Conclusion	This process would suggest that humans are reliant on the liver for folic acid reduction even though it has a low and highly variable DHFR activity .
Conclusion	Therefore , chronic liver exposure to folic acid in humans may induce saturation , which would possibly explain reports of systemic circulation of unmetabolized folic acid .

Background	Our objective was to assess therapeutic non-inferiority of dual treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir and lamivudine to triple treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir plus two nucleos ( t ) ides for maintenance of HIV-@ viral suppression .
Method	In this randomised , open-label , non-inferiority trial , we recruited patients from @ HIV units in hospitals in Spain and France .
Method	Eligible patients were HIV-infected adults ( aged @ years ) with HIV-@ RNA of less than @ copies per mL , for at least @ months on triple treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir ( twice daily ) plus lamivudine or emtricitabine and a second nucleos ( t ) ide , with no resistance or virological failure to these drugs , and no positive hepatitis B serum surface antigen .
Method	Investigators at each centre randomly assigned patients ( @:@ ; block size of four ; stratified by time to suppression -LSB- < @ year or > @ year -RSB- and nadir CD@ cell count -LSB- < @ cells per L or > @ cells per L -RSB- ; computer-generated random sequence ) to continue triple treatment or switch to dual treatment ( oral lopinavir @ mg and oral ritonavir @ mg twice daily plus oral lamivudine @ mg once daily ) .
Method	The primary endpoint was response to treatment in the intention-to-treat population ( all randomised patients ) at @ weeks .
Method	The non-inferiority margin was @ % .
Method	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	Between Oct @ , @ , and April @ , @ , we randomly assigned @ participants to continue triple treatment ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) or switch to dual treatment ( @ -LSB- @ % -RSB- patients ) .
Result	In the intention-to-treat population , @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in the triple-treatment group responded to treatment versus @ ( @ % ) of @ in the dual-treatment group ( difference -@ % -LSB- @ % CI -@ to @ -RSB- ; p = @ ) , meeting the criteria for non-inferiority .
Result	Serious adverse events occurred in eight ( @ % ) patients in the triple-treatment group and five ( @ % ) in the dual-treatment group ( p = @ ) , and study drug discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in four ( @ % ) in the triple-treatment group and one ( @ % ) in the dual-treatment group ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Dual treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir plus lamivudine has non-inferior therapeutic efficacy and is similarly tolerated to triple treatment .

Problem	The control of body lice in homeless persons remains a challenge .
Problem	To determine whether the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated underwear provides effective long-term protection against body lice in homeless persons .
Method	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in February and December @ in @ homeless shelters ( Madrague Ville and Forbin ) in Marseille , France .
Method	Of the @ homeless persons screened for eligibility , @ body lice-infested homeless persons , @ years or older , were enrolled .
Method	Body lice-infested homeless persons were randomly assigned to receive @ % permethrin-impregnated underwear or an identical-appearing placebo for @ days , in a @:@ ratio , with a permuted block size of @ .
Method	Visits were scheduled at days @ and @ .
Method	Data regarding the presence or absence of live body lice were collected .
Method	The primary and secondary end points were the proportions of homeless persons free of body lice on days @ and @ , respectively .
Method	Mutations associated with permethrin resistance in the body lice were also identified .
Result	Significantly more homeless persons receiving permethrin-impregnated underwear than homeless persons receiving the placebo were free of body lice on day @ in the intent-to-treat population ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) , with a between-group difference of @ percentage points ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and in the per-protocol population ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) , with a between-group difference of @ percentage points ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
Result	This difference was not sustained on day @ .
Result	At baseline , the prevalence of the permethrin-resistant haplotype was @ % in the permethrin group and @ % in the placebo group .
Result	On day @ , the permethrin-resistant haplotype was significantly more frequent in the permethrin group than in the placebo group ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
Conclusion	Permethrin-impregnated underwear is more efficient than placebo at eliminating body louse infestations by day @ ; however , this difference was not sustained on day @ .
Conclusion	The use of permethrin may have increased the resistance to permethrin in body lice and thus must be avoided .

Background	Preincisional analgesia is an antinociceptive treatment that prevents altered central excitability from high-intensity noxious stimuli .

Conclusion	This randomized trial will provide an opportunity to evaluate products such as whitening strips in comparison to other self-administered methods , especially in adolescents .

Background	TTP@ , an antagonist at the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products , was evaluated as a potential treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
Background	A previous report describes decreased decline in ADAS-cog ( delta = @ , p = @ at @ months , ANCOVA with multiple imputation ) , relative to placebo , following a @ mg/day dose of TTP@ .
Background	Acute , reversible cognitive worsening was seen with a @ mg/day dose .
Background	The present study further evaluates the efficacy of TTP@ by subgroup analyses based on disease severity and concentration effect analysis .
Method	@ patients were randomized to one of two oral TTP@ doses ( @ mg for @ days followed by @ mg/day ; @ mg for @ days followed by @ mg/day ) or placebo for @ months .
Method	Pre-specified primary analysis , using an ITT population , was on the ADAS-cog@ .
Method	Secondary analyses included as a key secondary variable the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes ( CDR-SB ) , and another secondary variable of the ADCS-ADL .
Result	On-treatment analysis demonstrated numerical differences favoring @ mg/day over placebo , with nominal significance at Month @ ( delta = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	Patients with mild AD , whether defined by MMSE or ADAS-cog , demonstrated significant differences favoring @ mg/day on ADAS-cog and trends on CDR-sb and ADCS-ADL at Month @ .
Result	TTP@ plasma concentrations of @-@ @ ng/mL were associated with a decreased decline in ADAS-cog over time compared to placebo .
Result	Worsening on the ADAS-cog relative to placebo was evident at @-@ @ ng/mL .
Conclusion	Results of these analyses support further investigation of @ mg/day in future Phase @ trials in patients with mild AD .

Background	Liver-selective thyromimetic agents could provide a new approach for treating dyslipidaemia .
Method	We performed a multicentre , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eprotirome , a liver-selective thyroid hormone receptor agonist , in @ patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia .
Method	After previous drug wash-out and dietary run-in , patients received @ or @ g day ( -@ ) eprotirome or placebo for @ weeks .
Method	The primary end-point was change in serum LDL cholesterol ; secondary end-points included changes in other lipid parameters and safety measures .
Result	Eprotirome treatment at @ and @ g daily reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels by @ @ % and @ @ % , respectively , compared with @ @ % for placebo ( P < @ ) .
Result	Similar reductions were seen in non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein ( apo ) B , whereas serum levels of HDL cholesterol and apo A-I were unchanged .
Result	There were also considerable reductions in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein ( a ) , in particular in patients with elevated levels at baseline .
Result	There was no evidence of adverse effects on heart or bone and no changes in serum thyrotropin or triiodothyronine , although the thyroxine level decreased .
Result	Low-grade increases in liver enzymes were evident in most patients .
Conclusion	In hypercholesterolaemic patients , the liver-selective thyromimetic eprotirome decreased serum levels of atherogenic lipoproteins without signs of extra-hepatic side effects .
Conclusion	Selective stimulation of hepatic thyroid hormone receptors may be an attractive way to modulate lipid metabolism in hyperlipidaemia .

Background	The classification of clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly still remains a challenge .
Background	The aim of this study was to focus on the interaction of the pathologically altered right heart with the anatomically-supposedly-normal left heart and to derive from cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) a simple imaging measure for the clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly .
Result	Twenty-five patients at a mean age of @ years with unrepaired Ebstein anomaly were examined in a prospective study .
Result	Disease severity was classified using CMR volumes and functional measurements in comparison with heart failure markers from clinical data , ECG , laboratory and cardiopulmonary exercise testing , and echocardiography .
Result	All examinations were completed within @ hours .
Result	A total right/left-volume index was defined from end-diastolic volume measurements in CMR : total right/left-volume index = ( RA + aRV + fRV ) / ( LA+LV ) .
Result	Mean total right/left-volume index was @ ( normal values : @ ) .
Result	This new total right/left-volume index correlated with almost all clinically used biomarkers of heart failure : brain natriuretic peptide ( r = @ ; P = @ ) , QRS ( r = @ ; P = @ ) , peak oxygen consumption/kg ( r = -@ ; P = @ ) , ventilatory response to carbon dioxide production at anaerobic threshold ( r = @ ; P = @ ) , the severity of tricuspid regurgitation ( r = @ ; P = @ ) , tricuspid valve offset ( r = @ ; P = @ ) , and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( r = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	Previously described severity indices ( -LSB- RA + aRV -RSB- / -LSB- fRV + LA+LV -RSB- ) and fRV/LV end-diastolic volume corresponded only to some parameters .
Conclusion	In patients with Ebstein anomaly , the easily acquired index of right-sided to left-sided heart volumes from CMR correlated well with established heart failure markers .
Conclusion	Our data suggest that the total right/left-volume index should be used as a new and simplified CMR measure , allowing more accurate assessment of disease severity than previously described scoring systems .

Background	EORTC trial @ examined the addition of preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer .
Background	After a median follow-up of @ years , chemotherapy-irrespective of timing-significantly improved local control .
Background	Adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve survival , but the Kaplan-Meier curves diverged , suggesting possible delayed benefit .
Background	Here , we report the updated long-term results .
Method	We randomly assigned patients with clinical stage T@ or T@ resectable rectal cancer to receive preoperative radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy before surgery followed by either adjuvant chemotherapy or surveillance .
Method	Randomisation was done using minimisation with factors of institution , sex , T stage , and distance from the tumour to the anal verge .
Method	Study coordinators , clinicians , and patients were aware of assignment .
Method	Radiotherapy consisted of @ Gy to the posterior pelvis in @ fractions of @ Gy over @ weeks .
Method	Each course of chemotherapy consisted of fluorouracil ( @ mg/m ( @ ) per day intravenous bolus ) and folinic acid ( leucovorin ; @ mg/m ( @ ) per day intravenous bolus ) .
Method	For preoperative chemotherapy , two courses were given ( during weeks @ and @ of radiotherapy ) .
Method	Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in four cycles , every @ weeks .
Method	The primary endpoint was overall survival .
Method	This analysis was done by intention to treat .
Method	The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
Result	@ patients were randomly assigned to treatment between April , @ , and March , @ ( @ to preoperative radiotherapy and @ to each of the other three groups ) .
Result	After a median follow-up of @ years ( IQR @-@ ) , @-year overall survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) for the preoperative radiotherapy group and @ % ( @-@ ) for the preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
Result	@-year overall survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) for the adjuvant chemotherapy group and @ % ( @-@ ) for the surveillance group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ , p = @ ) .
Result	@-year disease-free survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) for the preoperative radiotherapy group and @ % ( @-@ ) for the preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
Result	@-year disease-free survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) for the adjuvant chemotherapy group and @ % ( @-@ ) for the surveillance group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ , p = @ ) .
Result	At @ years , cumulative incidence of local relapse was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) with radiotherapy alone , @ % ( @-@ ) with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy , @ % ( @-@ ) with radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy and @ % ( @-@ ) with both adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( p = @ ) .
Result	There was no difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastases ( p = @ ) .
Result	The frequency of long-term side-effects did not differ between the four groups ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemotherapy after preoperative radiotherapy ( with or without chemotherapy ) does not affect disease-free survival or overall survival .
Conclusion	Our trial does not support the current practice of adjuvant chemotherapy after preoperative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy .
Conclusion	New treatment strategies incorporating neoadjuvant chemotherapy are required .

Background	Breast neoplasms are the second most common type of cancer worldwide , and radiation therapy is a key component of their treatment .
Background	Acute skin reactions are one of the most common side effects of radiation therapy , and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies .
Background	However , a clinically applicable , preventative treatment remains unavailable .
Background	It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair .
Background	Therefore , the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus ( InGaAIP ) laser operated at @nm in preventing radiodermatitis in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer .
Method	This is a two-arm , randomized controlled trial .
Method	A total of @ patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer ( stages I to III ) will be enrolled .
Method	Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy ( n = @ ) or a control group to receive a placebo ( n = @ ) .
Method	The laser or placebo will be applied five days a week , immediately before each radiotherapy session .
Method	Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse , a radiotherapist , and an oncologist ( all of whom will be blinded ) using the Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group .
Method	Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain ( a self-evaluation questionnaire ) .
Method	Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of radiodermatitis and pain secondary to radiodermatitis , respectively .
Conclusion	The ideal tool for preventing radiodermatitis is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation .
Conclusion	Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis .
Conclusion	Moreover , this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective .
Conclusion	Thus , the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of radiodermatitis .

Background	Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine are first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Cameroon .
Background	No study has yet compared the efficacy of these drugs following the WHO recommended @-day follow-up period .
Background	The goal of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy , tolerability and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) , artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) and dihydroartemisinin piperaquine ( DHAP ) among children aged less than ten years in two malaria-endemic ecological regions of Cameroon .

Result	There were no statistical significant differences in parasite or fever clearance times between treatments , although fever clearance pattern was different between ASAQ and DHAP .
Result	No statistical significant differences were observed in the occurrence of adverse events among treatment groups .
Conclusion	ASAQ and DHAP are considered safe and tolerable and are not inferior to AL in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Cameroonian children .

Problem	Fatigue is a common problem among multiple myeloma ( MM ) patients .
Problem	Armodafinil is a drug known to promote wakefulness , which is related to modafinil , a compound that improves fatigue in some cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents .
Problem	We investigated whether armodafinil could reduce cancer-related fatigue in MM patients .
Method	This double-blind , placebo-controlled phase @ trial evaluated the efficacy of armodafinil in MM patients with evidence of moderate fatigue .
Method	Patients were randomized to one of two arms : treatment-only , with armodafinil given at @ mg/daily for @ days , or placebo-first , with placebo given on days @-@ , followed by armodafinil administered at @ mg daily on days @-@ .
Method	Fatigue was measured on days @ ( pre-dose : baseline ) , @ , @ , @ , and @ using seven separate assessments , including four patient-reported outcomes of fatigue and related quality of life measures , as well as three objective measures of cognitive function .
Result	Overall toxicities were similar between treatment groups .
Result	No significant differences were observed between the placebo-first and the treatment-only arms after @ days .
Result	Treatment with armodafinil for @ additional days did not produce responses .
Result	Both placebo-first and treatment-only patients showed similar significant improvements in three patient-reported measures and one objective task at day @ compared to baseline .
Result	Placebo-first patients improved on eight additional measures ( one patient-reported measure , six subscales , and one objective task ) , suggesting a strong placebo effect in this patient population .
Conclusion	Evaluation and treatment of cancer-related fatigue continues to be challenging ; a clear definition of this symptom and better assessment tools are needed .

Problem	To determine the effectiveness of a pedometer-based telephone lifestyle coaching intervention on weight and physical activity .
Method	A randomized controlled trial was conducted with @ patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation in rural and urban Australia .
Method	Participants were allocated to a healthy weight ( HW ) ( @ telephone coaching sessions on weight and physical activity ) or a physical activity ( PA ) intervention ( @ telephone coaching sessions on physical activity ) .
Method	Weight and physical activity were assessed by self-report at baseline , short-term ( @-@ weeks ) , and medium-term ( @-@ months ) .
Result	More than @ % of participants completed the trial .
Result	Over the medium-term , participants in the HW group decreased their weight compared with participants in the PA group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Participants in the HW group with a body mass index of @ kg/m had a mean weight loss of @ kg compared with participants in the PA-only group who lost a mean of @ kg ( P = @ ) .
Result	Short-term , both groups increased their physical activity time , and the PA group maintained this increase at the medium-term .
Conclusion	Participants in the HW group achieved modest improvements in weight , and those in the PA group demonstrated increased physical activity .
Conclusion	Low-contact , telephone-based interventions are a feasible means of delivering lifestyle interventions for underserved rural communities , for those not attending cardiac rehabilitation , or as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation .

Background	Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of COPD ( AECOPDs ) pose burdens to the health-care system and patients .
Background	A current gap in knowledge is whether a predischarge screening and educational tool administered to patients with COPD reduces readmissions and ED visits .
Method	A single-center , randomized trial of admitted patients with AECOPDs was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital between February @ and April @ .
Method	One hundred seventy-two patients were randomized to either the control ( standard care ) or the bundle group in which patients received smoking cessation counseling , screening for gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression or anxiety , standardized inhaler education , and a @-h postdischarge telephone call .
Method	The primary end point was the difference in the composite risk of hospitalizations or ED visits for AECOPD between the two groups in the @ days following discharge .
Method	A secondary end point was @-day readmission rate .
Result	Of the @ patients , @ of @ in the control group ( @ % ) and @ of @ in the bundle group ( @ % ) were readmitted within @ days .
Result	The risk of ED visits or hospitalizations within @ days was not different between the groups ( risk difference , -@ % ; @ % CI , -@ % to @ % ; P = @ ) .
Result	Overall , the time to readmission in @ and @ days was similar between groups ( log-rank test P = @ and @ , respectively ) .
Conclusion	A predischarge bundle intervention in AECOPD is not sufficient to reduce the @-day risk of hospitalizations or ED visits .
Conclusion	More resources may be needed to generate a measurable effect on readmission rates .

Background	ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses lung injury from both direct and indirect sources .
Background	Direct ARDS ( pneumonia , aspiration ) has been hypothesized to cause more severe lung epithelial injury than indirect ARDS ( eg , nonpulmonary sepsis ) ; however , this hypothesis has not been well studied in humans .
Method	We measured plasma biomarkers of lung epithelial and endothelial injury and inflammation in a single-center study of @ patients with ARDS and severe sepsis and in a secondary analysis of @ patients with ARDS drawn from a multicenter randomized controlled trial .
Method	Biomarker levels in patients with direct vs indirect ARDS were compared in both cohorts .
Result	In both studies , patients with direct ARDS had significantly higher levels of a biomarker of lung epithelial injury ( surfactant protein D ) and significantly lower levels of a biomarker of endothelial injury ( angiopoietin-@ ) than those with indirect ARDS .
Result	These associations were robust to adjustment for severity of illness and ARDS severity .
Result	In the multicenter study , patients with direct ARDS also had lower levels of von Willebrand factor antigen and IL-@ and IL-@ , markers of endothelial injury and inflammation , respectively .
Result	The prognostic value of the biomarkers was similar in direct and indirect ARDS .
Conclusion	Direct lung injury in humans is characterized by a molecular phenotype consistent with more severe lung epithelial injury and less severe endothelial injury .
Conclusion	The opposite pattern was identified in indirect lung injury .
Conclusion	Clinical trials of novel therapies targeted specifically at the lung epithelium or endothelium may benefit from preferentially enrolling patients with direct and indirect ARDS , respectively .

Background	Measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation helps determine whether cardiac output and oxygen delivery are sufficient for metabolic needs .
Background	As recommended by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses guideline , blood samples for determining mixed venous oxygen saturation are obtained by slowly , in @ to @ minutes , withdrawing @ mL of blood from the distal port of the pulmonary artery catheter .
Background	In theory , the negative force of rapid withdrawal could pull oxygenated blood from the pulmonary capillary bed , causing falsely elevated saturation values .
Problem	To determine if the speed of withdrawal affects oxygen content in blood samples used to measure mixed venous oxygen saturation .
Method	The sample consisted of heart failure patients with pulmonary artery catheters admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit .
Method	A prospective , randomized , @ @ crossover design was used to compare mixed venous oxygen saturation in blood samples obtained quickly or slowly .
Method	A total of @ sets of saturation values were analyzed .
Method	Each set included @ blood sample obtained slowly , in @ to @ minutes , and @ obtained rapidly , in @ seconds .
Result	The mean difference in saturation values between the fast and the slow groups was -@ ( CI , -@ to @ ; P = @ ) , indicating that no meaningful systematic bias is attributable to fast withdrawal of blood .
Conclusion	Rapid blood sampling does not falsely elevate measurements of mixed venous oxygen saturation .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of core stabilization exercise with real-time feedback on balance and gait function in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke .

Method	Subjects in the experimental group performed core stabilization exercise with real-time feedback training for @ minutes per day during a period of six weeks .
Method	Subjects in the control group performed core stabilization exercise during the same period .
Method	This study assessed the kinematic parameters using a portable walkway system , and timed up-and-go test .
Result	Gait velocity showed significantly greater improvement in the experimental group ( @ @ sec ) than in the control group ( -@ @ ) .
Result	Stride length showed significantly greater increase in the experimental group ( @ @ on the affected side and @ @ on the less affected side ) than the control group ( @ @ on the affected side and @ @ on the less affected side ) .
Result	After training , change in results on the timed up and go test was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group .
Conclusion	Core stabilization exercise using real-time feedback produces greater improvement in gait performance in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients than core stabilization exercise only .

Method	High-sensitivity C-reactive protein , cardiac troponin , and creatine kinaseMB levels were measured before surgery and @ days postoperatively .
Result	AF occurred in @ % of the levosimendan group and @ % of the control group .
Result	The occurrence of AF was significantly lower in the levosimendan group ( P < @ ) .
Result	The duration of AF in the levosimendan group was significantly shorter than that in the control group ( @ @ and @ @ hours , respectively ; P = @ ) .
Result	Our research showed that C-reactive protein was higher postoperatively in the control group than in the levosimendan group ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The incidence of postoperative AF in the levosimendan group was reduced significantly in patients with poor left ventricle function after CABG operations .

Background	High level of serum cholesterol is considered to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
Background	A double-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled trial was performed to test the hypothesis that a daily intake of Chlorella may improve serum lipid profile through enhancement of serum carotenoid concentration in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects .
Method	Eligible subjects ( n = @ ) were randomized to either Chlorella ( @g/day ) or placebo for a double-blinded trial with a @-week lead-in period and a @-week intervention period .
Method	Serum triglycerides , total cholesterol , lipoproteins , apolipoproteins and carotenoids were assessed at the beginning and the end of the trial .
Result	Compared with the control group , the Chlorella group exhibited remarkable changes in total cholesterol ( Chlorella -@ % ; placebo @ % ; P = @ ) , triglycerides ( Chlorella -@ % ; placebo @ % ; P = @ ) , lutein/zeaxanthin ( Chlorella @ % ; placebo -@ % ; P < @ ) , and - carotene ( Chlorella @ % ; placebo @ % ; P < @ ) .
Result	Improvement of serum lipids was supported by significant reductions of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( Chlorella -@ % ; placebo @ % ; P = @ ) , apolipoprotein B ( Chlorella -@ % ; placebo @ % ; P = @ ) , non high-density lipoprotein ( Chlorella -@ % ; placebo -@ % ; P = @ ) , and high-density lipoprotein/triglycerides ( Chlorella @ % ; placebo -@ % ; P = @ ) , suggesting an inhibitory effect of Chlorella on the intestinal absorption of dietary and endogenous lipids .
Result	Further , the changes of serum lipids appeared to be associated with the changes of serum carotenoids .
Conclusion	Daily consumption of Chlorella supplements provided the potential of health benefits reducing serum lipid risk factors , mainly triglycerides and total cholesterol , in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects .
Conclusion	The effect was related to carotenoid consumption .

Background	To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the combined regimen ( consisting of condoms and emergency contraception pills ( ECP ) ) and using condoms only for the purpose of preventing pregnancy .
Method	One-thousand-five-hundred-and-sixty-two ( @,@ ) couples as volunteers enrolled at nine centers in Shanghai .
Method	Eight-hundred-and-twelve ( @ ) were randomized to use male condoms and ECP ( i.e. , Levonorgestrel ) as a back-up to condoms ( the intervention group ) and @ to use male condoms only ( the control group ) , according to their working unit .
Method	Participants were visited at admission and at the end of @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ months .
Method	The cumulative life table rates were calculated for pregnancy and other reasons for discontinuation .

Result	The cumulative gross pregnancy rate of the condoms plus emergency contraception group and the condoms only group were @ and @ , respectively , per @ women ( @ = @ , p = @ ) .
Result	The Pearl Index in the condoms plus emergency contraception group and the condoms only group were @ % and @ % , respectively .
Conclusion	Male condoms remain a highly effective contraceptive method for a period of one year while consistently and correctly used .
Conclusion	In addition , the lowest pregnancy rate followed from perfect use condom .

Background	Complaints of knee pain secondary to early osteoarthritis may account for up to @ % of visits to primary care physicians .
Background	Due to the proposed inflammatory changes in early osteoarthritis , intra-articular injections of corticosteroids ( IACS ) have been considered as an option for disease progression modification , pain control , and improvement of function .
Background	However , some studies have suggested poor accuracy rates of IA injections depending on the entry site chosen .
Background	It is therefore the aim of this study to evaluate the efficacy of IA knee corticosteroid injection in reducing pain and improving function in patients with early osteoarthritis and whether the low accuracy rates reported with the Anterolateral joint line injection site translate to worse functional and pain outcome measures as compared to Suprapatellar lateral injections .
Method	The study was carried out as an open-label , randomized controlled trial with @ sequential patients recruited .
Method	Simple randomization separated groups into anterolateral joint line or suprapatellar lateral injection sites .
Method	Improvements were measured with WOMAC and VAS scores after injection of Lidocaine and steroid solution .
Result	Patients receiving IACS injections had a measurable improvement in self-reported outcomes as evidenced by standard deviation change in WOMAC and VAS scores .
Result	The majority of patients had a clinically significant improvement in VAS scores as compared to their initial measures with a notable amount of patients improving significantly as well on their WOMAC scores , irrespective of the injection site chosen .
Conclusion	We have therefore continued the use of palpation-guided intra-articular knee injections in an effort to reduce costs as compared to other injection modalities with positive results in our osteoarthritis patients .

Background	Enzalutamide is an oral androgen-receptor inhibitor that prolongs survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in whom the disease has progressed after chemotherapy .
Background	New treatment options are needed for patients with metastatic prostate cancer who have not received chemotherapy , in whom the disease has progressed despite androgen-deprivation therapy .
Method	In this double-blind , phase @ study , we randomly assigned @ patients to receive either enzalutamide ( at a dose of @ mg ) or placebo once daily .
Method	The coprimary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival .
Result	The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis , conducted when @ deaths had been reported , showed a benefit of the active treatment .
Result	The rate of radiographic progression-free survival at @ months was @ % among patients treated with enzalutamide , as compared with @ % among patients receiving placebo ( @ % risk reduction ; hazard ratio in the enzalutamide group , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) in the enzalutamide group , as compared with @ patients ( @ % ) in the placebo group , were alive at the data-cutoff date ( @ % reduction in the risk of death ; hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	The benefit of enzalutamide was shown with respect to all secondary end points , including the time until the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy ( hazard ratio , @ ) , the time until the first skeletal-related event ( hazard ratio , @ ) , a complete or partial soft-tissue response ( @ % vs. @ % ) , the time until prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression ( hazard ratio , @ ) , and a rate of decline of at least @ % in PSA ( @ % vs. @ % ) ( P < @ for all comparisons ) .

Background	Black men exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as well as a higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher mortality rates from prostate cancer than Whites .
Background	There are few data about the effect of vitamin D@ ( cholecalciferol ) supplementation on prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) in healthy Black men .
Method	During three winters from @ to @ , @ Black men ( median age , @ years ) of Boston , MA were randomized into a four-arm , double-blind trial for @ months of placebo , @,@ , @,@ , or @,@ U of vitamin D@ .
Method	At baseline and @ months , free and total PSA was measured .
Result	With vitamin D supplementation , no significant differences in free and total PSA were observed ; free PSA , -@ ng/mL ( P = @ ) and total PSA , -@ ng/mL ( P = @ ) for each additional @,@ U/d of vitamin D@ .
Conclusion	Within an unselected population of healthy Black men without a cancer diagnosis , we found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on free or total PSA .
Conclusion	These findings support prior findings of no change in PSA with vitamin D supplementation and emphasize the need for new methods to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on prostate cancer prevention .

Problem	To compare the patients ' compliance with and the efficacy of existing treatments for Helicobacter pylori eradication , including moxifloxacin-based triple therapy , sequential treatment and the standard treatment .
Method	Patients with H.pylori infection were randomly assigned to three therapy groups .
Method	The triple therapy ( MML ) group was given moxifloxacin @mg/day , metronidazole @mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole @mg b.i.d. for @ days .
Method	The sequential treatment ( AL-CML ) group was administrated amoxicillin @g b.i.d. and lansoprazole @mg b.i.d. for the first @ days , followed by clarithromycin @mg b.i.d. , metronidazole @mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole @mg b.i.d. for the second @ days .
Method	The standard treatment ( CAL ) group received amoxicillin @g b.i.d. , clarithromycin @mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole @mg b.i.d. for @ days .
Method	The eradication rates were evaluated by per-protocol ( PP ) analysis and intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis .
Result	The eradication rates were @ , @ and @ % by PP analysis and @ , @ and @ % by ITT analysis in the MML , AL-CML and CAL group , respectively , and patients ' compliance rates were @ , @ and @ % , respectively .
Result	There were no significant differences in treatment efficacy and compliance rates in the MML , AL-CML and CAL groups ( P > @ ) .
Conclusion	The present study revealed that standard triple therapy , sequential therapy and moxifloxacin-based triple therapy are all effective treatment regimens in terms of H.pylori eradication rates and compliance with therapy in Turkey .

Problem	Does substituting @ g corifollitropin alfa for @ IU follitropin beta during the first @ days of ovarian stimulation in proven poor responders , result in retrieval of a non-inferior number ( < @ fewer ) of cumulus oocyte complexes ( COCs ) ?
Conclusion	A single s.c. dose of @ g corifollitropin alfa on the first day of ovarian stimulation , followed if necessary , from Day @ onwards , with @ IU of follitropin beta/day , is not inferior to daily doses of @ IU follitropin beta .
Conclusion	The @ % CI of the difference between medians in the number of oocytes retrieved was -@ to +@ within the safety margin of @ .
Background	Recent data from retrospective studies suggest that the use of corifollitropin alfa in poor responders is promising since it could simplify ovarian stimulation without compromising its outcome .
Method	Seventy-nine women with previous poor ovarian response undergoing ICSI treatment were enrolled in this open label , non-inferiority , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) .
Method	Inclusion criteria were : previous poor response to ovarian stimulation ( @ COCs ) after maximal stimulation , age < @ years , regular spontaneous menstrual cycle , body mass index : @-@ kg/m ( @ ) and basal follicle stimulating hormone @ IU/l .
Method	On Day @ of the menstrual cycle , patients were administered either a single s.c dose of @ g corifollitropin alfa ( n = @ ) or a fixed daily dose of @ IU of follitropin beta ( n = @ ) .
Method	In the corifollitropin alfa group , @ IU of follitropin beta were administered from Day @ of stimulation until the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) administration , if necessary .
Method	To inhibit premature luteinizing hormone surge , the gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist ganirelix was used .
Method	Triggering of final oocyte maturation was performed using @ g of recombinant hCG , when at least two follicles reached @ mm in mean diameter .
Result	The number of COCs retrieved was not statistically different between the corifollitropin alfa and the follitropin beta groups -LSB- Median @ versus @ , @ % CI @-@ , @-@ , respectively , P = @ -RSB- .
Result	The @ % CI of the difference between medians in the number of oocytes retrieved was -@ to +@ .
Result	A multivariable analysis adjusting for all the potential baseline differences confirmed this finding .
Result	No significant difference was observed regarding the probability of live birth between the corifollitropin alfa and the follitropin beta group ( live birth per patient reaching oocyte retrieval : @ versus @ % , respectively , difference +@ % , @ % CI : -@ to +@ ) .
Conclusion	The present study was not powered to test a smaller difference ( e.g. @ COC ) in terms of COCs retrieved as well as to show potential differences in the probability of pregnancy .
Conclusion	Moreover , it would be interesting to assess whether the continuation of stimulation in the long acting FSH arm , where necessary , with @ IU instead of @ IU of follitropin beta would have altered the direction or the magnitude of the effect of the type of FSH , observed on the number of COCs retrieved .
Conclusion	Corifollitropin alfa simplifies IVF treatment because it is administered in a GnRH antagonist protocol and replaces seven daily FSH injections with a single one of a long acting FSH without compromising the outcome .
Conclusion	It could greatly reduce the burden of treatment for poor responders and this deserves further investigation .

Background	Although BiPAP has been used as an adjunct to exercise , little is know about its effect on exercise in COPD .
Background	We aimed to evaluate the acute effect of BiPAP delivered with a standard valve ( Vision , Respironics ) , compared to no assist , on exercise capacity in individuals with COPD .
Method	Peak exercise workload ( WLpeak ) , dyspnea ( Borg ) , end-expiratory lung volume ( EELV ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , minute ventilation ( VE ) , O@ uptake ( VO@ ) , and CO@ production ( VCO@ ) were assessed in @ COPD patients ( FEV@ @ @ % pred ) during three symptom-limited bicycle exercise tests while breathing i ) without a ventilator ( noPS ) , ii ) with a pressure support ( PS ) of @ cm H@O ( PS@ ; IPAP & EPAP @ cm H@O ) and iii ) PS of @ cm H@O ( PS@ ; IPAP @ & EPAP @ cm H@O ) on separate days using a randomized crossover design .
Result	WLpeak was significantly lower with PS@ ( @ @ ) and PS@ ( @ @ ) than noPS ( @ @ ) ( p < @ ) .
Result	Dyspnea at peak exercise was similar with noPS , PS@ and PS@ ; at isoload it was lower with noPS compared to PS@ and PS@ ( p < @ ) .
Result	VT and VE were highest with PS@ and lowest with noPS both at peak exercise and isoload ( p < @ ) .
Result	EELV was similar at peak exercise with all three conditions .
Result	VO@ and VCO@ were greater with PS@ and PS@ than noPS ( p < @ ) , both at peak exercise and isoload .
Conclusion	Use of BiPAP with a standard exhalation valve during exercise increases VT and VE at the expense of augmenting VCO@ and dyspnea , which in turns reduces WLpeak in COPD patients .

Problem	To evaluate the performance ( efficacy , safety and acceptability ) of a new micro-adherent absorbent dressing ( UrgoClean ) compared with a hydrofiber dressing ( Aquacel ) in the local management of venous leg ulcers , in the debridement stage .
Method	A non-inferiority European randomised controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) was conducted in @ centres , on patients presenting with venous or predominantly venous , mixed aetiology leg ulcers at their sloughy stage ( with more than @ % of the wound bed covered with slough at baseline ) .
Method	Patients were followed over a @-week period and assessed weekly .
Method	The primary judgement criteria was the relative regression of the wound surface area after the @-week treatment period .
Method	Secondary endpoints were the relative reduction of sloughy tissue and the percentage of patients presenting with a debrided wound .
Result	Altogether , @ patients were randomised to either UrgoClean ( test group ; n = @ ) or Aquacel ( control group ; n = @ ) dressings .
Result	Regarding the wound healing process predictive factors ( wound area , duration , ABPI value , recurrence ) , at baseline , the two groups were well balanced , for both wound and patient characteristics .
Result	Compression therapy was administered to both groups and after a median @-day treatment period , the percentage of relative reduction of the wound surface area was very similar ( -@ % vs -@ % in the UrgoClean and control groups , respectively ) .
Result	When considering the secondary criteria at week @ , the relative reduction of sloughy tissue was significantly higher in the UrgoClean group than in the control group ( -@ % vs -@,@ % ; p = @ ) .
Result	The percentage of debrided wounds was also significantly higher in the test group ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) .
Conclusion	This ` EARTH ' RCT confirmed that the UrgoClean dressing has similar efficacy and safety compared to Aquacel .
Conclusion	However , UrgoClean also showed better autolytic properties than the control group in the management of venous leg ulcers at the sloughy stage .
Conclusion	The new UrgoClean dressing therefore represents a promising therapeutic option within the current range of autolytic dressings available .

Problem	The prognoses of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ( ICAS ) differ .
Problem	Understanding the underlying pathomechanisms and predictors of progression or regression may help to clarify the differences .
Problem	We herein attempted to compare the course and predictors of symptomatic ICAS to those of coexisting asymptomatic ICAS .
Method	This was a post-hoc analysis of the ` Trials of Cilostazol in Symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis-@ ( TOSS-@ ) ' study , which recruited patients with acute symptomatic ICAS receiving intensive medical treatment .
Method	Changes in the status of ICAS were classified as being indicative of regression , progression or no changes .
Method	Univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of symptomatic and asymptomatic ICAS based on clinical , laboratory and radiologic data .
Result	Of the @ patients , symptomatic ICAS demonstrated regression in @ ( @ % ) cases and progression in @ ( @ % ) cases .
Result	Among these patients , @ ( @ % ) had asymptomatic ICAS , which regressed in @ ( @ % ) cases and progressed in @ ( @ % ) cases .
Result	Severe baseline stenosis , a high high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level and the use of cilostazol were found to be independently associated with a favorable course of symptomatic ICAS ( p@ @ , p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) .
Result	Regarding asymptomatic ICAS , severe stenosis , the use of angiotensin receptor antagonists and a low fasting glucose level were associated with a favorable course ( p@ @ , p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) .
Conclusion	Changes in atherosclerosis are more dynamic in patients with symptomatic ICAS , and the predictors of symptomatic and asymptomatic ICAS differ .
Conclusion	In this study , changes in the status of symptomatic ICAS were associated with the level of HDL cholesterol , which is known to affect the regression of atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling .

Problem	To determine the safety and efficacy of a @ ns Q switched Nd YAG laser vs. a @ ns Q switched Nd YAG laser for clearance of melasma .
Problem	To compare subject satisfaction , efficacy , and comfort level between the two lasers .
Method	This is a prospective , randomized split face clinical study .
Method	The study was approved by the Scripps IRB .
Method	Ten healthy female subjects with moderate to severe melasma were enrolled .
Method	Each subject had three laser treatments one month apart .
Method	Patients were followed up approximately @ month , @ months , and @ months after the final laser treatment .
Method	A treatment session consisted of a microdermabrasion , @ nm QS laser , and topicals .
Method	Subjects were asked to rate treatment pain based on a numerical scale range @-@ ( @ = no pain and @ = worst pain ) .
Method	A melasma area and severity index ( MASI ) grading system was applied .
Method	Also , melanin measurements were acquired by a reflectance spectrophotometer .
Method	Side effects were documented during the study including post treatment erythema .
Result	Eight patients completed the study .
Result	Subjects showed improvement on both sides of the face .
Result	From baseline to @ month post the final laser treatment , the average MASI scores showed a @ % reduction for the @ ns QS @ nm laser vs. a @ % reduction for the @ ns QS @ nm laser ( both significant versus baseline pigment , P < @ ) .
Result	This difference in MASI scores between the two lasers was not statistically significant ( P = @ ) .
Result	Laser treatments displayed mild erythema that resolved after one day .
Result	The melanin meter measurements showed a reduction in pigment readings on both sides .
Result	Three months after the final treatment there was some relapse in the melasma , as the mean pigment reduction fell to @ % for the @ ns laser and @ % for the @ ns laser .
Result	By @ months pigment reduction was not statistically significant for either laser , and no significant differences in pigment reduction were noted between the two pulse durations .
Result	There was a statistically significant difference ( P < @ ) in pain scores reported by the subjects ( scale @-@ ) , the mean pain score for @ ns QS @ nm laser was @ and for the @ ns QS @ the score was @ .
Conclusion	In this study , we showed that a combination of microdermabrasion , QS@ nm laser , and topicals decreased the MASI and meter scores without clinically significant side effects .
Conclusion	Moreover , the longer pulsed Q switched @ nm laser i.e. ( @ ns ) was associated with less pain than its shorter pulse width counterpart .

Background	Agomelatine was efficacious in reducing symptoms in a short-term placebo-controlled trial in generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) and in preventing relapse in a longer term placebo-controlled study .
Background	An additional short-term placebo-controlled study is required by regulatory agencies to confirm the efficacy of agomelatine in GAD .
Method	This @-week , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized , parallel group , international , multicenter study was designed to confirm the efficacy of agomelatine @-@ mg/d in the treatment of patients with a primary DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of GAD .
Method	The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS ) total score .
Method	Assay sensitivity was evaluated by including an escitalopram ( @-@ mg/d ) group .
Method	The study was undertaken in @ clinical centers in Argentina , Czech Republic , Finland , South Korea , Poland , Russia , and Slovakia from April @ to July @ .
Result	One hundred thirty-nine outpatients were included in the agomelatine group , @ in the placebo group , and @ in the escitalopram group .
Result	Agomelatine significantly reduced mean ( SD ) HARS total score ( agomelatine-placebo difference : @ -LSB- @ -RSB- , P < @ ) and had significant effects on secondary outcome measures , including psychic and somatic HARS subscales , response rate ( estimate -LSB- standard error -RSB- ) ( agomelatine-placebo difference : @ % -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P < @ ) , remission on the HARS ( agomelatine-placebo difference : @ % -LSB- @ % -RSB- , P = @ ) , Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( CGI-S ) ( P < @ ) , functional impairment ( P < @ ) , and sleep quality ( P < @ ) .
Result	Findings were confirmed in the subset of more severely ill patients ( HARS total score @ with or without CGI-S @ at baseline ) .
Result	Agomelatine was well tolerated by patients , with no more adverse events than placebo .
Result	Escitalopram was similarly efficacious but was accompanied by a higher incidence of adverse events compared to placebo .
Conclusion	In clinical practice , agomelatine has at least similar efficacy to that of escitalopram for the short-term treatment of GAD and is well tolerated .

Problem	To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) for @ months with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel in Sweden and Denmark .
Method	Decision-analytic model to estimate lifetime costs , life-expectancy , and quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs ) with ticagrelor and clopidogrel .
Method	Event rates , healthcare resource use , and health-related quality of life during @ months of therapy were estimated from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes ( PLATO ) trial .
Method	Beyond @ months , quality-adjusted survival and costs were estimated conditional on events occurring during the @ months of therapy .
Method	When available , country-specific data were employed in the analysis .
Method	Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are presented from a healthcare perspective and a broader societal perspective including costs falling outside the healthcare sector in @ local currency .
Result	The cost per QALY with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel was SEK @ @ and DKK @ @ for Sweden and Denmark , respectively , from a healthcare perspective .
Result	The cost per QALY from a broader societal perspective was SEK @ @ and DKK @ @ for Sweden and Denmark , respectively .
Conclusion	The cost per QALY of treating ACS-patients with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel is below the conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness in Sweden and Denmark .

Background	General practitioners/dermatologists may be aware of musculoskeletal symptoms in patients with psoriasis but may have difficulty accurately detecting psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) .
Problem	We sought to evaluate @ PsA screening questionnaires-the Psoriasis and Arthritis Screening Questionnaire ( PASQ ) , Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool ( PEST ) , and Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screen ( ToPAS ) - based on rheumatologist assessment in patients with psoriasis .
Method	Consecutive unselected patients with psoriasis , initially evaluated by dermatologists for plaque psoriasis , were randomized to receive @ of @ questionnaires .
Method	Patients were subsequently evaluated by rheumatologists to establish/exclude clinical PsA diagnosis .
Method	Using clinical PsA diagnosis as the standard for comparison , questionnaire accuracy was assessed by calculating sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive values .
Result	Of @ patients with psoriasis evaluated by rheumatologists , @ ( @ % ) received a clinical diagnosis of PsA ( @ % confidence interval @ % -@ % ) .
Result	Probable PsA was detected in @ % , @ % , and @ % of patients using PASQ , PEST , and ToPAS , respectively .
Result	Sensitivity ranged from @ to @ ; specificity , @ to @ ; positive predictive value , @ to @ ; and negative predictive value , @ to @ .
Conclusion	Not all patients completed all questionnaires ; lack of standardized diagnostic criteria introduced possible bias .
Conclusion	PASQ , PEST , and ToPAS are useful screening tools that can help dermatologists identifypatients without PsA and patients with possible PsA who may benefit from rheumatologist assessment .

Background	Varenicline , a partial agonist at @ nicotinic receptors ( nAChRs ) aids smoking cessation by reducing craving .
Background	Successful quitting may be associated with greater inhibitory control but the effectiveness of varenicline in this regard is unknown .
Problem	This study aimed to investigate the effect of varenicline on aspects of inhibitory control in smokers .
Method	A double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of varenicline @ mg ( or matched placebo ) in satiated and abstinent smokers .
Method	Tests included Rapid Visual Information Processing ( RVIP ) , Stop-Signal ( SS ) , Prospective Memory ( PM ) and the Cambridge Gambling Task ( CGT ) .
Result	Smoking enhanced RVIP accuracy and latency to respond .
Result	Varenicline did not alter RVIP performance , nor the effect of smoking , suggesting that these effects were unrelated to @ nAChRs .
Result	Smoking increased the number of errors during SS and increased the stop latency , indicating that smoking decreased inhibitory control .
Result	Varenicline partially mimicked this effect of smoking but also reduced the smoking-induced increase , indicating a role for @ nAChRs .
Result	Likewise , smoking increased the number of points bet following a win during CGT and varenicline blocked this effect .
Result	There was no effect of smoking or varenicline on PM target detection per se .
Result	However , smoking protected the target detection rate in the ongoing task when a concurrent intention was introduced .
Result	Varenicline improved response speed in both satiated and abstinent smokers .
Conclusion	Some aspects of inhibitory control may be mediated by @-related mechanisms and blockade of smoking-induced disinhibition may contribute towards the action of varenicline as an aid to smoking cessation .

Problem	We investigated clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with significant valvular disease ( SVD ) in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation ( ROCKET AF ) trial .
Result	ROCKET AF excluded patients with mitral stenosis or artificial valve prostheses .
Result	We used Cox regression to adjust comparisons for potential confounders .
Result	Among @ @ patients , @ ( @ % ) had SVD ; they were older and had more comorbidities than patients without SVD .
Result	The rate of stroke or systemic embolism with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin was consistent among patients with SVD -LSB- @ vs. @ % ; hazard ratio ( HR ) @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- and without SVD ( @ vs. @ % ; HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; interaction P = @ ) .
Result	However , rates of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were higher in patients with SVD ( @ % rivaroxaban vs. @ % warfarin ; HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) vs. those without ( @ % rivaroxaban vs. @ % warfarin ; HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; interaction P = @ ) , even when controlling for risk factors and potential confounders .
Result	In intracranial haemorrhage , there was no interaction between patients with and without SVD where the overall rate was lower among those randomized to rivaroxaban .
Conclusion	Many patients with ` non-valvular atrial fibrillation ' have significant valve lesions .
Conclusion	Their risk of stroke is similar to that of patients without SVD after controlling for stroke risk factors .
Conclusion	Efficacy of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin was similar in patients with and without SVD ; however , the observed risk of bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban in patients with SVD but was the same among those without SVD .
Conclusion	Atrial fibrillation patients with and without SVD experience the same stroke-preventive benefit of oral anticoagulants .

Problem	To determine whether the method of specimen preparation after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate affected core fragmentation , and secondly to determine whether such fragmentation was influenced by the presence of malignancy in the biopsy specimen .
Method	A prospective randomized study comparing @ different mechanisms of specimen preparation , wash vs swipe of biopsy cores , with blinded assessment by a specific uropathologist was undertaken .
Result	For those cores in which prostate cancer was present , the wash method of specimen preparation resulted in fewer and longer core fragments ( P = @ ) .
Result	Those patients in whom cancer was present on biopsy also had a greater degree of biopsy core fragmentation in those cores in which only benign tissue was identified ( P = @ ) .
Result	Gleason score did not appear to influence the extent of fragmentation .
Conclusion	The method of specimen preparation at prostate biopsy influences the degree of fragmentation seen at histologic evaluation .
Conclusion	This has the potential to affect the interpretation of biopsy results , including suitability of patients for inclusion in active surveillance protocols .
Conclusion	Core fragmentation might be minimized by modification of technique .

Background	Introduction of calcineurin inhibitors had led to improved survival rates in liver transplant recipients .
Background	However , long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of chronic renal failure , neurotoxicity , de novo malignancies , recurrence of hepatitis C viral ( HCV ) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma .
Background	Several studies have shown that everolimus has the potential to provide protection against viral replication , malignancy , and progression of fibrosis , as well as preventing nephrotoxicity by facilitating calcineurin inhibitor reduction without compromising efficacy .
Background	The Hephaistos study evaluates the beneficial effects of early initiation of everolimus in de novo liver transplant recipients .
Method	Hephaistos is an ongoing @-month , multi-center , open-label , controlled study aiming to enroll @ de novo liver transplant recipients from @ centers across Germany .
Method	Patients are randomized in a @:@ ratio ( @-@days post-transplantation ) to receive everolimus ( trough levels @-@ng / mL ) with reduced tacrolimus ( trough levels < @ng/mL ) , or standard tacrolimus ( trough levels @-@ng / mL ) after entering a run-in period ( @-@days post-transplantation ) .
Method	In the run-in period , patients are treated with induction therapy , mycophenolate mofetil , tacrolimus , and corticosteroids according to local practice .
Method	Randomization is stratified by HCV status and model of end-stage liver disease scores at transplantation .
Method	The primary objective of the study is to exhibit superior renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate assessed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) -@ formula ) with everolimus plus reduced tacrolimus compared to standard tacrolimus at Month @ .
Method	Other objectives are : to assess the incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection , graft loss , or death ; the incidences of components of the composite efficacy endpoint ; renal function via estimated glomerular filtration rate using various formulae ( MDRD-@ , Nankivell , Cockcroft-Gault , chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration and Hoek formulae ) ; the incidence of proteinuria ; the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events ; the incidence and severity of cytomegalovirus and HCV infections and HCV-related fibrosis .
Conclusion	This study aims to demonstrate superior renal function , comparable efficacy , and safety in de novo liver transplant recipients receiving everolimus with reduced tacrolimus compared with standard tacrolimus .
Conclusion	This study also evaluates the antiviral benefit by early initiation of everolimus .

Background	Sociodemographic differences have been observed in the treatment of extremely premature ( periviable ) neonates , but the source of this variation is not well understood .
Background	We assessed the feasibility of using simulation to test the effect of maternal race and insurance status on shared decision making ( SDM ) in periviable counseling .
Method	We conducted a @ @ factorial simulation experiment in which obstetricians and neonatologists counseled @ consecutive standardized patients diagnosed with ruptured membranes at @ weeks , counterbalancing race ( black/white ) and insurance status using random permutation .
Method	We assessed verisimilitude of the simulation in semistructured debriefing interviews .
Method	We coded physician communication related to resuscitation , mode of delivery , and steroid decisions using a @-point SDM coding framework and then compared communication scores by standardized patient race and insurer using analysis of variance .
Result	Sixteen obstetricians and @ neonatologists participated ; @ % were women , @ % were married , and @ % were parents ; @ % of the physicians rated the simulation as highly realistic .
Result	Overall , SDM scores were relatively high , with means ranging from @ to @ ( of @ ) .
Result	There was a statistically significant interaction between race and insurer for SDM related to steroid use and mode of delivery ( P < @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
Result	Between-group comparison revealed nonsignificant differences ( P = < @ ) between the SDM scores for privately insured black patients versus privately insured white patients , Medicaid-insured white patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients , and privately insured black patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients .
Conclusion	This study confirms that simulation is a feasible method for studying sociodemographic effects on periviable counseling .
Conclusion	Shared decision making may occur differentially based on patients ' sociodemographic characteristics and deserves further study .

Background	Although working smoke alarms halve deaths in residential fires , many households do not keep alarms operational .
Background	We tested whether theory-based education increases alarm operability .
Method	Randomised multiarm trial , with a single arm randomly selected for use each day , in low-income neighbourhoods in Maryland , USA .
Method	Intervention arms : ( @ ) Full Education combining a health belief module with a social-cognitive theory module that provided hands-on practice installing alarm batteries and using the alarm 's hush button ; ( @ ) Hands-on Practice social-cognitive module supplemented by typical fire department education ; ( @ ) Current Norm receiving typical fire department education only .
Method	Four hundred and thirty-six homes recruited through churches or by knocking on doors in @-@ .
Method	Follow-up visits checked alarm operability in @ homes ( @ % ) @-@ @ years after installation .
Method	number of homes with working alarms defined as alarms with working batteries or hard-wired and number of working alarms per home .
Method	Regressions controlled for alarm status preintervention ; demographics and beliefs about fire risks and alarm effectiveness .
Result	Homes in the Full Education and Practice arms were more likely to have a functioning smoke alarm at follow-up ( OR = @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) and had an average of @ more working alarms per home ( @ % CI @ to @ ) .
Result	Working alarms per home rose @ % .
Result	Full Education and Practice had similar effectiveness ( p = @ on both outcome measures ) .
Conclusion	Without exceeding typical fire department installation time , installers can achieve greater smoke alarm operability .
Conclusion	Hands-on practice is key .
Conclusion	Two years after installation , for every three homes that received hands-on practice , one had an additional working alarm .

Background	The present study addressed the ecological validity of the individual-focused experimental paradigm in sex research .
Problem	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of partner presence vs. absence in the laboratory testing situation , and of manipulation of attentional focus , on genital and subjective sexual arousal of healthy women and men .
Method	Sexually functional heterosexual men ( n = @ ) and women ( n = @ ) and their partners participated in this study .
Method	During partner presence , the partner sat opposite to the participant ; self-focused attention was experimentally manipulated by introducing , respectively , a semi-reflecting glass pane , and a wall-mounted camera .
Method	Perceived state self-focused attention and genital and subjective sexual arousal during presentation of audiovisual erotic film stimuli were assessed .
Result	Partner presence resulted in higher perceived self-focus ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) and lower genital responses to erotic stimulation ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	The interaction of partner presence and increased self-focused attention differentially affected genital arousal in female and male participants ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	The mean genital response in men was lower during private self-focus than during non-self-focus with the partner present but was higher during private self-focus with the the partner absent ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	The genital response in women to public self-focus was lower than to private self-focus and to non-self-focus with their partner present ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	With the partner absent , the genital response in women to private self-focus was lower than to non-self-focus ( ( p ) ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	Retrospective subjective arousal of women was higher with partner present ( M = @ ) than with partner absent ( M = @ ) , whereas men reported higher retrospective subjective arousal with their partner absent ( M = @ ) than present ( M = @ ) .
Conclusion	These findings suggest that mere presence of the partner impacts the sexual response differentially in women and men .
Conclusion	Enhancing the ecological validity of the individual-based laboratory paradigm for sex research warrants closer examination in future research .

Problem	To investigate the effectiveness of repetitive facilitative exercise ( RFE ) under surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia .
Method	This randomized , controlled , observer-blinded , pilot trial randomized @ adults with severe arm impairment -LSB- Fugl-Meyer Arm scale ( FMA ) @ -RSB- due to stroke of @-@ weeks duration into three groups and provided treatment on a @-week , @ minutes/day , @ days/week schedule .
Method	The RFE-under-NMES group were given @-@ repetitions of standardized movements of shoulder , elbow and wrist joints of their affected arm with concurrent low-amplitude NMES for each corresponding musculature .
Method	The RFE group was given the same exercise regimen but without NMES .
Method	The control group was treated with a conventional arm rehabilitation programme without NMES .
Method	FMA was assessed at baseline and @ weeks .
Result	All @ participants ( nine in each group ) completed the trial .
Result	At @ weeks , the RFE-under-NMES group evidenced significantly greater improvement compared with the control group on the FMA ( p = @ ) , but not with the RFE group ( p = @ ) .
Result	The RFE group showed improvement compared with the control group , but it was not significant ( p = @ ) .
Conclusion	RFE under NMES is feasible in clinical settings and may be more effective than conventional rehabilitation in lessening arm impairment after sub-acute stroke .

Problem	Evidences from cultured cells and animal models of ischemia suggest that lithium has neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and may play a desirable role in reducing infarct volume and even improving the brain insults from stroke .
Problem	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lithium in early motor recovery of patients after ischemic stroke .
Method	Eighty patients with first ever stroke , allocated randomly in lithium , @ mg twice daily , or placebo .
Method	Treatment was initiated @ hours after stroke and continued for @ days .
Method	Modified National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ( mNIHSS ) and hand subsection of Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( hFMA ) were used to evaluate impairment on the fifth and @th day of treatment .
Result	Sixty-six subjects ( @ subjects in the lithium group and @ subjects in the placebo group ) completed the study .
Result	There were no significant differences in the improvement in mNIHSS ( P = @ ) and hFMA ( P = @ ) after @ days .
Result	However , a subgroup analysis showed that patients with cortical strokes in the lithium group had significantly better improvement in both mNIHSS and hFMA in comparison to the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
Result	Approximately @ % ( n = @ ) of patients in the lithium group , mainly from the cortical stroke subgroup , regained more than @ % of full function based on hFMA , whereas this rate in the placebo group was @ % ( n = @ ; P = @ ) .
Conclusion	The observed discrete difference between the lithium group and the placebo group in the cortical stroke subgroup may suggest an enhanced motor recovery after stroke by using an early treatment with a low dose of lithium carbonate .
Conclusion	However , a larger trial with more patients with cortical stroke is needed to investigate this effect better .

Background	Pregnant women are the highest priority group for annual influenza vaccination .
Background	Studies have shown unacceptably low uptake of both seasonal and pandemic A/H@N@ influenza vaccination among pregnant women .
Background	This paper will describe the study protocol and methodology of a randomised controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a brief educational intervention in improving the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine among pregnant women in Hong Kong .
Method	A randomised controlled trial will be conducted with pregnant women in at least the second trimester of pregnancy from four publicly funded hospital antenatal clinics in Hong Kong .
Method	Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of the two treatment groups : standard care ( control ) or standard care plus brief education ( intervention ) .
Method	Pregnant women in the standard care group will receive the usual antenatal care with an educational pamphlet developed by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection and those in the intervention group will be provided with usual care plus a brief ten-minute education intervention .
Method	Content of the education session will cover four core components recommended in the research literature .
Method	The primary study outcome will be the proportion of participants who have received influenza vaccine during their pregnancy .
Method	A total of @ pregnant women ( @ per group ) will be required to give an @ % power to detect a treatment effect of @ % .
Conclusion	Most intervention studies aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates in pregnant women have targeted obstetric-care providers and the results of the two patient-oriented RCT interventions are conflicting .
Conclusion	The high priority for vaccination given to pregnant women and the low influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women worldwide strongly indicates a need for interventions to improve uptake .

Background	Impairments in mismatch negativity ( MMN ) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia .
Background	However , underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail .
Background	Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia .
Method	@ patients with schizophrenia and @ healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN .
Method	Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking ( PL ) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering .
Method	A comprehensive battery ( CANTAB ) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning .
Result	Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia ( @ % CI @ - @ ) .
Result	Patients showed significantly lower EEG power ( @ % CI -@ - -@ ) in the ~ @-@ Hz frequency range ( theta band ) between @ and @ ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB .
Result	However , MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures , medication dose , social functioning or neurocognitive performance .
Conclusion	The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes , it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes .
Conclusion	Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery .

Background	Oral antibiotics use in infants in developing countries is challenging because liquid formulations are often unavailable .
Background	However , dissolving solid formulation of drugs in water poses a risk of gastrointestinal infection .
Background	Although mother 's milk may be a potential vehicle , no evidence exists to indicate that antibiotics dissolved in human milk are bioequivalent to those dissolved in water .
Background	Therefore , we compared pharmacokinetic parameters of an orally administered antibiotic , amoxicillin , dissolved in human milk , to those of water-dissolved amoxicillin .
Method	A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in @ healthy adult volunteers in a randomised crossover design .
Method	Marketed amoxicillin powder for suspension was dissolved in either human milk or water at a final concentration of @ mg/mL , and @ mL was given orally in a fasting state .
Method	Timed blood samples were obtained and plasma amoxicillin was quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry .
Result	Results showed that pharmacokinetic parameters , including area-under-the-curve , Cmax and half-life of the water-based and milk-based amoxicillin administration were not significantly different .
Result	@ % CIs of the ratios of these parameters in concomitant breast milk administration to those of water were within @ % and @ % , suggesting they are bioequivalent ( defined as a range between @ % and @ % ) .
Conclusion	We conclude that oral administration of amoxicillin dissolved in human milk at @ mg/mL results in pharmacokinetics profiles comparable to amoxicillin dissolved in water .
Conclusion	Pharmaceutical interactions between amoxicillin and breast milk are unlikely , suggesting no need to modify dosing schedules .

Problem	Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of pazopanib , a multikinase angiogenesis inhibitor , in a single-arm , open-label , extension study ( VEG@/NCT@ ) for placebo-treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) from a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III study ( VEG@/NCT@ ) .
Method	Patients received pazopanib @ mg/day .
Method	The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of pazopanib treatment .
Method	Secondary endpoints included response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) .
Result	Seventy-nine placebo-treated patients from VEG@/NCT@ who experienced disease progression and one pazopanib-treated patient ( an exemption ) were enrolled .
Result	Forty-one patients ( @ % ) were treatment-naive ; @ ( @ % ) were cytokine-pretreated .
Result	Median exposure to pazopanib was @ months .
Result	All patients had discontinued pazopanib at the time of analysis .
Result	The most common reason for discontinuation was disease progression ( @ % ) .
Result	The most common adverse events were hypertension ( @ % ) , diarrhea ( @ % ) , hair color changes ( @ % ) , anorexia ( @ % ) , and nausea ( @ % ) .
Result	The response rate was @ % -LSB- @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @-@ @ -RSB- ; median PFS was @ months ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) ; median OS was @ months ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
Conclusion	Efficacy and safety profiles for pazopanib in this extension study of patients with RCC previously treated with placebo were very similar to those observed for pazopanib-treated patients in the pivotal phase III study .

Problem	The aim of this study was to compare the combined ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block ( SCB ) and distal median , radial , and ulnar nerve blocks , with the supraclavicular block alone .
Method	Sixty-two patients undergoing upper extremity surgery were randomized to supraclavicular only ( Group S , n = @ ) or supraclavicular + distal ( Group SD , n = @ ) group .
Method	Patients in Group S received @mL of @ % lidocaine + epinephrine @g/mL , while those in Group SD received @mL of @ % lidocaine + epinephrine @g/mL followed by distal median , radial , and ulnar nerve blocks using equal volumes of @ % lidocaine +@ % levobupivacaine ( @mL/nerve ) .
Method	Sensory and motor blocks of the ulnar , median , radial and musculocutaneous nerves were assessed every @min starting at the @th minute .
Method	The imaging , needling and performance times were recorded .
Method	Also , the onset and anesthesia-related times , need for analgesic and first analgesic times , were noted .
Result	In Group SD , the anesthesia onset -LSB- @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) min , p < @ -RSB- and anesthesia related times -LSB- @ ( @-@ @ ) vs. @ ( @-@ @ ) min , p < @ -RSB- were significantly shorter than those of Group S. Additionally , the analgesic requirement was lower in Group SD ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) , while among the patients who required analgesic , the first analgesic time was longer in Group SD in comparison to Group S -LSB- @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) min p < @ -RSB- .
Conclusion	The addition of distal median , radial , and ulnar nerve blocks to SCB shortens anesthesia-related time and anesthesia onset time when compared with a SCB alone .

Problem	Despite their independent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) advantages , effects of - linolenic acid ( ALA ) , monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) , and low-glycemic-load ( GL ) diets have not been assessed in combination .
Problem	We therefore determined the combined effect of ALA , MUFA , and low GL on glycemic control and CVD risk factors in type @ diabetes .
Method	The study was a parallel design , randomized trial wherein each @-month treatment was conducted in a Canadian academic center between March @ and September @ and involved @ participants with type @ diabetes ( HbA@c @ % -@ % -LSB- @-@ mmol/mol -RSB- ) treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents .
Method	Participants were provided with dietary advice on either a low-GL diet with ALA and MUFA given as a canola oil-enriched bread supplement ( @ g canola oil per @,@ kcal ) ( test ) or a whole-grain diet with a whole-wheat bread supplement ( control ) .
Method	The primary outcome was HbA@c change .
Method	Secondary outcomes included calculated Framingham CVD risk score and reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) ratio .
Result	Seventy-nine percent of the test group and @ % of the control group completed the trial .
Result	The test diet reduction in HbA@c units of -@ % ( -@ mmol/mol ) ( @ % CI -@ % to -@ % -LSB- -@ to -@ mmol/mol -RSB- ) was greater than that for the control diet ( -@ % -LSB- -@ mmol/mol -RSB- -LSB- @ % CI -@ % to -@ % ( -@ to -@ mmol/mol ) -RSB- , P = @ ) , with the greatest benefit observed in those with higher systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) .
Result	Greater reductions were seen in CVD risk score for the test diet , whereas the RHI ratio increased for the control diet .
Conclusion	A canola oil-enriched low-GL diet improved glycemic control in type @ diabetes , particularly in participants with raised SBP , whereas whole grains improved vascular reactivity .

Problem	Patients @ years old ( `` older '' ) are often not included in randomized clinical trials ( RCT ) , but when they are , care in an RCT might improve quality of life ( QoL ) .
Problem	We conducted a prospective comparison of QoL among older women receiving standard chemotherapy from the same cooperative group physicians in an RCT vs. an observational study ( `` off-trial '' ) .
Method	Older women with invasive , non-metastatic breast cancer ( n = @ RCT ; @ off-trial ) were included .
Method	Linear mixed-effects models tested associations between chemotherapy on - vs. off-trial and changes in EORTC ( European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire ) QoL scores over @ months , controlling for pre-treatment QoL , age , education , tumor factors , comorbidity , and other covariates .
Result	Anthracycline regimens were used by @ % of women treated on-trial vs. @ % of those treated off-trial .
Result	Women in the RCT reported an adjusted mean increase of @ points ( @ % CI @ , @ ) in global QoL at @ months ( vs. mid-treatment ) , while women treated off-trial had only an adjusted improvement of @ points ( @ % CI @ , @ ; p = @ for difference in mean changes ) .
Result	Women in the RCT had significantly greater improvement in emotional function than those treated off-trial , controlling for baseline ; they also had greater reductions in therapy side effects and fatigue at @ months than women off-trial , controlling for covariates .
Conclusion	There may be different QoL trajectories for older women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy on - vs. off-trial .
Conclusion	If confirmed , the results suggest that the extra monitoring and communication within an RCT could provide the infrastructure for interventions to address symptoms and improve QoL for the growing older cancer population .

Background	Ticagrelor has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with ACS .
Background	However , the effects of this drug on parameters of microvascular flow in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) have not been completely evaluated .
Method	Ninety-two patients presenting with STEMI where randomized to a loading dose of clopidogrel ( @ mg ) or ticagrelor ( @ mg ) before undergoing primary angioplasty .
Method	We assessed angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters of myocardial reperfusion .
Method	Blinded operators calculated angiographic corrected TIMI Frame count ( cTFC ) and myocardial blush grade ( MBG ) before and after stent implantation .
Method	ST segment resolution was also measured in all patients .
Method	Primary endpoint was cTFC after PCI .
Method	Secondary endpoints were cTFC prior to PCI , TIMI flow grade , MBG and the percentage of ST resolution .
Result	Of the @ randomized patients , @ patients were analyzed .
Result	Mean age of patients was @ years .
Result	Patients presented with a mean ischemic time of @ hours .
Result	There were no significant differences in the time between loading dose and stent deployment ( @ in ticagrelor and @ min in clopidogrel , p = @ ) .
Result	cTFC before angioplasty was significantly lower in ticagrelor than in clopidogrel ( @ vs. @ frames respectively , p = @ ) .
Result	After angioplasty there were no differences between ticagrelor and clopidogrel in cTFC ( @ vs. @ frames respectively , p = @ ) ; MBG grade @ was present in @ vs. @ % of patients , respectively ( p = @ ) .
Result	The percentage of ST resolution did not show any differences between groups ( @ in ticagrelor vs. @ in clopidogrel , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	Compared with clopidogrel , ticagrelor loading in patients presenting with STEMI is not associated with an improvement of angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters of myocardial reperfusion after angioplasty .

Problem	The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial was completed with a low stroke and death rate .
Problem	A lead-in series of patients receiving carotid artery stenting was used to select the physician-operators for the study , where performance was evaluated by complication rates and by peer review of cases .
Problem	Herein , we assess the potential contribution of statistical evaluation of complication rates .
Method	The ability to discriminate between stent operators who can successfully meet the published guideline of < @ % combined rate of stroke and death is calculated under the binomial distribution , based on a small consecutive case series ( n = @ patients ) .
Result	A criterion of @ stroke or death events among the @ patients ( < @ % event rate ) was required of operators .
Result	Setting such a high criterion , however , ensures an inability to exclude operators who can not meet the criteria .
Result	In fact , if a good operator is defined as having a @ % event rate and a poor operator as a @ % event rate , even a series of @ patients would ( on average ) still exclude @ % of the good operators and include @ % of the poor operators .
Conclusion	The low periprocedural event rates in the trial suggest success in separating skillful operators from less skillful .
Conclusion	However , it seems unlikely that statistical assessment of event rates in the lead-in contributed to successful selection , but rather successful selection was more likely because of peer review of subjective and other factors including patient volume and technical approaches .

Problem	To describe quantitative and qualitative features of eyes with advanced bullous keratopathy assessed using ultrasound biomicroscopy , before and after anterior stromal puncture ( ASP ) or amniotic membrane transplantation ( AMT ) procedures to relieve chronic pain .
Method	The present descriptive comparative study included @ eyes of @ patients with chronic intermittent pain due to bullous keratopathy who were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments ( AMT or ASP ) .
Method	Ultrasound biomicroscopy ( Humphrey , UBM @ , @ MHz transducer , immersion technique ) was used , and a questionnaire about pain intensity was completed preoperatively and postoperatively at days @ and @ , respectively .
Method	Exclusion criteria were age < @ years , presence of concurrent infection , ocular hypertension , and absence of pain .
Result	In a @-day follow-up , the AMT group exhibited mean central corneal thickness ( CCT ) , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p < @ ) ; mean epithelial thickness ( ET ) , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p < @ ) ; and mean stromal thickness ( ST ) , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p = @ ) .
Result	The ASP group exhibited mean CCT , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p < @ ) ; mean ET , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p < @ ) ; and mean ST , @ m preoperatively and @ m postoperatively ( p < @ ) .
Result	Correlations between CCT and pain intensity in the AMT group ( p = @ pre - and postoperatively ) and the ASP group ( p = @ preoperatively and p = @ at the @-day follow-up ) were not statistically significant .
Result	Epithelial and stromal edema , Descemet 's membrane folds , epithelial bullae , and the presence of interface fluid were frequently observed qualitative features .
Conclusion	CCT increased over time in both groups .
Conclusion	The magnitude of CCT did not correlate with pain intensity in the sample studied .
Conclusion	The presence of interface fluid was a qualitative feature specifically found in some patients who underwent AMT .

Background	Randomized trials have not shown major survival benefits when induction chemotherapy plus standard therapy is compared with standard therapy alone in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .
Background	Induction chemotherapy is likely to be effective for biologically distinct subgroups and biomarker development may lead to identification of patients whose tumors are likely to respond to a particular treatment .
Method	We evaluated immunohistochemical staining for GDF@ in pretreatment biopsy specimens of @ of @ OSCC patients who were treated in a prospective , randomized , phase III trial on induction chemotherapy including docetaxel , cisplatin and @-fluorouracil ( TPF ) .
Method	Relationship between GDF@ intervention and cell proliferation , migration , invasion , colony formation and tumorigenicity was analyzed using in vitro and in vivo OSCC models .
Result	Low GDF@ expression predicted a better survival in OSCC patients , especially overall survival -LSB- P = @ , hazard ratio ( HR ) = @ -RSB- and distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS ; P = @ , HR = @ ) .
Result	cN + patients with low GDF@ expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival ( P = @ , HR = @ ) and DMFS ( P = @ , HR = @ ) , cN - patients with high GDF@ expression benefitted from induction TPF in overall survival ( P = @ , HR = @ ) , disease-free survival ( P = @ , HR = @ ) , locoregional recurrence-free survival ( P = @ , HR = @ ) and DMFS ( P = @ , HR = @ ) .
Result	Decreased GDF@ expression in OSCC lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation , migration , invasion , colony formation and tumorigenesis through increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK@/@ ( P < @ ) .
Result	Likewise , overexpression of GDF@ significantly promoted cell proliferation , migration , invasion and colony formation through decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK@/@ ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	GDF@ expression can be used as a prognostic biomarker for OSCC , and as a predictive biomarker for benefitting from TPF induction chemotherapy .
Conclusion	GDF@ promotes tumorigenesis and progression through phosphorylation of AKT and ERK@/@ in OSCC .
Conclusion	The clinical trial in this study was registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT@ ) .

Problem	To test whether red blood cell ( RBC ) levels of marine omega-@ fatty acids measured in the Women 's Health Initiative Memory Study were related to MRI brain volumes measured @ years later .
Method	RBC eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , and MRI brain volumes were assessed in @,@ postmenopausal women from the Women 's Health Initiative Memory Study .
Method	The endpoints were total brain volume and anatomical regions .
Method	Linear mixed models included multiple imputations of fatty acids and were adjusted for hormone therapy , time since randomization , demographics , intracranial volume , and cardiovascular disease risk factors .
Result	In fully adjusted models , a @ SD greater RBC EPA + DHA ( omega-@ index ) level was correlated with @ cm ( @ ) larger brain volume ( p = @ ) .
Result	DHA was marginally correlated ( p = @ ) with total brain volume while EPA was less so ( p = @ ) .
Result	There were no correlations between ischemic lesion volumes and EPA , DHA , or EPA + DHA .
Result	A @ SD greater omega-@ index was correlated with greater hippocampal volume ( @ mm ( @ ) , p = @ ) in fully adjusted models .
Result	Comparing the fourth quartile vs the first quartile of the omega-@ index confirmed greater hippocampal volume ( @ mm ( @ ) , p = @ ) .
Conclusion	A higher omega-@ index was correlated with larger total normal brain volume and hippocampal volume in postmenopausal women measured @ years later .
Conclusion	While normal aging results in overall brain atrophy , lower omega-@ index may signal increased risk of hippocampal atrophy .
Conclusion	Future studies should examine whether maintaining higher RBC EPA + DHA levels slows the rate of hippocampal or overall brain atrophy .

Background	With aging , the detrimental effects of stress can impair a person 's ability to learn and sustain memory .
Background	Humor and its associated mirthful laughter can reduce stress by decreasing the hormone cortisol .
Background	Chronic release of cortisol can damage hippocampal neurons , leading to impairment of learning and memory .
Background	Objectives The study intended to examine the effect of watching a humor video on short-term memory in older adults .
Background	Design The research team designed a randomized , controlled trial .
Method	The study took place at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda , CA , USA .
Method	The study included @ participants : @ normal , healthy , older adults-@ males and @ females-and @ older adults with type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) -@ males and @ females .
Method	The study included @ intervention groups of older adults who viewed humorous videos , a healthy group ( humor group ) , aged @ @ y , and the diabetic group , aged @ @ y. Each participant selected @ of @ humorous videos that were @ min in length , either a Red Skeleton comedy or a montage of America 's Funniest Home Videos .
Method	The control group , aged @ @ y , did not watch a humor video and sat in quiescence .
Method	A standardized , neuropsychological , memory-assessment tool , the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) , was used to assess the following abilities : ( @ ) learning , ( @ ) recall , and ( @ ) visual recognition .
Method	The testing occurred twice , once before ( RAVLT@ ) and once after ( RAVLT@ ) the humorous video for the humor and diabetic groups , and once before ( RAVLT@ ) and once after ( RAVLT@ ) the period of quiescence for the control group .
Method	At @ time points , measurements of salivary cortisol were also obtained .
Method	The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to measure significance of the data based on the @ groups .
Result	In the humor , diabetic , and control groups , ( @ ) learning ability improved by @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively ( P = @ ) ; ( @ ) delayed recall improved by @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively ( P = @ ) ; and ( @ ) visual recognition increased by @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively ( P = @ ) .
Result	For levels of salivary cortisol , the research team found significant and borderline decreases for the humor group between baseline and ( @ ) post-RAVLT@ ( P = @ ) , ( @ ) postvideo ( P = @ ) , and ( @ ) post-RAVLT@ ( P = @ ) .
Result	The diabetic group showed significant decreases between baseline and ( @ ) post-RAVLT@ ( P = @ ) , ( @ ) postvideo ( P = @ ) , and ( @ ) post-RAVLT@ ( P = @ ) .
Result	The study found no significant changes for the control group .
Conclusion	The research findings supported potential clinical and rehabilitative benefits for humor that can be applied to whole-person wellness programs for older adults .
Conclusion	The cognitive components-learning ability and delayed recall-become more challenging as individuals age and are essential to older adults for providing a high quality of life : mind , body , and spirit .
Conclusion	Because older adults can experience age-related memory deficits , complementary , enjoyable , and beneficial humor therapies should be implemented for them .

Background	Premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment .
Background	Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group .
Method	This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief , mindfulness-based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress , depression , and inflammatory activity .
Method	Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age @ who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a @-week Mindful Awareness Practices ( MAPS ) intervention group ( n = @ ) or to a wait-list control group ( n = @ ) .
Method	Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms ( primary outcomes ) as well as physical symptoms , cancer-related distress , and positive outcomes .
Method	Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation .
Method	Participants also completed questionnaires at a @-month follow-up assessment .
Result	In linear mixed models , the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress ( P = @ ) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms ( P = @ ) , as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression ( P = @ ) and inflammatory signaling ( P = @ ) at postintervention .
Result	Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue , sleep disturbance , and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect ( P < @ for all ) .
Result	Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the @-month follow-up assessment , although reductions in cancer-related distress were observed at that assessment .
Conclusion	A brief , mindfulness-based intervention demonstrated preliminary short-term efficacy in reducing stress , behavioral symptoms , and proinflammatory signaling in younger breast cancer survivors .

Problem	The purpose of this study was to evaluate a traditional herbal preparation , Jobelyn , for its effects on anemia and CD@ + T-cell counts in human immunodeficiency virus-positive ( HIV + ) patients in Nigeria .
Method	An open-label pilot study involving @ confirmed ( HIV + ) patients who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy ( ARVT ) was performed , in which the patients consumed Jobelyn for @ weeks , at a dose of @mg twice daily .
Method	The pilot study was followed by a controlled trial involving @ patients , all confirmed HIV + , where the patients with CD@ + T-cell counts below @ cells/L were receiving ARVT .
Method	The eight patients with baseline CD@ + T-cell counts above @ cells/L received Jobelyn .
Method	The remaining patients who all received ARVT were randomized to ARVT alone versus ARVT+J obelyn for @ weeks .
Result	Patients receiving ARVT showed a statistically significant improvement in their CD@ + T-cell counts across the @-week study period ( p < @ ) .
Result	Patients receiving ARVT+J obelyn showed a faster improvement , reaching a high level of statistical significance compared to baseline already at @ weeks ( p < @ ) , and remained highly significant at @ weeks ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	This is the first controlled study conducted to evaluate efficacy of Jobelyn on immune status in HIV + patients .
Conclusion	The data suggest that consumption of Jobelyn contributed to improved hemoglobin levels and increased CD@ + T-cell counts in Nigerian HIV + patients .
Conclusion	Further studies are needed to examine similar effects in other populations , and to elaborate on the underlying mechanisms , specifically , whether the consumption of Jobelyn supported multiple aspects of bone marrow function .

Problem	We hypothesized that a targeted temperature of @ C as compared to that of @ C would increase survival and reduce the severity of circulatory shock in patients with shock on admission after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) .
Method	The recently published Target Temperature Management trial ( TTM-trial ) randomized @ OHCA patients with no difference in outcome between groups and no difference in mortality at the end of the trial in a predefined subgroup of patients with shock at admission .
Method	Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of < @ mm Hg for > @ min or the need of supportive measures to maintain a blood pressure @ mmHg and/or clinical signs of end-organ hypoperfusion .
Method	In this post hoc analysis reported here , we further analyzed the @ patients with shock at admission ; all had been randomized to receive intervention at @ C ( TTM@ ; n = @ ) or @ C ( TTM@ ; n = @ ) .
Method	Primary outcome was @-day mortality .
Method	Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit ( ICU ) and @-day mortality , severity of circulatory shock assessed by mean arterial pressure , serum lactate , fluid balance and the extended Sequential Organ Failure assessment ( SOFA ) score .
Result	There was no significance difference between targeted temperature management at @ C or @ C on @-day mortality -LSB- log-rank test , p = @ , hazard ratio @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ -RSB- or ICU mortality ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ; relative risk @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
Result	Serum lactate and the extended cardiovascular SOFA score were higher in the TTM@ group ( p < @ ) .
Conclusion	We found no benefit in survival or severity of circulatory shock with targeted temperature management at @ C as compared to @ C in patients with shock on admission after OHCA .

Problem	Retrospective subgroup analysis in JMDB study indicates that the between-arm differences in overall survival ( OS ) in the East Asian subgroup were consistent with those observed in the entire JMDB study population .
Problem	This bridging study ( JMIL ) further evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line pemetrexed/cisplatin ( PC ) versus gemcitabine/cisplatin ( GC ) in Chinese patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
Problem	The primary endpoint of this local registration trial was designed to compare OS in the combined dataset , consisting of Chinese patients in JMIL and @ nonsquamous patients in JMDB .
Method	Chinese patients with stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to @ cycles maximum ( @ days/cycle ) of pemetrexed @mg/m ( @ ) + cisplatin @mg/m ( @ ) ( day @ ) , or gemcitabine @mg/m ( @ ) ( days @ and @ ) + cisplatin @mg/m ( @ ) ( day @ ) .
Result	In JMIL , @ Chinese patients were randomized ( PC , n = @ ; GC , n = @ ) .
Result	Patient baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms .
Result	In the combined dataset , PC was superior to GC in prolonging OS , with adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) of @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) and median OS of @ versus @ months .
Result	In the JMIL-only population , no significant OS difference observed between treatment arms ( adjusted HR = @ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ -RSB- ; unadjusted HR = @ -LSB- @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ -RSB- ) , nor for other secondary efficacy endpoints .
Result	Significantly fewer patients in the PC arm experienced drug-related grade @/@ toxicities , @ ( @ % ) versus @ ( @ % ) for GC ( p = @ ) , with significantly lower rates of leukocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , and fatigue .
Conclusion	This study showed that in the combined population , OS of PC was superior to GC , while in the Chinese-only population , no significant difference was observed ; a better safety and risk/benefit profile was found in the PC arm .
Conclusion	A PC regimen should be considered as a standard of care in Chinese nonsquamous NSCLC patients in a first-line setting .

Problem	Aggressive behaviour in psychosis is not uncommon .
Problem	Community provision for people with psychosis has left informal caregivers to take on a greater role in their care .
Problem	However , few studies have explored links between patient-initiated violence in mental health caregiving relationships and caregiver functioning .
Problem	Our study investigated caregiver reports of aggressive acts committed by their relative with psychosis and their links to caregiver appraisals of the caregiving relationship and caregiver outcomes .
Method	Caregivers of patients with a recent relapse of psychosis , recruited to a psychological therapy trial , completed the audiotaped Camberwell Family Interview at baseline .
Method	This semi-structured interview includes questions on the quality of the relationship between caregiver and patient , and patient history of violence .
Method	Seventy-two transcripts of interviews were assessed for reports of patient-initiated violence .
Result	One-half of the caregiver sample ( @ % ) reported an incident of patient-initiated violence during their interview ; @ % of these involved violence toward themselves , and @ % toward property .
Result	Reports of patient violence were associated with caregiver ratings of hostility expressed toward patients , lower self-esteem , and emotion-focused coping .
Result	People caring on their own were more likely to report incidents of patient violence .
Result	Younger patients , males , and inpatients were more frequently identified as having a history of this kind of violence .
Conclusion	Our findings suggested that caregiver reports of patient-initiated violence in psychosis are not uncommon .
Conclusion	Mental health staff need to be aware of the risks of such violence for caregivers of people with psychosis , and consider appropriate procedures for minimizing it .

Background	The impact of dairy intake on cardiometabolic risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) needs further research .
Problem	To investigate the impact of milk consumption on a wide array of cardiometabolic risk factors associated with MetS ( blood lipids , cholesterol homeostasis , glucose homeostasis , systemic inflammation , blood pressure , endothelial function ) in postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity .
Method	In this randomized , crossover study , @ women with abdominal obesity consumed two @-week diets based on the National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) , one with @ servings/d of @ % fat milk per @kcal ( MILK ) and one without milk or other dairy ( NCEP ) .
Method	The macronutrient composition of both diets was comparable ( @ % carbohydrates , @ % proteins , @ % fat and @ % saturated fat ) .
Result	The MILK diet had no significant effect on LDL-C , triglycerides , LDL size , CRP and cell adhesion molecule concentrations and on indicators of insulin sensitivity .
Result	The MILK diet reduced HDL-C , adiponectin , endothelin and fasting glucose levels as well blood pressure ( all P@ @ ) , but those changes were comparable to those seen with the NCEP milk-free diet ( all between-diet P@ @ ) .
Result	Finally , the MILK diet was associated with lower VLDL apolipoprotein B fractional catabolic rate ( -@ % ; P = @ ) and plasma sterol concentrations ( -@ % ; P = @ ) compared with the control NCEP milk-free diet .
Conclusion	These data suggest that short-term consumption of low fat milk in the context of a prudent NCEP diet has no favorable nor deleterious effect on cardiometabolic risk factors associated with MetS in postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity .

Problem	We previously demonstrated that @ % of patients with pain at sites of previously irradiated bone metastases benefit from reirradiation .
Problem	It is unknown whether alleviating pain also improves patient perception of quality of life ( QOL ) .
Method	We used the database of a randomized trial comparing radiation treatment dose fractionation schedules to evaluate whether response , determined using the International Consensus Endpoint ( ICE ) and Brief Pain Inventory pain score ( BPI-PS ) , is associated with patient perception of benefit , as measured using the European Organisation for Resesarch and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core @ ( QLQ-C@ ) and functional interference scale of the BPI ( BPI-FI ) .
Method	Evaluable patients completed baseline and @-month follow-up assessments .
Result	Among @ randomly assigned patients , @ were evaluable for response using the ICE and @ using the BPI-PS .
Result	Using the ICE , @ patients experienced a response and @ did not .
Result	Responding patients had superior scores on all items of the BPI-FI ( ie , general activity , mood , walking ability , normal work , relations with other people , sleep , and enjoyment of life ) and improved QOL , as determined by scores on the EORTC QLQ-C@ scales of physical , role , emotional and social functioning , global QOL , fatigue , pain , and appetite .
Result	Similar results were obtained using the BPI-PS ; observed improvements were typically of lesser magnitude .
Conclusion	Patients responding to reirradiation of painful bone metastases experience superior QOL scores and less functional interference associated with pain .
Conclusion	Patients should be offered re-treatment for painful bone metastases in the hope of reducing pain severity as well as improving QOL and pain interference .

Background	Our objective was to determine the interrelationships of interleukin ( IL ) -@ receptor inhibition with haemoglobin , acute-phase reactants and iron metabolism markers ( including hepcidin ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
Method	Data of patients receiving tocilizumab or placebo in the MEASURE study were analysed .
Method	We investigated associations at baseline and during tocilizumab treatment among haemoglobin , parameters of haemoglobin and iron homeostasis -LSB- ferritin , total iron-binding capacity ( TIBC ) , hepcidin , haptoglobin -RSB- , IL-@ and acute-phase reactants -LSB- C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) -RSB- to identify statistical correlates of rise in haemoglobin level .
Result	At baseline , CRP and haptoglobin were inversely correlated ( modestly ) with haemoglobin levels .
Result	After treatment with tocilizumab , CRP , hepcidin , ferritin and haptoglobin levels fell alongside increases in TIBC and haemoglobin .
Result	The falls in CRP , hepcidin and haptoglobin levels in the first @ weeks correlated with a week @ rise in TIBC and haemoglobin .
Conclusion	Inflammatory anaemia improves in patients with RA treated with tocilizumab .
Conclusion	This improvement correlates with the degree of suppression of systemic inflammation , reduction in hepcidin and haptoglobin and increase in iron-binding capacity .
Conclusion	These clinical data provide evidence of a role for IL-@ signalling in the inflammatory anaemia of RA .

Background	Selective neck dissection ( SND ) in clinical N@ ( cN@ ) cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) has been performed by surgeons using a retroauricular or modified facelift approach with robotic or endoscopic assistance .
Background	However , these procedures provide cosmetic satisfaction at the cost of possible maximal invasiveness .
Background	In this prospective study , we introduced and evaluated the feasibility as well as surgical invasiveness and cosmetic outcome of endoscopically-assisted SND via a small submandibular approach .
Method	Forty-four patients with cT@-@N@ oral SCC ( OSCC ) were randomly divided into two groups of endoscopically-assisted SND and conventional SND .
Method	Perioperative and postoperative outcomes of patients were evaluated , including the length of the incision , operating time for neck dissection , estimated blood loss during the operation , amount and duration of drainage , total hospitalization period , total number of lymph nodes retrieved , satisfaction scores based on the cosmetic results , perioperative local complications , shoulder syndrome , and follow-up information .
Result	The mean operation time in the endoscopically-assisted group ( @ min ) was longer than that in the conventional group ( @ min ) .
Result	However , the mean length of the incision was @ cm in the endoscopically-assisted SND group , and the amount and duration of drainage , total hospital stay , postoperative shoulder pain score , and cosmetic outcomes were superior in the endoscopically-assisted SND group .
Result	Additionally , the retrieved lymph nodes and complications were comparable .
Conclusion	Endoscopically-assisted SND via a small submandibular approach had a longer operation time than the conventional approach .
Conclusion	However , endoscopically-assisted SND was feasible and reliable while providing minimal invasiveness and satisfactory appearance .

Problem	The cost implications of the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention ( ORIGIN ) trial were evaluated using a prespecified analysis plan .
Method	Purchasing power parity-adjusted country-specific costs were applied to consumed healthcare resources by participants from each country .
Method	Subgroup analyses were conducted on subgroups based on baseline metabolic status and diabetes duration .
Result	The total undiscounted cost per participant in the insulin glargine arm was $ @,@ ( $ @,@ to $ @,@ ) versus $ @,@ ( $ @,@ to $ @,@ ) for standard care , an increase of $ @ ( $ @ to $ @ ; p < @ ) ; the discounted increase was $ @ ( $ @ to $ @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	The greater number of mainly generic oral anti-diabetic agents in the standard group partially offset the higher cost of basal insulin glargine .
Result	As the trial progressed and the standard group required more anti-diabetic medications , the annual cost difference decreased , reaching $ @ ( - $ @ to $ @ ) in the last year .
Result	The subgroup whose baseline diabetes duration was @ years achieved cost-savings during the trial .
Conclusion	From a global perspective basal insulin glargine use in ORIGIN incurred greater costs than standard care using older generic drugs .
Conclusion	Nevertheless , the cost difference fell with time such that the intervention was cost-neutral by the last year .

Background	Total weight loss induced by energy restriction is highly variable even under tightly controlled conditions .
Background	Identifying weight-loss discriminants would provide a valuable weight management tool and insights into body weight regulation .
Problem	This study characterized responsiveness to energy restriction in adults from variables including the plasma metabolome , endocrine and inflammatory markers , clinical indices , body composition , diet , and physical activity .
Method	Data were derived from a controlled feeding trial investigating the effect of @-@ dairy product servings in an energy-restricted diet ( @ kJ/d reduction ) over @ wk .
Method	Partial least squares regression was used to identify weight-loss discriminants in @ overweight and obese adults .
Method	Linear mixed models were developed to identify discriminant variable differences in high - vs. low-weight-loss responders .
Result	Both pre - and postintervention variables ( n = @ ) were identified as weight-loss discriminants ( root mean squared error of prediction = @ kg ; Q ( @ ) = @ ) .
Result	Compared with low-responders ( LR ) , high-responders ( HR ) had greater decreases in body weight ( LR : @ @ kg ; HR : @ @ kg , P < @ ) , BMI ( in kg/m ( @ ) ; LR : @ @ ; HR : @ @ , P < @ ) , and total fat ( LR : @ @ kg ; HR : @ @ kg , P < @ ) .
Result	Significant group effects unaffected by the intervention were determined for the respiratory exchange ratio ( LR : @ @ ; HR : @ @ , P < @ ) , moderate physical activity ( LR : @ @ min ; HR : @ @ min , P = @ ) , sedentary activity ( LR : @ @ min ; HR : @ @ min , P = @ ) , and plasma stearate -LSB- LR : @,@ @,@ quantifier ion peak height ( QIPH ) ; HR : @,@ @,@ QIPH , P = @ -RSB- .
Conclusion	Overweight and obese individuals highly responsive to energy restriction had accelerated reductions in adiposity , likely supported in part by higher lipid mobilization and combustion .
Conclusion	A novel observation was that person-to-person differences in habitual physical activity and magnitude of weight loss were accompanied by unique blood metabolite signatures .
Conclusion	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

Result	Fifty participants were allocated to each arm .
Result	The mean ( SD ) CD@ + T cell count at baseline was @ ( @ ) cells/mm ( @ ) and HIV-@ RNA had been < @ copies/mL for a median ( IQR ) of @ ( @-@ @ ) weeks before enrolment .
Result	At week @ no treatment failure had occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) DRV@ patients and in @/@ ( @ % ) DRV@ patients ( difference -@ % ; @ % CI lower limit , -@ % ) .
Result	When only patients with virological data were considered , that endpoint was met by @/@ ( @ % ) in the DRV@ arm and @/@ ( @ % ) in the DRV@ arm ( difference -@ % ; @ % CI lower limit , -@ % ) .
Result	Darunavir exposure was similar in the two arms .
Result	The average reduction in annual cost per successfully treated DRV@-arm patient was US$ @ .
Conclusion	The efficacy of a darunavir daily dose of @ mg seemed to be similar to the efficacy of the standard @ mg dose in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients on triple ART .
Conclusion	This strategy can potentially translate to substantial savings in the cost of care of HIV-infected patients .

Background	Nonvariceal acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( AUGIB ) is often accompanied by post-discharge anaemia .
Problem	To investigate whether iron treatment can effectively treat anaemia and to compare a @-month regimen of oral iron treatment with a single administration of intravenous iron prior to discharge .
Method	Ninety-seven patients with nonvariceal AUGIB and anaemia were enrolled in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised study .
Method	The patients were allocated to one of three groups , receiving a single intravenous administration of @ mg of iron ; oral iron treatment , @ mg daily for @ months ; or placebo , respectively .
Method	The patients were followed up for @ months .
Result	From week @ onwards , patients receiving treatment had significantly higher haemoglobin levels compared with patients who received placebo only .
Result	At the end of treatment , the proportion of patients with anaemia was significantly higher in the placebo group ( P < @ ) than in the treatment groups .
Result	Intravenous iron appeared to be more effective than oral iron in ensuring sufficient iron stores .
Conclusion	Iron treatment is effective and essential for treating anaemia after nonvariceal acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Conclusion	The route of iron supplementation is less important in terms of the increase in haemoglobin levels .
Conclusion	Iron stores are filled most effectively if intravenous iron supplementation is administered ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT@ ) .

Background	It is unclear if holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI ) or angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB ) prior to coronary angiography reduces contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .
Background	We undertook a randomized trial to investigate the effect of holding ACEI/ARB therapy prior to coronary angiography on the incidence of AKI .
Method	We randomly assigned @ patients with moderate renal insufficiency ( creatinine @ mg/dL within @ months and/or documented creatinine @ mg/dL within @ week before cardiac catheterization ) to hold ACEI/ARB @ hours preprocedure or continue ACEI/ARB .
Method	The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI defined as an absolute rise in serum creatinine of @ mg/dL from baseline and/or a relative rise in serum creatinine of @ % compared with baseline measured at @ to @ hours postcardiac catheterization .
Result	All patients were taking an ACEI ( @ % ) or ARB ( @ % ) prior to randomization .
Result	At @ to @ hours , the primary outcome occurred in @ % of patients who continued ACEI/ARB compared with @ % of the patients who held ACEI/ARB ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Result	In a prespecified secondary outcome , there was a lower rise in mean serum creatinine after the procedure in patients who held ACEI/ARB ( @ @ vs @ @ mg/dL , P = @ ) .
Result	The clinical composite of death , myocardial infarction , ischemic stroke , congestive heart failure , rehospitalization for cardiovascular cause , or need for dialysis preprocedure occurred in @ % who continued ACEI/ARB compared with @ % who held the ACEI/ARB ( hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
Conclusion	In this pilot study of patients with moderate renal insufficiency undergoing cardiac catheterization , with-holding ACEI/ARB resulted in a non-significant reduction in contrast-induced AKI and a significant reduction in post-procedural rise of creatinine .
Conclusion	This low cost intervention could be considered when referring a patient for cardiac catheterization .

Result	In the selective-time - acupuncture group , the total score of fatigue , the s core of physical fatigue and the score of mental fatigue after treatment were reduced obviously as compared with those hefore treatment ( all P < @ ) .
Result	The improvements in the scores of the selective-time-acupuncture group were superior to the acupuncture group ( all P < @ ) .
Result	The ratio of CD@ + and CD@ + T cells was increased obviously after treatment in the two groups ( all P < @ ) and the ratio of CD@ + and CD@ + T cells was reduced obviously in the selective-time-acupuncture group ( P < @ ) , which was better than that in the acupuncture group ( all P < @ ) .
Result	The total effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the selective-time-acupuncture group , which was better than @ % ( @/@ ) in the acupuncture group ( P < @ ) .
Conclusion	The acupuncture therapy at selective time is effective in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome of qi deficiency syndrome , which is especially better at relieving mental fatigue .
Conclusion	The effect of this therapy is achieved probably by improving the immune function via the regulation of the ratios among CD@ + , CD@ + and CD@ + T cells .

Background	During lower limb lengthening , distraction-induced muscle pain and surrounding joint contractures are frustrating complications for which few effective treatments are available .
Problem	We evaluated Botulinum Toxin Type A ( BtX-A ) injection in the calf muscles during human tibial distraction osteogenesis .
Problem	We hypothesized that it may decrease calf pain and increase ROM of the surrounding joints by reducing muscle stiffness .
Method	Between April @ and January @ , we evaluated @ patients undergoing bilateral tibia lengthening who met prespecified inclusion criteria .
Method	All patients underwent stature lengthening with lengthening over a nail or lengthening and then nailing .
Method	BtX-A ( @IU ) was injected at the calf muscle only in one leg for each patient and the same amount of sterile normal saline was injected into the other leg as a control .
Method	Selection of the leg receiving the toxin was randomized .
Method	Clinical evaluation included a VAS score for calf pain and measurement of ROM of the knees and ankles and calf circumference , with evaluations performed in a double-blinded manner .
Method	Side-to-side differences were analyzed until the end of consolidation phase .
Method	Minimum followup was @months ( mean , @months ; range , @-@months ) .
Method	The distraction rate and the final length gain were similar in the treated and control limbs .
Method	A priori power analysis suggested that @ legs were required to achieve statistical significance of @ with @ % of power to detect a @ % difference in treatment effect between treatment and control groups .
Result	There were no differences in calf pain , knee and ankle ROM , and maximal calf circumferences between the two legs at each time point .
Conclusion	Local injection of @IU BtX-A at the human calf muscle does not appear to reduce calf pain or help enhance ROM of the knee and ankle during tibial lengthening .
Conclusion	However , the small sample size provided sufficient power to detect only relatively large clinical effects ; future , larger trials will be needed to determine whether smaller differences are present .
Method	Level II , therapeutic study .

Background	Organ dysfunction consequent to infection ( ` severe sepsis ' ) is the leading cause of admission to an intensive care unit ( ICU ) .
Background	In both animal models and early clinical studies the calcium channel sensitizer levosimendan has been demonstrated to have potentially beneficial effects on organ function .
Background	The aims of the Levosimendan for the Prevention of Acute oRgan Dysfunction in Sepsis ( LeoPARDS ) trial are to identify whether a @-hour infusion of levosimendan will improve organ dysfunction in adults who have septic shock and to establish the safety profile of levosimendan in this group of patients .
Method	This is a multicenter , randomized , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial .
Method	Adults fulfilling the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection , and requiring vasopressor therapy , will be eligible for inclusion in the trial .
Method	Within @ hours of meeting these inclusion criteria , patients will be randomized in a @:@ ratio stratified by the ICU to receive either levosimendan ( @ to @ g.kg.min or placebo for @ hours in addition to standard care .
Method	The primary outcome measure is the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score while in the ICU .
Method	Secondary outcomes include : central venous oxygen saturations and cardiac output ; incidence and severity of renal failure using the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria ; duration of renal replacement therapy ; serum bilirubin ; time to liberation from mechanical ventilation ; @-day , hospital , @ and @ month survival ; ICU and hospital length-of-stay ; and days free from catecholamine therapy .
Method	Blood and urine samples will be collected on the day of inclusion , at @ hours , and on days @ and @ post-inclusion for investigation of the mechanisms by which levosimendan might improve organ function .
Method	Eighty patients will have additional blood samples taken to measure levels of levosimendan and its active metabolites OR-@ and OR-@ .
Method	A total of @ patients will be recruited from approximately @ ICUs in the United Kingdom .
Conclusion	This trial will test the efficacy of levosimendan to reduce acute organ dysfunction in adult patients who have septic shock and evaluate its biological mechanisms of action .

Background	Factors and outcomes associated with end-of-life decision-making among patients during clinical trials in the intensive care unit are unclear .
Problem	We sought to determine patterns and outcomes of Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) decisions among critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) enrolled in a clinical trial .
Method	We performed a secondary analysis of data from the ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial ( FACTT ) , collected between @ and @ .
Method	We calculated mortality outcomes stratified by code status , and compared baseline characteristics of patients who became DNR during the trial with participants who remained full code .
Result	Among @ FACTT participants with a code status recorded , @ ( @ % ) elected DNR status .
Result	Specifically , @ ( @ % ) chose to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation alone , @ ( @ % ) elected to withhold some life support measures in addition to cardiopulmonary resuscitation , and @ ( @ % ) had life support withdrawn .
Result	Admission severity of illness as measured by APACHE III score was strongly associated with election of DNR status ( odds ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	Almost all ( @ % ; @ of @ ) patients who selected DNR status died , and @ % ( @ of @ ) of patients who died during the trial were DNR .
Result	Among patients who chose DNR status but did not elect withdrawal of life support , @ % ( @ of @ ) died .
Conclusion	The vast majority of deaths among clinical trial patients with ARDS were preceded by a DNR order .
Conclusion	Unlike other studies of end-of-life decision-making in the intensive care unit , nearly all patients who became DNR died .
Conclusion	The impact of variation of practice in end-of-life decision-making during clinical trials warrants further study .

Problem	To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) for patients with depression in hospital using a pragmatic randomised controlled trial .
Method	@ patients with depression were randomly divided into two groups ( randomisation ratio @:@ for treatment and control groups ( CGs ) , respectively ) and @ patients completed the study .
Method	The @ patients in the treatment group ( TG ) underwent acupuncture and received an SSRI and the @ patients in the CG received an SSRI only .
Method	The @-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-@ ) was used to quantitatively assess patients after @ , @ , @ and @weeks of treatment .
Result	The mean ( SD ) baseline total HDRS scores were @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) in the TG and CG , respectively .
Result	After the first week of treatment the HDRS score for the TG was reduced to @ ( @ ) , significantly different from the score of @ ( @ ) for the CG , p < @ .
Result	This significant difference was maintained to the end of the @-week treatment period , when HDRS scores had fallen to @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) for the TG and CG , respectively .
Conclusion	Acupuncture combined with an SSRI showed a statistically significant benefit for patients with depression in hospital over the @-week period compared with SSRIs alone .
Conclusion	This reduction in symptoms started in the first week and continued throughout the @weeks of treatment .

Problem	To determine the subjective and objective outcomes of retroperitoneoscopic vs open pyeloplasty with minimal incision in a prospective randomized comparison study .
Method	In this study between August @ to July @ , @ patients underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty and @ open pyeloplasty with minimal incision ( incision length < @ cm ) after randomization .
Method	The @ groups were compared for the visual pain score on the first and second postoperative days as the primary end point of the study .
Method	Complications were recorded and graded using Dindo-modified Clavien classification of surgical complications .
Method	Success rates were evaluated by improvement in pain score and objectively by diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid renal scan and other parameters .
Method	Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version @ ( IBM ) with P < @ considered statistically significant .
Result	The difference in the visual pain score ( @ vs @ on day @ ; @ vs @ on day @ ) and the diclofenac requirements ( @ vs @ mg ) were statistically significant and more in the open pyeloplasty .
Result	The hospital stay and convalescence were significantly lower in retroperitoneoscopic group .
Result	Success rate was found to be @ % with @ failure in each group .
Result	Two patients in retroperitoneoscopic group required conversion .
Result	Both groups showed significant improvement in pain score and drainage pattern on diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid scan with decrease in hydronephrosis on ultrasound evaluation .
Conclusion	Although subjective and objective outcomes are equivalent in both the groups , the retroperitoneoscopic approach is associated with significantly less pain , less analgesic requirement , shorter hospital stay and short convalescence in comparison with open pyeloplasty .

Background	Current guidelines recommend at least @ hours of electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring after an ischemic stroke to rule out atrial fibrillation .
Background	However , the most effective duration and type of monitoring have not been established , and the cause of ischemic stroke remains uncertain despite a complete diagnostic evaluation in @ to @ % of cases ( cryptogenic stroke ) .
Background	Detection of atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke has therapeutic implications .
Method	We conducted a randomized , controlled study of @ patients to assess whether long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor ( ICM ) is more effective than conventional follow-up ( control ) for detecting atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke .
Method	Patients @ years of age or older with no evidence of atrial fibrillation during at least @ hours of ECG monitoring underwent randomization within @ days after the index event .
Method	The primary end point was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation ( lasting > @ seconds ) within @ months .
Method	Among the secondary end points was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation within @ months .
Method	Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Result	By @ months , atrial fibrillation had been detected in @ % of patients in the ICM group ( @ patients ) versus @ % of patients in the control group ( @ patients ) ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
Result	By @ months , atrial fibrillation had been detected in @ % of patients in the ICM group ( @ patients ) versus @ % of patients in the control group ( @ patients ) ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P < @ ) .
Conclusion	ECG monitoring with an ICM was superior to conventional follow-up for detecting atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke .
Conclusion	( Funded by Medtronic ; CRYSTAL AF ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ . )

Problem	Insomnia patients complain that mental events keep them awake .
Problem	This study investigates how cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) affects such events and considers how attributional , cognitive and psychopathological symptoms may mediate sleep improvement .
Method	A pragmatic , parallel-group randomized controlled trial of @ adults ( @ F : ( mean @ years ( @-@ years ) ) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , @th Edition ( DSM-@ ) criteria for insomnia disorder , assigned to CBT ( n = @ ; @ F ) , imagery relief therapy ( IRT placebo ; n = @ ; @ F ) , or treatment as usual ( TAU ; n = @ ; @ F ) , was conducted .
Method	CBT/IRT comprised six online sessions delivered by an animated therapist , with automated web/e-mail support .
Method	CBT users had access to a moderated community .
Method	TAU comprised ` usual care ' .
Method	Participants completed the Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire ( SDQ ) , Glasgow Content of Thoughts Inventory ( GCTI ) , Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales ( DASS ) and Sleep Condition Indicator ( SCI ) at baseline , post treatment and @-week follow-up .
Result	The sample was characterised by mental arousal , notably ` trying too hard ' to sleep ( SDQ ) , and by ` sleep and sleeplessness ' and ` rehearsal and planning ' thoughts ( GCTI ) .
Result	Treatment effects were observed for all SDQ domains ( e.g. , CBT vs. IRT : d = @ for ` trying too hard ' ) .
Result	CBT was also superior to IRT on the GCTI ( e.g. , ` rehearsal and planning ' , d = @ ; ` sleep and sleeplessness ' , d = @ ) .
Result	CBT vs. TAU comparisons yielded larger effects , whereas placebo effects ( IRT vs. TAU ) were small to moderate .
Result	Hierarchical regression demonstrated partial mediation of SCI improvement by attributional and cognitive factors ( R@ = @-@ % ) following CBT .
Result	Improvement in sleep efficiency appears to be independent of such factors .
Conclusion	Online CBT modifies sleep-related attributions , night-time thought content and psychopathology .
Conclusion	This process partly mediates improvement in DSM-@-defined insomnia .

Problem	Cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome ( CACS ) is common in advanced cancer patients and associated with weight loss , fatigue , impaired quality of life ( QoL ) , and poor prognosis .
Problem	The goal of this project was to identify the most responsive items from two QoL measures in the ROMANA @ ( NCT@ ) phase III global study evaluating anamorelin HCl in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cachexia : the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue ( FACIT-F ) and the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy ( FAACT ) .
Method	In the ROMANA @ trial , @ patients with unresectable stage III or IV NSCLC and cachexia were to be enrolled and randomized ( @:@ ) to receive anamorelin HCl or placebo once daily for @weeks .
Method	All @ patients who reached the week @ visit at the time of data analysis were included .
Method	Co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in lean body mass and handgrip strength .
Method	QoL was a secondary outcome with FACIT-F and FAACT questionnaires administered at baseline and at weeks @ , @ , @ , and @ .
Result	Two @-item scales ( fatigue/activity and appetite/eating ) from the FACIT-F and FAACT questionnaires , respectively , demonstrated good internal consistency reliability , validity , and responsiveness ( also referred to as the Simplified Evaluation of Fatigue ( SEF ) and Simplified Evaluation of Appetite ( SEA ) , respectively ) .
Result	The estimated important difference for each scale was @-@ points .
Conclusion	These brief scales provide the psychometric properties necessary to promote future research in NSCLC patients with CACS .
Conclusion	Additional work should examine the clinical utility of these scales and their impact on treatment decision-making .

Problem	The influence of variations in exercise mode , thermal state , and load carriage on cardiac and ventilatory predictors of metabolic rate were investigated .
Method	Fifteen males were studied at rest and during whole - , upper - , and lower-body exercise ( unloaded and loaded ) under thermoneutral and hot conditions .
Result	Ventilatory predictions were superior in thermoneutral ( residual mean square error range : @ to @ Lmin ( -@ ) vs @ to @ Lmin ( -@ ) ) and hot conditions ( @ to @ Lmin ( -@ ) vs @ to @ Lmin ( -@ ) ) .
Result	Predictions derived from whole - or lower-body exercise , and unloaded or loaded exercise could be interchanged without significant error .
Result	Nevertheless , a mode-specific prediction was required for upper-body work , and mild hyperthermia significantly reduced the precision of cardiac predictions .
Conclusion	Ventilatory predictions were more precise , but errors from heart-rate predictions could be minimized by using thermal-state and exercise mode-specific predictions .

Problem	People with diabetes frequently develop vascular disease .
Problem	We investigated the relationship between blood @-hydroxyvitamin D ( @OH-D ) concentration and vascular disease risk in type @ diabetes .
Method	The relationships between blood @OH-D concentration at baseline and the incidence of macrovascular ( including myocardial infarction and stroke ) and microvascular ( retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , and amputation ) disease were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression in an observational study of patients in the @-year Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trial .
Result	A total of @ % of the patients had low vitamin D concentrations , as indicated by median blood @OH-D concentration of @ nmol/L .
Result	These patients with a blood @OH-D concentration < @ nmol/L had a higher cumulative incidence of macrovascular and microvascular events than those with levels @ nmol/L .
Result	Multivariate analysis , stratified by treatment and adjusted for relevant confounders , identified blood @OH-D concentration as an independent predictor of macrovascular events .
Result	A @ nmol/L difference in blood @OH-D concentration was associated with a @ % ( P = @ ) change in risk of macrovascular complications during the study , and further adjustments for seasonality , hs-CRP , and physical activity level had little impact .
Result	The unadjusted risk of microvascular complications was @ % ( P = @ ) higher during the study , though the excess risk declined to @-@ % and lost significance with adjustment for HbA@c , seasonality , or physical activity .
Conclusion	Low blood @OH-D concentrations are associated with an increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease events in type @ diabetes .
Conclusion	However , a causal link remains to be demonstrated .

Problem	To investigate the efficacy of a proactive feeding regimen ( PFR ) in reducing hospital length of stay in a population of moderately preterm small for gestational age ( SGA ) infants .
Method	SGA infants ( z-score < -@ ) of gestational age ( GA ) @-@ weeks and birth weight ( BW ) > @ g were allocated at random to receive either a PFR , starting with @ mL/kg/day and gradually increasing to @ mL/kg/day by day @ , or a standard feeding regimen , starting with @ mL/kg/day and gradually increasing to @ mL/kg/day by day @ .
Method	All infants received human milk .
Result	A total of @ infants were randomized to the @ groups , @ to the PFR group ( mean GA , @ @ weeks ; mean BW , @ @ g ) and @ to the standard feeding regimen group ( mean GA , @ @ weeks ; mean BW , @ @ g ) .
Result	Infants in the PFR group were discharged significantly earlier ( mean , @ @ days vs @ @ days ; P = @ ) .
Result	The need for intravenous fluids ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) and the incidence of hypoglycemia ( @ vs @ % ; P = @ ) were significantly lower in the PFR group .
Result	Feeding intolerance and fecal calprotectin levels did not differ between the @ groups .
Conclusion	A PFR in moderately preterm SGA infants is well tolerated and significantly reduces both the length of stay and the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia .

Background	Long-term adaptive servoventilation ( ASV ) increases cardiac function more effectively than continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , possibly via alleviation of sympathetic overactivation .
Background	The present study evaluated the effect of ASV and CPAP at comparable pressure on muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) in patients with heart failure ( HF ) and with or without periodic breathing ( PB ) .
Result	A total of @ patients with HF ( ejection fraction < @ ) were randomized to receive CPAP ( n = @ ) or ASV ( n = @ ) .
Result	Respiratory profiles and MSNA were continuously monitored before and during CPAP and ASV ( @min ) at pressures of @ and @ cmH@O , respectively .
Result	The severity of respiratory instability was determined using the coefficient of variation of tidal volume ( CV-TV ) .
Result	Although heart rate and blood pressure remained unchanged , only ASV improved CV-TV .
Result	MSNA decreased in the ASV ( P < @ ) , but not in the CPAP group .
Result	The change in CV-TV independently predicted changes in MSNA ( P < @ ) .
Result	Device type and PB significantly interacted with changes in MSNA ( P < @ ) and ASV exerted sympathoinhibitory effects in patients with PB , whereas CPAP did not .
Result	A sympathoinhibitory effect in patients without PB was not evident in either treatment arm .
Conclusion	ASV probably exerts its sympathoinhibitory effects in patients with HF and PB through pressure support .

Problem	Anatomy education on embalmed specimens is presumed to have added educational value .
Problem	However , although embalmed specimens have been used for anatomy education for years , there is little evidence on the added educational value of dissection-based teaching .
Problem	The objective of this randomized study is to examine the added value of dissection-based teaching , using models of the inguinal region in embalmed specimens .
Method	In @ , medical students at Erasmus Medical Center , The Netherlands , were randomly assigned to three groups .
Method	Group I attended lectures , group II attended dissection-based training using laparoscopic dissection models , and group III attended lectures as well as dissection-based laparoscopic training .
Method	To assess the improvement of anatomical knowledge , all students had to complete a practical test before , immediately after , and two weeks after training .
Method	Data were analyzed with mixed modeling .
Result	Forty-six students participated in this study .
Result	No significant difference in results was observed among the three groups before the start of training .
Result	Immediately after the course , groups II and III scored significantly higher than group I ( P < @ ; P < @ ) , and group II scored higher than group III ( P = @ ) .
Result	The difference between group I and groups II and III persisted during follow-up ( P = @ ; P = @ ) .
Result	The difference between groups II and III disappeared .
Conclusion	Three-dimensional anatomy education with dissection models enhances anatomy learning by medical students .
Conclusion	Students who received dissection-based training scored higher in the short - and long term compared with students who did not receive this type of education .

Problem	To determine the safety and efficacy of low-voltage , external-beam , stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
Method	Randomized , double-masked , sham-controlled , multicenter , clinical trial .
Method	A total of @ participants with neovascular AMD who received @ ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections within the preceding year and requiring treatment at enrollment .
Method	Participants received @ Gray , @ Gray , or sham SRT .
Method	All arms received pro re nata ( PRN ) ranibizumab for @ months , with PRN bevacizumab or ranibizumab thereafter .
Method	Mean number of PRN injections ; best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) ; loss of < @ Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters ; change in optical coherence tomography central subfield thickness ; and change in angiographic total lesion area and choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) area .
Result	At year @ , the @ and @ Gray arms received fewer PRN treatments compared with sham ( mean @ , P = @ ; mean @ , P = @ ; and mean @ , respectively ) .
Result	Change in mean BCVA was -@ , -@ , and -@ letters for the @ Gray , @ Gray , and sham arms , respectively , with @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , and @ participants ( @ % ) , respectively , losing < @ letters .
Result	Mean central subfield thickness decreased by @ m , @ m , and @ m , respectively .
Result	Mean total active lesion area increased by @ , @ , and @ mm ( @ ) , respectively .
Result	Mean CNV area decreased by @ mm ( @ ) in all groups .
Result	An independent reading center detected microvascular abnormalities in @ control eyes and @ SRT eyes , of which @ were attributed to radiation ; however , only @ of these possibly affected vision .
Result	An exploratory subgroup analysis found that lesions with a greatest linear dimension @ mm ( the size of the treatment zone ) and a macular volume greater than the median ( @ mm ( @ ) ) were more responsive to SRT , with @ PRN injections versus @ in comparable sham-treated participants ( P = @ ) and mean BCVA @ letters superior to sham ( P = @ ) .
Conclusion	A single dose of SRT significantly reduces intravitreal injections over @ years .
Conclusion	Radiation can induce microvascular change , but in only @ % of eyes does this possibly affect vision .
Conclusion	The best response occurs when AMD lesions fit within the treatment zone and they are actively leaking .

Problem	To compare integrated automated load distributing band CPR ( iA-CPR ) with high-quality manual CPR ( M-CPR ) to determine equivalence , superiority , or inferiority in survival to hospital discharge .
Method	Between March @ , @ and January @ , @ a randomized , unblinded , controlled group sequential trial of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac origin was conducted at three US and two European sites .
Method	After EMS providers initiated manual compressions patients were randomized to receive either iA-CPR or M-CPR .
Method	Patient follow-up was until all patients were discharged alive or died .
Method	The primary outcome , survival to hospital discharge , was analyzed adjusting for covariates , ( age , witnessed arrest , initial cardiac rhythm , enrollment site ) and interim analyses .
Method	CPR quality and protocol adherence were monitored ( CPR fraction ) electronically throughout the trial .
Result	Of @ randomized patients , @ ( @ % ) met post enrollment exclusion criteria .
Result	Therefore , @ ( @ % ) received iA-CPR and @ ( @ % ) M-CPR .
Result	Sustained ROSC ( emergency department admittance ) , @h survival and hospital discharge ( unknown for @ cases ) for iA-CPR compared to M-CPR were @ ( @ % ) vs. @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) vs. @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) vs. @ ( @ % ) patients , respectively .
Result	The adjusted odds ratio of survival to hospital discharge for iA-CPR compared to M-CPR , was @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , meeting the criteria for equivalence .
Result	The @ min CPR fraction was @ % for iA-CPR and @ % for M-CPR .
Conclusion	Compared to high-quality M-CPR , iA-CPR resulted in statistically equivalent survival to hospital discharge .

Problem	The phosphodiesterase type @ inhibitor tadalafil is approved for the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .
Problem	While tadalafil significantly improves overall lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH ( LUTS/BPH ) , improvements in nocturia were not significant in individual studies .
Problem	We therefore sought to further assess nocturia based on data integrated from four tadalafil registrational studies .
Method	Data were integrated from four randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , @-week registrational studies of tadalafil for LUTS/BPH .
Method	Nocturia was assessed as nighttime voiding frequency using the International Prostate Symptom Score question @ ( IPSS Q@ ) .
Method	Efficacy results were analyzed using analysis of covariance .
Result	For the tadalafil @ mg once daily ( N = @ ) and placebo ( N = @ ) groups , baseline characteristics were well balanced , and the overall severity of nocturia per mean IPSS Q@ was @ @ .
Result	The mean treatment change was -@ with placebo and -@ with tadalafil ; the least-squares mean ( standard error ) treatment difference was -@ ( @ ) , p = @ .
Result	For patients receiving placebo and tadalafil , respectively , the proportion with improved nocturnal frequency was @ and @ % , with no change was @ and @ % , and with worsening was @ and @ % .
Conclusion	A statistically significant improvement in nocturnal frequency was seen with tadalafil over placebo ; however , the treatment difference was small and not considered clinically meaningful .
Conclusion	Further studies using voiding diaries and excluding patients with nocturnal polyuria would be needed to more precisely estimate the impact of tadalafil on nocturia associated with LUTS/BPH .

Problem	To determine the impact of educational materials ( EMs ) on the treatment compliance of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive ( HR + ) early-stage breast cancer .
Method	Patients ( n = @ ) were randomized to standard aromatase inhibitors ( AI ) alone ( group A ) or with EMs ( group B ) in a global , real-world setting .
Result	The @-year results ( n = @ ) showed EMs had no impact on compliance ( @ vs. @ % , group A vs. B ) , compliance with initial AI ( @ vs. @ % ) or persistence ( @ vs. @ % ) , confirming the @-year interim analysis ( n = @ ) .
Result	Of the @ patients considered compliant at @ year , @ % remained compliant at @ years .
Result	Discontinuations ( @ % ) were mainly attributed to AI-related side effects ( @ % of discontinuations ) .
Result	Exploratory analyses suggest a relationship between patient characteristics and compliance behaviors .
Conclusion	EMs do not improve compliance in this patient population .
Conclusion	Compliance and persistence are complex end points influenced by multiple variables .
Conclusion	Side effects were the main reasons for discontinuations .

Background	The relation between visceral fat accumulation and development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders has been demonstrated .
Background	The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a new ultrasound visceral fat thickness ( VFT ) measurement and clinical and anthropometric data in a consecutive series of obese patients .
Method	Fifty-five consecutive male obese patients underwent ultrasound evaluation and metabolic and anthropometric parameters determination at baseline and after @ weeks of a very low-calorie diet ( VLCD ) therapy .
Method	The new ultrasound measurement , the thickness of the fat between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery ( AMFT ) , was determined along with the maximum thickness of preperitoneal fat and the global VFT .
Result	AMFT showed a better correlation than VFT and preperitoneal fat with all anthropometric and metabolic parameters , both at baseline and after VLCD regimen .
Result	At baseline , patients in the middle and high AMFT and VFT tertiles had a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic diseases with respect to AMFT and VFT low tertile patients , whereas after VLCD period , AMFT only showed significant difference within tertiles .
Result	The odds ratios for the various metabolic diseases were higher in the middle and high AMFT tertiles than those in the middle and high VFT tertiles , remaining significant after adjustment for age , body mass index and VLCD regimen only in the middle and high AMFT tertiles .
Conclusion	The ultrasonographic AMFT evaluation is strongly correlated to the presence of metabolic syndrome and could be a valuable tool to predict metabolic diseases and associated cardiovascular risks in men .

Background	Some characteristics of assessments exert a strong influence on how students study .
Background	Understanding these pre-assessment learning effects is of key importance to the designing of medical assessments that foster students ' reasoning abilities .
Background	Perceptions of the task demands of an assessment significantly influence students ' cognitive processes .
Background	However , why and how certain tasks positively ` drive ' learning remain unknown .
Background	Medical tasks can be assessed as coherent meaningful whole tasks ( e.g. examining a patient based on his complaint to find the diagnosis ) or can be divided into simpler part tasks ( e.g. demonstrating the physical examination of a pre-specified disease ) .
Background	Comparing the benefits of whole-task and part-task assessments in a randomised controlled experiment could guide the design of ` assessments for learning ' .
Problem	The purpose of this study was to determine whether the knowledge that an objective structured clinical examination ( OSCE ) will contain whole tasks , as opposed to part tasks , increases the use of diagnostic reasoning by medical students when they study for this assessment .
Method	In this randomised , controlled , mixed-methods experiment , @ medical students were randomly paired and filmed while studying together for two imminent physical examination OSCE stations .
Method	Each @-minute study period began with video cues and ended with a questionnaire on cognitive loads .
Method	Cues disclosed either a part-task OSCE station ( examination of a healthy patient ) or a whole-task OSCE station ( hypothesis-driven physical examination -LSB- HDPE -RSB- ) .
Method	In a crossover design , sequences were randomised for both task and content ( shoulder or spine ) .
Method	Two blinded and independent authors scored all @ videos in distinct randomised orders , listening to participants studying freely .
Method	Mentioning a diagnosis in association with a sign was scored as a backward association , and the opposite was scored as a forward association ; both revealed the use of diagnostic reasoning .
Method	Qualitative data were obtained through group interviews .
Result	Studying for whole-task OSCE stations resulted in a greater use of diagnostic reasoning .
Result	Qualitative data triangulate these findings and show the precedence of cues sourced from the ` student grapevine ' .
Conclusion	In comparison with ` traditional ' part-task OSCEs , whole-task OSCEs like the HDPE increase students ' use of diagnostic reasoning during study time .
