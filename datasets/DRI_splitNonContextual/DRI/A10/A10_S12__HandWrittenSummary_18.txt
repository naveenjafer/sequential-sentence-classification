In this paper, we present a parallel skinning algorithm suitable for SIMD architectures such as GPUs.
 The joint weights of each vertex are automatically computed by NNLS and used in the skinning computation for SSD and WPSD.

 Independent per-vertex deformation is parallelized on the GPU using three rendering passes.

 Articulated body skinning using SSD, PSD, and WPSD are efficiently parallelized by our GPU-based method, and on a detailed model, we obtain around 20 times speed-up compared with CPU-based computation
