This paper introduced a new framework for highly adaptive liquid simulation at large scales. This method out-performs previous methods in cases of extreme spatial adaptivity by exhibiting smoother surfaces and presenting visually interesting regions of a fluid flow, while remaining computationally efficient and avoiding common artifacts.
This method combines several key components to drastically speed up the simulation of large-scale fluid phenomena: they leverage an alternative Eulerian tetrahedral mesh discretization to significantly reduce the complexity of the pressure solve while increasing the robustness with respect to element quality and removing the possibility of locking. Next, they enable subtle free-surface phenomena by deriving novel second-order boundary conditions consistent with the discretization. They couple this discretization with a spatially adaptive Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, enabling efficient, robust, minimally-dissipative simulations that can undergo sharp changes in spatial resolution while minimizing artifacts. Along the way, they provide a new method for generating a smooth and detailed surface from a set of particles with variable sizes. Finally, they explore several new sizing functions for determining spatially adaptive simulation resolutions, and show how to couple them to the simulator. 
These contributions work together to produce a practical fluid simulator that exhibits low computational and memory complexity, fewer visual artifacts, and a high effective simulation resolution. They are highly interested in applying the method to other types of phenomena, such as smoke and fire simulations, or visco-elastic materials in the future work.
