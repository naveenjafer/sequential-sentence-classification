One of the most important aspect in computer graphics is the Physically-based cloth animation. To realistically animate clothing and represent wrinkles and folds,  high spatial resolution is a prerequisite. This paper explains why implicit simulation methods are preferable than explicit ones and demonstrates a method for faster performance based on implicit methods for cloth which stably uses larger step sizes than explicit methods. The paper presents a simulation system that uses a triangular mesh for cloth surfaces, eliminating topological restrictions of rectangular meshes, and a simple but versatile formulation of the internal cloth energy forces. Collisions between cloth and solid objects are handled by preventing cloth particles from interpenetrating solid objects. Moreover this paper presents a simple unified treatment of damping forces, a subject which has been largely ignored thus far. The performance summary of our simulation system highlight fast performance which outranges simulators based on explicit integration methods.
