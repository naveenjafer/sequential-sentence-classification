One important fact is that most fabrics do not stretch under their own weight. Unfortunately, for many popular cloth solvers, a reduction of permissible stretching is synonymous with degradation in performance. In this paper is presented an approach which alleviates this problem by introducing a numerical solver that excels at timestepping quasi-inextensible surfaces (stretching below 1%). More analytically this paper proposes a method to obtain very low strain along the warp and weft direction using Constrained Lagrangian Mechanics and a novel fast projection method.
Numerical evidence support the observation that a constraint-based method is inherently well-suited to operate in the quasi-inextensible regime. Moreover, implicit methodâ€™s nonlinear equations correspond to a minimization problem: this result motivates a fast projection method for enforcing inextensibility.
The presented projection approach performs fast as a simple and efficient velocity filter, as part of a framework that decouples timestepping, inextensibility, and collision passes.
