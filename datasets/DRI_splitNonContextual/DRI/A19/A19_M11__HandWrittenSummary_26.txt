The development of physics-based locomotion controllers de novo, independent from stock motion data, has been a long-standing objective in computer graphics research and has seen resurgence in recent years. Despite impressive progress, the gaits produced by existing controllers fall short of the natural appearance of human locomotion. The goal of our work is to enhance the realism of locomotion gaits exhibited by physically-simulated humanoids without dependence on motion capture data.

We have presented a biologically-motivated control parameterization that can be used to automatically generate 3D human-like walking and running controllers of different speeds. Controllers are optimized to satisfy a set of high-level task terms while minimizing an effort term based on modeling the rate of metabolic energy expenditure. Notably, walking and running emerge from the same optimization process simply by changing the target velocity and initialization. Through comparisons to kinematic and torque data of human walking, we show that our results adopt a human-like torque generation strategy while producing kinematic data significantly closer to humans than previous work. Our work demonstrates the importance of modeling constraints on torque generation due to muscle physiology, both in restricting the space of possible torque trajectories and in providing a realistic model of effort.

Finally, an exciting area for future work is to automatically synthesize locomotion controllers for more detailed, fully muscle-actuated human models [Weinstein et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009].
