This paper presents a system for rapid editing of highly dynamic motion capture data. We take the approach to acquiring similar motions is to adapt a single motion sequence several times to synthesize a family of motions that preserve physics constraints. Motions created in this manner can satisfy an animatorâ€™s exact specifications with a minimum of deviation from the initial motion sequence.  Our system is based on an optimization algorithm that can transform the captured motion to satisfy high-level user constraints while preserving physical realism.Our system provides a set of UI tools to help the user rapidly specify modifications to existing motions. Moreover, in this paper we suggest that using physics-based adaptation to create motion samples for the purpose of data interpolation is perhaps a "sweetspot" between these two approaches.The primary contribution of this work is a new momentum-based method for adaptation of ballistic character movement.
