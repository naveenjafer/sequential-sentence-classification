Motion is one of the most important ingredients of CG movies and computer games. A standard solution is motion capture: motion data for an approximate skeletal hierarchy of the subject is recorded and then used to drive a reconstruction on the computer. However, it is very hard to obtain motions that do exactly what the animator wants. Satisfying complex timed constraints is difficult and may involve many motion capture iterations. Besides, most motion capture systems are very expensive to use, because the motion data tends not to be re-used. 

In this paper, the authors present a completely automatic framework that allows synthesis of new motion data meeting a wide variety of constraints. Since for many kinds of constraints the motion synthesis problem is underconstrained, they took a randomized search approach to design their method, which is well suited to find many different motions that satisfy the constraints. The randomized search scales linearly as a function of the database size with a very small constant. As a result, they have presented a framework that allows interactive synthesis of natural looking motions that adhere to user specified constraints. This framework can work on any motion dataset as well: it can be created by traditional key framing, physically based modelling or motion capture. Besides, since the generated motions are obtained by putting pieces of motions in the dataset, the resulting motions will also carry the underlying style of the data.
