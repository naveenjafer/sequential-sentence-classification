This paper describes a technique that cuts and pastes bits and pieces of example motions together to create such a motion. First, the method build a directed motion graph form the collection of motion sequences. The standard motion graph may be extremely large and not suitable for latter operations such as searching for a particular movement. Therefore, the authors collapse all the nodes (frames) belonging to the same motion sequence together. The clustering method does not operate on body configurations and our probabilistic search strategy is more effective than dynamic programming as it will be explained below. Then hard and soft constraints are defined. Sequences are scored using an objective function that reflects how well the constraint has been met and attempt to find extremal sequences. Finding paths in the motion graph that satisfy the hard constraints and optimize soft constraints involves a graph search. However, for even a small collection of motions, the graph G has a large number of edges and straightforward search of this graph is computationally prohibitive. The authors proposed a random search algorithm which is linear and can be stopped and resumed at any time. The synthetic motion is assessed with four different criteria, including naturalness, artifacts, constraints and interactions. The limitation of this method is its dependency on the original database, in which way the synthetic motion is strictly bound to the the motions in the original database and the integrity of the database directly effects the quality of the synthetic motion.
