This paper shows that Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction (BFECC) can be applied to reduce dissipation and diffusion encountered in various advection steps in fluid simulation such as velocity, smoke density and image advections. BFECC can be implemented easily on top of the first order upwinding or semi-Lagrangian integration of advection equations, while providing second order accuracy both in space and time. When applied to level set evolution, BFECC reduces volume loss significantly. This paper combine these techniques with variable density projection and show that they yield a realistic animations of two-phase flows. This simple extension yields significant enhancements in reducing diffusion and dissipation in velocity, smoke, image advection and in preserving volume under various situations. Also, they demonstrate the benefits of this approach on the image advection and on the simulation of smoke, of bubbles in water, and of a highly dynamic interaction between water, a solid, and air.
