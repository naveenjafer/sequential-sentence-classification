The author's objective for this paper was to "present a new skinning technique for the deformation of computer-animated characters".
The technique/ method mentioned in this paper aims to "allow the animator to operate the software as a physically based authoring tool in the same way as other conventional deformation tools, by means of adopts this two-layered strategy".  For example "the weights are painted by the animator, and thus the animator has full control over the outcomes".
Looking at common practice, previous methods such as 'the smooth skinning approach' suffers from some notorious drawbacks, called the candy wrapper effect or collapsing elbow effect, due to its lack of consideration of volume preservation for the soft tissues.  This is an issue, however the drive for realism in computer graphics has lead to some new modelling and deformation techniques.  The author states that achieving this "requires the determination of the shape, number and the layout of the muscles underneath".
Most computer-animated characters are complex both geometrically and topologically.  The author suggests the simplicity of their method through use of the implementation includes three major surface modelling forms: Nurbs, subdivision surfaces and polygons.
The author compares previous work to what they aim to bring to the field and summarise by talking about their final methods and techniques to "deform the skin surface of a character", as as current and future work: "we are currently designing higher-level tools with an interactive user interface, which will hide this complexity from the user".
