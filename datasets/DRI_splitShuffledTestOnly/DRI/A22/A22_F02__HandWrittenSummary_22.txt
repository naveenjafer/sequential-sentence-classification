This article presents a semi-Lagrangian surface tracking method that explicitly represents the surface as a set of polygons. The new surface and corresponding signed-distance function can be efficiently and reliably constructed using adaptive octree data structures. One of the primary advantages of this method is that it enables tracking surface characteristics, such as color or texture coordinates, or even simulation variables, accurately at negligible additional cost. These properties can be easily stored directly on the polygonal mesh and efficiently mapped onto the new surface during semi-Lagrangian advection. 
At each timestep, a new surface is constructed by extracting the zero set of an advected signed-distance function. The explicit representation provides advantages on computing exact signed-distance values near the mesh and storing properties on mesh vertices. It also facilitates other common operations developed for manipulating and rendering triangle meshes. To avoid the topological difficulties of directly updating an explicit surface representation, the surface is updated in time through an implicit representation. The implicit representation is then used to construct a new mesh and extracted using a contouring algorithm. For its simplicity, robustness, and speed, marching-cubes method is used for contouring. After the triangle mesh has been extracted, true distance values are assigned to the vertices of octree. This process is known as redistancing, which comprises three steps: coarsen the octree; compute exact distances at vertices of cells; run a fast marching method over the remaining vertices. Finally, this method is able to produce detailed, flicker-free animations of complex fluid motions.
