In this article the authors present a surface tracking method that explicitly represents the surface as a set of polygons.  Their method have the following advantages. They have an explicit representation and an implicit representation for polygon surface.  The semi-Lagrangian advection contributes to a mapping between surfaces at adjacent timesteps. In addition, Their method does not have any ad hoc rules or parameters to tune. Most importantly, they are able to produce detailed, flicker-free animations of complex fluid motions.
