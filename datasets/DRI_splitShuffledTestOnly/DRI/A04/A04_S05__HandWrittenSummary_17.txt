This paper proposes a physically motivated deformation technique, called bar-net driven skinning.  A bar-net is a 3D mesh consisting of fixed nodes and deformable nodes.  The skinning is a two-layered stategy: a low-resolution control mesh, and a high-resolution fine mesh.  The control mesh is coupled to the skeleton by a traditional skinning technique and deforms with the skeleton.  The fine mesh follows the control mesh using a free-form deformation technique.  The technique follows the current animation workflow, with the addition of the bar-net, which is coupled with the low-res skin layer.

Bar-nets can deform realistically based on the physical properties leading to physically plausible outcomes.  In order to take advantage of the physics, The bar-net is coupled with the control mesh in areas where deformations are expected to occur.  The bar-net can also be coupled to the fine mesh to model wrinkles.

This paper devises a set of properties that an ‘ideal’ bar-net should satisfy, which make intuitive shape control and fast computation possible.  The properties are satisfied by a technique called the force-density method.  The user can manipulate the force on each node to tune the deformation interactively.

The new bar-net driven method attempts to combine the advantages of the anatomy-based approach, the smooth skinning approach and the physically based approach.  The method can achieve similar results to those of the anatomy-based techniques, but in an interactive manner.  Its main strength lies in the combination of speed, intuitiveness and good realism.
