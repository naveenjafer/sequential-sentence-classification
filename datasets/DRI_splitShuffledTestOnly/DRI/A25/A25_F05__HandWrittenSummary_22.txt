Simulation domains can change substantially from step to step because of deforming boundaries, moving obstacles, and evolving fluid motion, yet current systems based on fixed grids are not ideally suited to handle these situations. This paper presents a method for animating fluid using unstructured tetrahedral meshes that change at each time step.  The unstructured tetrahedral meshes conform well to curved and irregular boundaries better than axis-aligned grids with the same number of grid elements and allow for precise control of refinement throughout the domain.

They also describe a new, single-step method to achieve two-way coupling between obstacle and fluid motion, while general, benefits from remeshing.  The core idea of this system is based on the simple, efficient methods for discretizing the inviscid Euler equations on tetrahedral meshes, along with a generalization of the semi-Lagrangian velocity advection technique for moving meshes.  The meshes focus computation in the visually important parts of the domain can be generated quickly and reliably using existing techniques.  Because a new simulation mesh is generated at each time step, the viability of the method hinges on fast, high-quality, reliable tetrahedral mesh generation. They have found that the combination of unstructured tetrahedral domains and dynamic remeshing creates a versatile environment for the creation of complex and visually interesting fluid animations.
