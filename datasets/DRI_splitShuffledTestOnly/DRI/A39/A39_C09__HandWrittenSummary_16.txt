Physically-based cloth animation has been a problem of interest to the graphics community for more than a decade. In this paper, is described a cloth simulation system that is much faster than previously related simulation systems. This approach provides a faster performance which begins with the choice of an implicit numerical integration method to solve equation. In order to animate clothing, much higher spatial resolution is required to adequately represent realistic (or even semi-realistic) wrinkling and folding configurations. That implicit methods for cloth overcome the performance limits inherent in explicit simulation methods. It is also describe a simulation system that uses a triangular mesh for cloth surfaces, eliminating topological restrictions of rectangular meshes, and a simple but versatile formulation of the internal cloth energy forces.
