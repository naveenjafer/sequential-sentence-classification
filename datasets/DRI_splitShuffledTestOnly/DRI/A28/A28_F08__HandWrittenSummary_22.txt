This paper presented a new technique to model interactions between particle based fluids and mesh based deformable solids.  Fluids are represented by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach (SPH) and deformable solids are represented by a Finite Element approach.
The method is designed for the use in interactive systems such as virtual surgery simulators where the real-time interplay of liquids and surrounding tissue is important. In computer graphics, a variety of techniques have been proposed to model liquids and deformable objects at interactive rates.  As important as the plausible animation of these substances is the fast and stable modelling of their interaction.  This  paper  models  the  exchange of  momentum  between  Lagrangian  particle-based fluid  models  and  solids  represented  by  polygonal meshes. To model the solid-fluid interaction  they used virtual boundary particles. They are placed on the surface of the solid objects according to Gaussian quadrature rules allowing the computation of smooth interaction potentials that yield stable simulations.  The interaction model simulates repulsion, adhesion and friction near the fluid-solid interface.
They demonstrate the approach in an interactive simulation environment for fluids and deformable solids. This idea might be useful in other graphic domains as well, such as modelling with implicit surface and character skinning.
