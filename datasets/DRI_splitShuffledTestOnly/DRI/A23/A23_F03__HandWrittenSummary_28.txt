This paper presents a complete production system which enables animators to access the beauty and realism embodied in the physically accurate equations of motion, the Navier-Stokes equations. Some of the unique features of the system described in this paper include: a compressible version of the equations of motion; the use of images and animations for controlling the dynamics; fast accurate texture mapping features; and finally, a complete production system. The compressible formulation, unlike any in the graphics literature, allows for the modeling of compressible effects, such as shock waves, and also provides a mechanism for speeding up flow calculations by an order of magnitude or more. Animators can express themselves by controlling the simulation dynamics through a familiar user interfaceâ€”the use of images and animations. The inclusion of texture mapping differential equations, another new concept developed here, makes it possible to precalculate particle paths on a fixed grid which can be used in a straight-forward manner at render time. It allows deferred rendering of flow distortions, with no need to recompute particle trajectories through a time-evolving velocity field. One of the most useful ideas presented here for three-dimensional simulations is the implementation of an artificial speed of sound through the compressible formulation of the equations.
