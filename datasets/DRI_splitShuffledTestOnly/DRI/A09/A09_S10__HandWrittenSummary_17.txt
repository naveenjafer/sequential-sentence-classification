This paper presents a skinning technique called EigenSkin, which overcomes the problems of traditional SSD, and can be achieved using a memory-efficient linear correction to the SSD method.  EigenSkin introduces a method for extending SSD that enhances its range of modeling capabilities at very little cost, and in a manner optimized for real time graphics hardware.  The approach is to start with an artistâ€™s SSD approximation of a character, with additional geometry corresponding to particular key poses not well approximated by SSD.  Instead of storing displacement fields for each key pose and then interpolating between them at runtime, EigenSkin uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct an eigenvector basis for representing the potentially large set of pose corrections.  The deformations can be compactly represented in an efficient data-dependent basis and rendered in real time using vertex shaders in commodity graphics hardware.  A large class of pose-dependent quasi-static deformations can be described using the EigenSkin approach: EigenSkin allows subtle character deformations for skin and clothing, such as those derived from highly realistic artist-drawn poses, measurements from the real world, or laboriously computed anatomically and physically-based models.  EigenSkin can also correct for both shape and shading.  The method is demonstrated by rendering a very large finite element model of a human hand, at interactive rates on a PC with negligible cost to the main CPU.  With only five leading eigendisplacements, the EigenSkin approximation was essentially indistinguishable from the original FEM model.
