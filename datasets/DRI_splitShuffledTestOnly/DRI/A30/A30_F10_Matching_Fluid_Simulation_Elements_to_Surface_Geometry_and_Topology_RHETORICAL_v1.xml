      <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">One of the most visually compelling aspects of liquids is the variety of complex thin sheets and droplets that arise during splashing.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">However, these remain among the most difficult features to simulate plausibly and accurately with existing techniques.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">Such detailed behaviour is extremely computationally expensive to resolve because of the tremendous grid resolution required for both the fluid solver and the surface tracking mechanism.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Recent advances in explicit surface tracking with triangle meshes <CitSpan>[Wojtan et al. 2009; Brochu and Bridson 2009; Müller 2009]</CitSpan> have made feasible the geometric representation and manipulation of small features, without the loss of detail exhibited by implicit surface methods.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">However, when the surface is coupled to a standard Eulerian simulator, the liquid volume must first be resampled onto the simulation mesh or grid to provide geometric information for boundary conditions.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">As this resampling process typically destroys small details, they are invisible to the fluid solver and cannot be advanced appropriately.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">This can lead to a variety of visible artifacts including lingering surface noise, liquid behaving as if it were connected when it is not (and vice versa), and thin features simply halting in mid-air because the simulator fails to see them <CitSpan>[Bargteil et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2009]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">When combined with surface tension forces, noisy sub-mesh details can also severely hamper stability if they are not artificially smoothed out.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge_Goal">We will address these problems by constructing a simulator that “sees” every detail in the explicit liquid surface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We carefully generate pressure sample points near the liquid surface, build a Voronoi simulation mesh from these points and a background lattice, and apply a ghost fluid/finite volume pressure discretization which captures the precise position of the liquid interface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We couple this with a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme and a new approach to surface tension, arriving at a complete liquid simulator.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">In summary, our key contribution is coupling an explicit surface tracker to a Voronoi-based liquid simulator with: • a pressure sample placement strategy that captures the complete liquid surface geometry, • an accurate surface tension model combining mesh-based curvature estimates and ghost fluid boundary conditions, • embedded free surface and solid boundary conditions adapted to Voronoi cells, avoiding the need for more onerous conforming tetrahedral mesh generation, • and a new velocity interpolant over unstructured meshes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">The practical benefits of such a system include: • improved animation of detailed liquid features, including very thin sheets, tendrils and droplets, • elimination of noise in explicit surface tracking without nonphysical smoothing, • more detailed and less damped surface tension effects, • and faster semi-Lagrangian advection on unstructured meshes without increased dissipation.</Sentence>

<CitSpan>Goktekin et al. [2004]</CitSpan> experimented with a doubleresolution level set, trading better volume conservation for other artifacts.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">
<CitSpan>Bargteil et al.

<CitSpan>Kim et al. [2009]</CitSpan> coupled a high resolution particle level set to a low resolution ghost fluid-based liquid solver, but ensured that pressure projection captured all liquid geometry by resampling an inflated level set at the pressure grid resolution—however, this can exacerbate other artifacts, since liquid components behave as if half a cell-width larger than they appear.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Kim et al. also introduced extra surface smoothing to prevent retention of small-scale noise.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Mismatched resolutions have been found useful for deformable solids, particularly as surface details are expected to generally persist, unlike in liquids.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">For example, <CitSpan>Wojtan &amp; Turk [2008]</CitSpan> used a surface mesh coupled to a lower resolution finite element solver; forcing the simulation mesh to have the same topology, if not resolution, as the embedded surface mesh may improve realism <CitSpan>[Teran et al. 2005; Nesme et al. 2009]</CitSpan>.</Sentence>
        
        
          <H2>2.4 Surface Tension Models</H2>
          <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Approaches to surface tension generally fall into two categories: those which apply surface tension as a body force in a region around the interface via smeared delta functions <CitSpan>[Brackbill et al. 1992; Hong and Kim 2003; Zheng et al. 2006; Wojtan et al. 2009]</CitSpan>, and those which apply surface tension discontinuously at the interface, typically as a boundary condition in the pressure projection step.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The latter is exemplified by the ghost fluid method and related approaches <CitSpan>[Enright et al. 2003; Hong and Kim 2005; Hong et al. 2007]</CitSpan>, and has been shown to provide more realistic results.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Surface tension models can also be compared in terms of how the force itself is approximated.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In level set schemes, finite differences are often used to estimate mean curvature, though this can be quite inaccurate without careful modification (e.g. <CitSpan>[Shin 2007]</CitSpan>) and cannot capture small details.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">If a surface mesh is available, a more accurate approach is either to use mesh-based curvature operators (e.g. <CitSpan>[Meyer et al. 2002b]</CitSpan>), or as proposed recently, to model a physical tension directly in the surface mesh geometry <CitSpan>[Perot and Nallapati 2003; Brochu 2006; Wojtan and Turk 2008]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We take the best of each, computing an accurate force from the surface mesh and incorporating it precisely at the surface with the ghost fluid method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We also remedy a shortcoming of existing mesh-based approaches: that surface details below the simulation resolution add energy but cannot be correctly evolved by the solver; without correct feedback from the physics this noise tends to worsen and destroy stability.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">
<CitSpan>Wojtan &amp; Turk [2008]</CitSpan> handle this with Laplacian smoothing to eliminate small features: note, however, this non-physical operation is dissipative rather than conservative.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">By instead combining our surface tension model with a geometry-aware sampling, we ensure all relevant details are properly resolved.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This yields accurate and comparatively stable surface tension effects without artificial smoothing.</Sentence>
