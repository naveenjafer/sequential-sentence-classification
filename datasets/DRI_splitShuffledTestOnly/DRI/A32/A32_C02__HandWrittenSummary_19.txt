A geometric and texture based approach is presented to physically simulate cloth wrinkles in a fast and versatile way. As the majority of cloth wrinkles come from buckling instead of in-place deformation, the geometry of a coarse mesh would not work unless a small metric stiffness is set. The approach realizes overall area conversion within approximation of small deformation. The proposed algorithm uses a bump map to represent wrinkles on a coarse mesh and animate gross cloth deformations. The user interacts with the algorithm by providing the wrinkle pattern which displaces an initial triangular mesh in 3D space based on the computed wrinkling coefficients. Each triangle of the mesh gets deformed to modulate the wrinkle pattern and further used for rendering. Animation is possible via iterative calculation of the deformed mesh, keeping the same wrinkling coefficients. In this way, the process is significantly accelerated, gets suitable for real time animations in case of small meshes and has low computational demands.  To achieve more realistic deformations, multiple wrinkle patterns can be used along with user defined variances of wrinkling coefficients.
