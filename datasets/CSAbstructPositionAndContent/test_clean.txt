objective	0 In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions.
background	1 The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function.
background	2 This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient.
method	3 To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy.
result	4 We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.

background	1 The vision of next generation 5G wireless communications lies in providing very high data rates (typically of Gbps order), extremely low latency, manifold increase in base station capacity, and significant improvement in users' perceived quality of service (QoS), compared to current 4G LTE networks.
background	2 Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks.

background	1 While recent literature has partly advanced our understanding of mobile application business models, less attention has been given to identify the most successful business model especially in the game area.
objective	2 In this vein, this paper presents a comparative analysis of six Iranian android games in an app store “Iran Apps” which were top level games in terms of download and rate during a 3-month study.
result	3 The results reveal that freemium and In-app purchase models were more successful, while advertising model can be efficiently used as a complementary model.
result	4 This provides valuable insight into why some mobile applications are more successful than others.

background	1 Instagram is the fastest growing social network site globally.
objective	2 This study investigates motives for its use, and its relationship to contextual age and narcissism.
objective	3 A survey of 239 college students revealed that the main reasons for Instagram use are “Surveillance/Knowledge about others,” “Documentation,” “Coolness,” and “Creativity.

result	5 The next significant finding was a positive relationship between those who scored high in interpersonal interaction and using Instagram for coolness, creative purposes, and surveillance.
result	6 Another interesting finding shows that there is a positive relationship between high levels of social activity (traveling, going to sporting events, visiting friends, etc.) and being motivated to use Instagram as a means of documentation.
result	7 In reference to narcissism, there was a positive relationship between using Instagram to be cool and for surveillance.

background	1 Previous research has demonstrated that the experience of reading e-books is not equivalent to reading textbooks.
background	2 This study examines factors influencing preference for e-books as well as reported use of e-book content.
background	3 Although the present student cohort is the most technologically savvy to ever enter universities, students do not prefer e-books over textbooks regardless of their gender, computer use or comfort with computers.
background	4 No significant correlations existed between the number of e-books previously used and overall preference of e-books: Participants who had previously used an e-book still preferred print texts for learning.
background	5 Despite the ability to easily access supplemental content through e-books via hyperlinks and other features, students were more likely to use special features in print books than in e-books.

background	1 Spiking Neuron Networks (SNNs) are often referred to as the 3rd generation of neural networks.
background	2 Highly inspired from natural computing in the brain and recent advances in neurosciences, they derive their strength and interest from an accurate modeling of synaptic interactions between neurons, taking into account the time of spike firing.
background	3 SNNs overcome the computational power of neural networks made of threshold or sigmoidal units.
method	4 Based on dynamic event-driven processing, they open up new horizons for developing models with an exponential capacity of memorizing and a strong ability to fast adaptation.

background	1 Scholars in many disciplines have considered the antecedents and consequences of various forms of trust.
objective	2 This paper generates 11 propositions exploring the relationship between Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and the trust an individual places in the inanimate technology (technology trust) and models the effect of those relationships on HRIS implementation success.
method	3 Specifically, organizational, technological, and user factors are considered and modeled to generate a set of testable propositions that can subsequently be investigated in various organizational settings.
method	4 Eleven propositions are offered suggesting that organizational trust, pooled interdependence, organizational community, organizational culture, technology adoption, technology utility, technology usability, socialization, sensitivity to privacy, and predisposition to trust influence an individual’s level of trust in the HRIS technology (technology trust) and ultimately the success of an HRIS implementation process.
result	5 A summary of the relationships between the key constructs in the model and recommendations for future research are provided.

background	1 Credit card plays a very important rule in today's economy.
background	2 It becomes an unavoidable part of household, business and global activities.
background	3 Although using credit cards provides enormous benefits when used carefully and responsibly,significant credit and financial damagesmay be causedby fraudulent activities.
background	4 Many techniques have been proposed to confront thegrowthin credit card fraud.
background	5 However, all of these techniques have the same goal of avoiding the credit card fraud; each one has its own drawbacks, advantages and characteristics.
objective	6 In this paper, after investigating difficultiesof credit card fraud detection, we seek to review the state of the art in credit card fraud detection techniques, datasets and evaluation criteria.
method	7 The advantages and disadvantages of fraud detection methods are enumerated and compared.
method	8 Furthermore, a classification of mentioned techniques into two main fraud detection approaches, namely, misuses (supervised) and anomaly detection (unsupervised) is presented.
method	9 Again, a classification of techniques is proposed based on capability to process the numerical and categorical datasets.
method	10 Different datasets used in literatureare then described and grouped into real and synthesized data and the effective and common attributesare extracted for further usage.

background	3 To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use some real and artificial data sets and compare with the results of other algorithms in terms of the adjusted Rand index.
method	4 Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm takes a significantly reduced time in computation with comparable performance against the partitioning around medoids.

objective	1 In this paper, we propose a novel method for image inpainting based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).
method	2 We define a loss function consisting of two parts: (1) a contextual loss that preserves similarity between the input corrupted image and the recovered image, and (2) a perceptual loss that ensures a perceptually realistic output image.
method	3 Given a corrupted image with missing values, we use back-propagation on this loss to map the corrupted image to a smaller latent space.
method	4 The mapped vector is then passed through the generative model to predict the missing content.
result	5 The proposed framework is evaluated on the CelebA and SVHN datasets for two challenging inpainting tasks with random 80% corruption and large blocky corruption.
result	6 Experiments show that our method can successfully predict semantic information in the missing region and achieve pixel-level photorealism, which is impossible by almost all existing methods.

background	1 We present and explore the effectiveness of several variations on the All-Moves-As-First (AMAF) heuristic in Monte-Carlo Go.
result	2 Our results show that: • Random play-outs provide more information about the goodness of moves made earlier in the play-out.
background	3 • AMAF updates are not just a way to quickly initialize counts, they are useful after every play-out.
background	4 • Updates even more aggressive than AMAF can be even

background	1 Distant supervision for relation extraction is an efficient method to scale relation extraction to very large corpora which contains thousands of relations.
background	2 However, the existing approaches have flaws on selecting valid instances and lack of background knowledge about the entities.
method	3 In this paper, we propose a sentence-level attention model to select the valid instances, which makes full use of the supervision information from knowledge bases.
method	4 And we extract entity descriptions from Freebase and Wikipedia pages to supplement background knowledge for our task.
result	5 The background knowledge not only provides more information for predicting relations, but also brings better entity representations for the attention module.
result	6 We conduct three experiments on a widely used dataset and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the baseline systems significantly.

background	1 Increasing use of the World Wide Web as a B2C commercial tool raises interest in understanding the key issues in building relationships with customers on the Internet.
background	2 Trust is believed to be the key to these relationships.
background	3 Given the differences between a virtual and a conventional marketplace, antecedents and consequences of trust merit re-examination.
objective	4 This research identifies a number of key factors related to trust in the B2C context and proposes a framework based on a series of underpinning relationships among these factors.
objective	5 The findings in this research suggest that people are more likely to purchase from the web if they perceive a higher degree of trust in e-commerce and have more experience in using the web.
result	6 Customer’s trust levels are likely to be influenced by the level of perceived market orientation, site quality, technical trustworthiness, and user’s web experience.
method	7 People with a higher level of perceived site quality seem to have a higher level of perceived market orientation and trustworthiness towards e-commerce.
method	8 Furthermore, people with a higher level of trust in e-commerce are more likely to participate in e-commerce.
method	9 Positive ‘word of mouth’, money back warranty and partnerships with well-known business partners, rank as the top three effective risk reduction tactics.
result	10 These findings complement the previous findings on e-commerce and shed light on how to establish a trust relationship on the World Wide Web.

background	1 Most of a cell’s functional processes involve interactions among proteins, and a key challenge in proteomics is to better understand these complex interaction graphs at a systems level.
background	2 Because of their importance in development and disease, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been the subject of intense research in recent years.
background	3 In addition, a greater understanding of PPIs can be achieved through the detailed investigation of the protein domain interactions which mediate PPIs.
background	4 In this chapter, we describe recent efforts to predict interactions between proteins and between protein domains.
method	5 We also describe methods that attempt to use protein interaction data to infer protein function.
method	6 Protein-protein interactions directly contribute to protein functions, and implications about functions can often be made via PPI studies.
background	7 These inferences are based on the premise that the function of a protein may be discovered by studying its interaction with one or more proteins of known functions.
result	8 The second part of this chapter reviews recent computational approaches to predict protein functions from PPI networks.

background	1 Pose Machines provide a sequential prediction framework for learning rich implicit spatial models.
objective	2 In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation.
objective	3 The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation.
method	4 We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference.
method	5 Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure.
result	6 We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets.

background	1 This paper presents a new algorithm to implement causal ordering.
background	2 Causal ordering was first proposed in the ISIS system developed at Cornell University.
method	3 The interest of causal ordering in a distr ibuted system is that it is cheaper to realize than total ordering.
method	4 The implementation of causal ordering proposed in this paper uses logical clocks of Mat te rn-Fidge (which define a partial order between events in a distr ibuted system) and presents two advantages over the implementation in ISIS: (1) the information added to messages to ensure causal ordering is bounded by the number of sites in the system, and (2) no special protocol is needed to dispose of this added information when it has become useless.
result	5 The implementation of ISIS presents however advantages in the case of site failures.

objective	1 In this paper, we examine a number of SQL and socalled "NoSQL" data stores designed to scale simple OLTP-style application loads over many servers.
method	2 Originally motivated by Web 2.0 applications, these systems are designed to scale to thousands or millions of users doing updates as well as reads, in contrast to traditional DBMSs and data warehouses.
method	3 We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions.
result	4 These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.

background	1 The wealth of social information presented on Facebook is astounding.
background	2 While these affordances allow users to keep up-to-date, they also produce a basis for social comparison and envy on an unprecedented scale.
background	3 Even though envy may endanger users’ life satisfaction and lead to platform avoidance, no study exists uncovering this dynamics.
background	4 To close this gap, we build on responses of 584 Facebook users collected as part of two independent studies.
background	5 In study 1, we explore the scale, scope, and nature of envy incidents triggered by Facebook.
objective	6 In study 2, the role of envy feelings is examined as a mediator between intensity of passive following on Facebook and users’ life satisfaction.
method	7 Confirming full mediation, we demonstrate that passive following exacerbates envy feelings, which decrease life satisfaction.
result	8 From a provider’s perspective, our findings signal that users frequently perceive Facebook as a stressful environment, which may, in the long-run, endanger platform sustainability.

background	1 Speech separation is the task of separating target speech from background interference.
result	2 Traditionally, speech separation is studied as a signal processing problem.
background	3 A more recent approach formulates speech separation as a supervised learning problem, where the discriminative patterns of speech, speakers, and background noise are learned from training data.
objective	4 Over the past decade, many supervised separation algorithms have been put forward.
method	5 In particular, the recent introduction of deep learning to supervised speech separation has dramatically accelerated progress and boosted separation performance.
result	6 This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research on deep learning based supervised speech separation in the last several years.
method	7 We first introduce the background of speech separation and the formulation of supervised separation.
method	8 Then, we discuss three main components of supervised separation: learning machines, training targets, and acoustic features.
objective	9 Much of the overview is on separation algorithms where we review monaural methods, including speech enhancement speech-nonspeech separation, speaker separation multitalker separation, and speech dereverberation, as well as multimicrophone techniques.
method	10 The important issue of generalization, unique to supervised learning, is discussed.

background	1 This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm for the challenging problem of the classification of myoelectric signals for prostheses control.
background	2 The algorithm employs the orientation between a set of descriptors of muscular activities and a nonlinearly mapped version of them.
background	3 It incorporates information about the Electromyogram (EMG) signal power spectrum characteristics derived from each analysis window while correlating that with the descriptors of previous windows for robust activity recognition.
objective	4 The proposed idea can be summarized in the following three steps: 1) extract power spectrum moments from the current analysis window and its nonlinearly scaled version in time-domain through Fourier transform relations, 2) compute the orientation between the two sets of moments, and 3) apply data fusion on the resulting orientation features for the current and previous time windows and use the result as the final feature set.
result	5 EMG data collected from nine transradial amputees performing six classes of movements with different force levels is used to validate the proposed features.
result	6 When compared to other well-known EMG feature extraction methods, the proposed features produced an improvement of at least 4%.

background	1 Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite.
method	2 We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author.
method	3 We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm.
method	4 We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task.
result	5 Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well.

background	1 This paper presents a consensus model in group decision making under linguistic assessments.
background	2 It is based on the use of linguistic preferences to provide individuals' opinions, and on the use of fuzzy majority of consensus, represented by means of a linguistic quantifier.
method	3 Several linguistic consensus degrees and linguistic distances are defined, acting on three levels.
method	4 The consensus degrees indicate how far a group of individuals is from the maximum consensus, and linguistic distances indicate how far each individual is from current consensus labels over the preferences.
result	5 This consensus model allows to incorporate more human consistency in decision support systems.

background	1 Mobile business is a young promising industry created by the emergence of wireless data networks.
background	2 Similar to other emerging industries, it is characterized by a large number of uncertainties at different levels, in particular concerning technology, business strategy and consumer demand.
objective	3 This paper focuses on the strategic uncertainties, where a large number of actors are trying a number of strategic approaches to position themselves in the most favourable position in the value system.
method	4 This paper intends to apply a business model analysis methodology in order to better understand the strategic approaches of these actors.
objective	5 We argue that successful business models are likely to be the ones that best address the economic peculiarities underlying this industry, like mobility, network effects and natural monopolies.

objective	1 This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition.
method	2 We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation.
method	3 Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process.
method	4 Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations.
method	5 Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible.
result	6 Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99 % recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations.
result	7 The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition.
method	8 In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition.
other	9 The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html ).

background	1 Words have only one purpose in a technical context–the transmission of information.
background	2 When they fail to do that, they lead to confusion and misunderstanding.
method	3 "Distributed data processing" and "distributed processing" are two phrases which illustrate that axiom.
background	4 Like many other words in the lexicon of the computer professional, these have become cliches through over-use, losing much of their original meaning in the process.
objective	5 This paper is an attempt to reverse that trend.

background	1 Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as an effective technique for estimating data distributions.
objective	2 The basic setup consists of two deep networks playing against each other in a zero-sum game setting.
objective	3 However, it is not understood if the networks reach an equilibrium eventually and what dynamics makes this possible.
method	4 The current GAN training procedure, which involves simultaneous gradient descent, lacks a clear game-theoretic justification in the literature.
method	5 In this paper, we introduce regret minimization as a technique to reach equilibrium in games and use this to motivate the use of simultaneous GD in GANs.
result	6 In addition, we present a hypothesis that mode collapse, which is a common occurrence in GAN training, happens due to the existence of spurious local equilibria in non-convex games.
result	7 Motivated by these insights, we develop an algorithm called DRAGAN that is fast, simple to implement and achieves competitive performance in a stable fashion across different architectures, datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA), and divergence measures with almost no hyperparameter tuning.

background	1 Blendshapes”, a simple linear model of facial expression, is the prevalent approach to realistic facial animation.
background	2 It has driven animated characters in Hollywood films, and is a standard feature of commercial animation packages.
background	3 The blendshape approach originated in industry, and became a subject of academic research relatively recently.
method	4 This course describes the published state of the art in this area, covering both literature from the graphics research community, and developments published in industry forums.
method	5 We show that, despite the simplicity of the blendshape approach, there remain open problems associated with this fundamental technique.

objective	1 This paper investigates the popular neural word embedding method Word2vec as a source of evidence in document ranking.
method	2 In contrast to NLP applications of word2vec, which tend to use only the input embeddings, we retain both the input and the output embeddings, allowing us to calculate a different word similarity that may be more suitable for document ranking.
method	3 We map the query words into the input space and the document words into the output space, and compute a relevance score by aggregating the cosine similarities across all the query-document word pairs.
method	4 We postulate that the proposed Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) provides evidence that a document is about a query term, in addition to and complementing the traditional term frequency based approach.

background	1 Social media is bringing great challenges and wonderful opportunities for organizational learning.
method	2 With support of social media, organizations may facilitate the knowledge management process within firms (e.g., knowledge sharing), then to encourage employees to promote collaborative learning behaviors from e-learning to social learning.
method	3 There is a significant trend in the recent studies is increasing number of publications on social media supported knowledge management (SMKM).
background	4 However, previous SMKM studies have not been depicted well by combining work of both researchers in social media study and ones in KM (which supports organizational learning) study.
objective	5 By using CiteSpace, this paper mapped important references that lead trends of SMKM development, authors contributing greatly to this field and hot topics of all the related articles.
method	6 The way that SMKM study developed was analyzed according to the visualization of references and topics.
method	7 Furthermore, the two most important groups – topics from SM and those from KM study were studied respectively to compare their development in order to show the fusion, the separation and other relationship.
method	8 Finally, hottest trends and topics in these years and recent future were discussed to provide help for future work.

background	1 Scalable and effective exploration remains a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL).
background	2 While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the setting of discrete state and action spaces, these methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional deep RL scenarios.
background	3 As such, most contemporary RL relies on simple heuristics such as -greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise to the controls.
objective	4 This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent’s belief of environment dynamics.
method	5 We propose a practical implementation, using variational inference in Bayesian neural networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces.
method	6 VIME modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms.
result	7 We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse rewards.

background	1 A common way of dynamically scheduling jobs in a manufacturing system is by implementing dispatching rules.
method	2 The issues with this method are that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment and also that no “ideal” single rule exists for all the possible states that the system may be in.
method	3 Therefore, it would be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule for each instance.
method	4 To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach that uses machine learning can be used.
method	5 Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time.
result	6 In this paper, a literature review of the main machine learning based scheduling approaches from the last decade is presented.

background	1 The linear combination of forecasts is a procedure that has improved the forecasting accuracy for different time series.
background	2 In this procedure, each method being combined is associated to a numerical weight that indicates the contribution of the method in the combined forecast.
method	3 We present the use of machine learning techniques to define the weights for the linear combination of forecasts.
method	4 In this paper, a machine learning technique uses features of the series at hand to define the adequate weights for a pre-defined number of forecasting methods.
result	5 In order to evaluate this solution, we implemented a prototype that uses a MLP network to combine two widespread methods.
result	6 The experiments performed revealed significantly accurate forecasts.

background	1 This paper presents a survey on the current state-of-the-art in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Operating Systems (OSs).
background	2 In recent years, WSNs have received tremendous attention in the research community, with applications in battlefields, industrial process monitoring, home automation, and environmental monitoring, to name but a few.
background	3 A WSN is a highly dynamic network because nodes die due to severe environmental conditions and battery power depletion.
background	4 Furthermore, a WSN is composed of miniaturized motes equipped with scarce resources e.g., limited memory and computational abilities.
background	5 WSNs invariably operate in an unattended mode and in many scenarios it is impossible to replace sensor motes after deployment, therefore a fundamental objective is to optimize the sensor motes' life time.
background	6 These characteristics of WSNs impose additional challenges on OS design for WSN, and consequently, OS design for WSN deviates from traditional OS design.
objective	7 The purpose of this survey is to highlight major concerns pertaining to OS design in WSNs and to point out strengths and weaknesses of contemporary OSs for WSNs, keeping in mind the requirements of emerging WSN applications.
method	8 The state-of-the-art in operating systems for WSNs has been examined in terms of the OS Architecture, Programming Model, Scheduling, Memory Management and Protection, Communication Protocols, Resource Sharing, Support for Real-Time Applications, and additional features.
result	9 These features are surveyed for both real-time and non-real-time WSN operating systems.

background	1 Biham and Kocher demonstrated that the PKZIP stream cipher was weak and presented an attack requiring thirteen bytes of plaintext.
background	2 The deflate algorithm “zippers” now use to compress the plaintext before encryption makes it difficult to get known plaintext.
method	3 We consider the problem of reducing the amount of known plaintext by finding other ways to filter key guesses.
method	4 In most cases we can reduce the amount of known plaintext from the archived file to two or three bytes, depending on the zipper used and the number of files in the archive.
method	5 For the most popular zippers on the Internet, there is a fast attack that does not require any information about the files in the archive; instead, it gets doubly-encrypted plaintext by exploiting a weakness in the pseudorandom-number generator.

background	1 The negative consequences of cyberbullying are becoming more alarming every day and technical solutions that allow for taking appropriate action by means of automated detection are still very limited.
background	2 Up until now, studies on cyberbullying detection have focused on individual comments only, disregarding context such as users’ characteristics and profile information.
method	3 In this paper we show that taking user context into account improves the detection of cyberbullying.

background	1 The 1990s saw the emergence of cognitive models that depend on very high dimensionality and randomness.
background	2 They include Holographic Reduced Representations, Spatter Code, Semantic Vectors, Latent Semantic Analysis, Context-Dependent Thinning, and Vector-Symbolic Architecture.
objective	3 They represent things in high-dimensional vectors that are manipulated by operations that produce new high-dimensional vectors in the style of traditional computing, in what is called here hyperdimensional computing on account of the very high dimensionality.
method	4 The paper presents the main ideas behind these models, written as a tutorial essay in hopes of making the ideas accessible and even provocative.
method	5 A sketch of how we have arrived at these models, with references and pointers to further reading, is given at the end.
result	6 The thesis of the paper is that hyperdimensional representation has much to offer to students of cognitive science, theoretical neuroscience, computer science and engineering, and mathematics.

background	1 A new, simple, and symmetric algorithm can be implemented that results in higher levels of detail in solid objects than previously possible with autostereograms.
background	2 In a stereoscope, an optical instrument similar to binoculars, each eye views a different picture and thereby receives the specific image that would have arisen naturally.
background	3 An early suggestion for a color stereo computer display involved a rotating filter wheel held in front of the eyes.
method	4 In contrast, this article describes a method for viewing on paper or on an ordinary computer screen without special equipment, although it is limited to the display of 3D monochromatic objects.
method	5 (The image can be colored, say, for artistic reasons, but the method we describe does not allow colors to be allocated in a way that corresponds to an arbitrary coloring of the solid object depicted.)
result	6 The image can easily be constructed by computer from any 3D scene or solid object description.<<ETX>>

background	1 This paper presents a simulated memristor crossbar implementation of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
background	2 In the past few years deep neural networks implemented on GPU clusters have become the state of the art in image classification.
background	3 They provide excellent classification ability at the cost of a more complex data manipulation process.
method	4 However once these systems are trained, we show that the analog crossbar circuits in this paper can highly parallelize the recognition phase of a CNN algorithm.
method	5 One of the drawbacks of using memristors to carry out computations is that the data stored will likely have less precision when compared to typical 32-bit floating point memory.
method	6 However, we show the proposed system is capable of operating with zero loss in classification accuracy if the memristors utilized are able to store at least 16 unique values (essentially acting as 4-bit devices).
result	7 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a memristor based circuit for implementing CNN recognition.
result	8 This is also the first paper that provides a circuit for precise memristor based analog convolution.

method	1 We introduce a novel technique for knowledge transfer, where knowledge from a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) is distilled and transferred to another DNN.
method	2 As the DNN performs a mapping from the input space to the output space through many layers sequentially, we define the distilled knowledge to be transferred in terms of flow between layers, which is calculated by computing the inner product between features from two layers.
method	3 When we compare the student DNN and the original network with the same size as the student DNN but trained without a teacher network, the proposed method of transferring the distilled knowledge as the flow between two layers exhibits three important phenomena: (1) the student DNN that learns the distilled knowledge is optimized much faster than the original model, (2) the student DNN outperforms the original DNN, and (3) the student DNN can learn the distilled knowledge from a teacher DNN that is trained at a different task, and the student DNN outperforms the original DNN that is trained from scratch.

background	1 We propose the use of dimensionality reduction as a defense against evasion attacks on ML classifiers.
background	2 We present and investigate a strategy for incorporating dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis to enhance the resilience of machine learning, targeting both the classification and the training phase.
result	3 We empirically evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of dimensionality reduction of data as a defense mechanism against evasion attacks using multiple real-world datasets.
result	4 Our key findings are that the defenses are (i) effective against strategic evasion attacks in the literature, increasing the resources required by an adversary for a successful attack by a factor of about two, (ii) applicable across a range of ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, and (iii) generalizable to multiple application domains, including image classification, and human activity classification.

objective	1 In this paper we critically review task analysis models and techniques.
result	2 These approaches to task analysis are discussed in order to develop a richer picture of human activity, while analyzing their limitations, general weaknesses, and possibilities for improvement.
method	3 We consider their ability to determine the appropriate set of atomic actions in a task, their effect on workers’ motivational needs, their support of users’ cognitive and sociocultural processes, and their effectiveness in supporting interface design.
result	4 We note that the major approaches have focused on very different levels of analysis, and call for greater integration of these different levels in task analysis theory.

background	1 The exponential growth and availability of data in all forms is the main booster to the continuing evolution in the communications industry.
background	2 The popularization of traffic-intensive applications including high definition video, 3-D visualization, augmented reality, wearable devices, and cloud computing defines a new era of mobile communications.

background	1 Lane detection is to detect lanes on the road and provide the accurate location and shape of each lane.
background	2 It severs as one of the key techniques to enable modern assisted and autonomous driving systems.
method	3 However, several unique properties of lanes challenge the detection methods.
method	4 The lack of distinctive features makes lane detection algorithms tend to be confused by other objects with similar local appearance.
method	5 Moreover, the inconsistent number of lanes on a road as well as diverse lane line patterns, e.g. solid, broken, single, double, merging, and splitting lines further hamper the performance.
method	6 In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based method, named LaneNet, to break down the lane detection into two stages: lane edge proposal and lane line localization.
method	7 Stage one uses a lane edge proposal network for pixel-wise lane edge classification, and the lane line localization network in stage two then detects lane lines based on lane edge proposals.
method	8 Please note that the goal of our LaneNet is built to detect lane line only, which introduces more difficulties on suppressing the false detections on the similar lane marks on the road like arrows and characters.
method	9 Despite all the difficulties, our lane detection is shown to be robust to both highway and urban road scenarios method without relying on any assumptions on the lane number or the lane line patterns.
result	10 The high running speed and low computational cost endow our LaneNet the capability of being deployed on vehicle-based systems.

background	1 Generative models, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs), have gained significant attention in recent years.
background	2 A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications.
background	3 Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task.
background	4 While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison.
background	5 As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field.
objective	6 In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 24 quantitative and 5 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models.

background	1 Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the notoriously difficult problem known as “the curse of dimensionality”.
objective	2 This paper presents a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs.
background	3 To this end, the PDEs are reformulated as a control theory problem and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function.
result	4 Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and speed.
result	5 This opens up new possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their inter-relationships.

background	1 The results of application of multichannel Kalman filtering to reduction of uncorrelated noise in magnetotelluric recordings are discussed in this article.

result	4 The practical examples of Kalman filter application to the real 2D and 3D data illustrate the merits of presented technique.

background	1 We consider the effect of imperfect separability in the received signals on the detection performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar with widely separated antennas.
background	2 The mutual orthogonality among the received signals is often assumed but cannot be achieved in practice for all Doppler and delay pairs.
method	3 We introduce a data model considering the correlation among the data from different transmitter-receiver pairs as unknown parameters.
method	4 Based on the expectation maximization algorithm, we propose a method to estimate the target, correlation, and noise parameters.
method	5 We then use the estimates of these parameters to develop a statistical decision test.
method	6 Employing the asymptotic statistical characteristics and the numerical performance of the test, we analyze the sensitivity of the MIMO radar with respect to changes in the cross-correlation levels of the measurements.
objective	7 We demonstrate the effect of the increase in the correlation among the received signals from different transmitters on the detection performance.

background	1 Interest in human-robot coexistence, in which humans and robots share a common work volume, is increasing in manufacturing environments.
background	2 Efficient work coordination requires both awareness of the human pose and a plan of action for both human and robot agents in order to compute robot motion trajectories that synchronize naturally with human motion.
objective	3 In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that synthesizes anticipatory knowledge of both human motions and subsequent action steps in order to predict in real-time the intended target of a human performing a reaching motion.
method	4 Motion-level anticipatory models are constructed using multiple demonstrations of human reaching motions.
method	5 We produce a library of motions from human demonstrations, based on a statistical representation of the degrees of freedom of the human arm, using time series analysis, wherein each time step is encoded as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
method	6 We demonstrate the benefits of this approach through offline statistical analysis of human motion data.
result	7 The results indicate a considerable improvement over prior techniques in early prediction, achieving 70% or higher correct classification on average for the first third of the trajectory (<; 500msec).
method	8 We also indicate proof-of-concept through the demonstration of a human-robot cooperative manipulation task performed with a PR2 robot.
background	9 Finally, we analyze the quality of task-level anticipatory knowledge required to improve prediction performance early in the human motion trajectory.

background	1 Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest.
background	2 Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events.
background	3 Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments.
background	4 Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research.
background	5 Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA).
background	6 The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company.
objective	7 Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis.
method	8 The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets.
objective	9 In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets.
method	10 In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase.

background	1 Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era.
background	2 In the past Richard Watson was the accepting senior editor for this paper.
method	3 MISQ Review articles survey, conceptualize, and synthesize prior MIS research and set directions for future research.
other	4 For more details see http://www.misq.org/misreview/announce.html few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource.
result	5 Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS).
method	6 The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations.
result	7 Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts.
result	8 Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich

background	1 Even the support vector machine (SVM) has been proposed to provide a good generalization performance, the classification result of the practically implemented SVM is often far from the theoretically expected level because their implementations are based on the approximated algorithms due to the high complexity of time and space.
method	2 To improve the limited classification performance of the real SVM, we propose to use the SVM ensembles with bagging (bootstrap aggregating).
method	3 Each individual SVM is trained independently using the randomly chosen training samples via a bootstrap technique.
method	4 Then, they are aggregated into to make a collective decision in several ways such as the majority voting, the LSE(least squares estimation)-based weighting, and the double-layer hierarchical combining.
result	5 Various simulation results for the IRIS data classification and the hand-written digit recognitionshow that the proposed SVM ensembles with bagging outperforms a single SVM in terms of classification accuracy greatly.

background	1 Most pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) scale poorly to massively parallel high-performance computation because they are designed as sequentially dependent state transformations.
background	2 We demonstrate that independent, keyed transformations of counters produce a large alternative class of PRNGs with excellent statistical properties (long period, no discernable structure or correlation).
method	3 These counter-based PRNGs are ideally suited to modern multi-core CPUs, GPUs, clusters, and special-purpose hardware because they vectorize and parallelize well, and require little or no memory for state.
method	4 We introduce several counter-based PRNGs: some based on cryptographic standards (AES, Threefish) and some completely new (Philox).
result	5 All our PRNGs pass rigorous statistical tests (including TestU01's BigCrush) and produce at least 264 unique parallel streams of random numbers, each with period 2128 or more.
result	6 In addition to essentially unlimited parallel scalability, our PRNGs offer excellent single-chip performance: Philox is faster than the CURAND library on a single NVIDIA GPU.

background	1 In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in mining time series databases.
background	2 As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions.
background	3 One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation.
method	4 This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time series data.
method	5 A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times.
objective	6 In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques.
result	7 We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data mining perspective.
result	8 We introduce a novel algorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature.

background	1 The energy consumption rate for sensors in a wireless sensor network vary greatly depending on the protocols the sensors use for communication.
objective	2 The gossip-based sleep protocol (GSP) (X. Hou et al., 2004) is an example of a protocol that implements routing and some MAC functions in an effort to conserve energy.
background	3 Simulations show that GSP can conserve energy.
background	4 We expand on this effort by building a prototype system and measuring energy consumption rates.
background	5 GSP was implemented on the Mica2 platform and measurements were conducted to determine energy consumption.
method	6 The measurements were then used to build an energy consumption model for GSP

background	1 The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain.
background	2 Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models.
background	3 Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing.
background	4 However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective.
background	5 The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level.
background	6 Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth.
objective	7 This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications.
objective	8 It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.

background	1 We present a novel clustering algorithm for tagging a face dataset (e. g., a personal photo album).
result	2 The core of the algorithm is a new dissimilarity, called Rank-Order distance, which measures the dissimilarity between two faces using their neighboring information in the dataset.
method	3 The Rank-Order distance is motivated by an observation that faces of the same person usually share their top neighbors.
method	4 Specifically, for each face, we generate a ranking order list by sorting all other faces in the dataset by absolute distance (e. g., L1 or L2 distance between extracted face recognition features).
method	5 Then, the Rank-Order distance of two faces is calculated using their ranking orders.
method	6 Using the new distance, a Rank-Order distance based clustering algorithm is designed to iteratively group all faces into a small number of clusters for effective tagging.
result	7 The proposed algorithm outperforms competitive clustering algorithms in term of both precision/recall and efficiency.

background	1 A large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature.
background	2 Common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions.
background	3 The ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties.
method	4 This paper presents the first PnP solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm.
method	5 We compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central PnP algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency.
result	6 Our algorithm is called Unified PnP (UPnP).

background	1 We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image.
background	2 Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose.
method	3 Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly.
method	4 In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems.
method	5 For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms.
result	6 Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.

background	1 Mining information and knowledge from large databases has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning, and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues.
background	2 Researchers in many di erent elds have shown great interest in data mining.

background	1 A document image is composed of a variety of physical entities or regions such as text blocks, lines, words, figures, tables, and background.
background	2 We could also assign functional or logical labels such as sentences, titles, captions, author names, and addresses to some of these regions.
method	3 The process of document structure and layout analysis tries to decompose a given document image into its component regions and understand their functional roles and relationships.
method	4 The processing is carried out in multiple steps, such as preprocessing, page decomposition, structure understanding, etc.
objective	5 We will look into each of these steps in detail in the following sections.
method	6 Document images are often generated from physical documents by digitization using scanners or digital cameras.
result	7 Many documents, such as newspapers, magazines and brochures, contain very complex layout due to the placement of figures, titles, and captions, complex backgrounds, artistic text formatting, etc.

result	9 A human reader uses a variety of additional cues such as context, conventions and information about language/script, along with a complex reasoning process to decipher the contents of a document.
result	10 Automatic analysis of an arbitrary document with complex layout is an extremely difficult task and is beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art document structure and layout analysis systems.

background	1 Modern NAND flash memory chips provide high density by storing two bits of data in each flash cell, called a multi-level cell (MLC).
background	2 An MLC partitions the threshold voltage range of a flash cell into four voltage states.
background	3 When a flash cell is programmed, a high voltage is applied to the cell.
background	4 Due to parasitic capacitance coupling between flash cells that are physically close to each other, flash cell programming can lead to cell-to-cell program interference, which introduces errors into neighboring flash cells.
method	5 In order to reduce the impact of cell-to-cell interference on the reliability of MLC NAND flash memory, flash manufacturers adopt a two-step programming method, which programs the MLC in two separate steps.
method	6 First, the flash memory partially programs the least significant bit of the MLC to some intermediate threshold voltage.
result	7 Second, it programs the most significant bit to bring the MLC up to its full voltage state.
result	8 In this paper, we demonstrate that two-step programming exposes new reliability and security vulnerabilities.
method	9 We experimentally characterize the effects of two-step programming using contemporary 1X-nm (i.e., 15–19nm) flash memory chips.
result	10 We find that a partially-programmed flash cell (i.e., a cell where the second programming step has not yet been performed) is much more vulnerable to cell-to-cell interference and read disturb than a fully-programmed cell.

background	1 In many practical learning scenarios, there is a small amount of labeled data along with a large pool of unlabeled data.
background	2 Many supervised learning algorithms have been developed and extensively studied.
method	3 We present a new \co-training" strategy for using un-labeled data to improve the performance of standard supervised learning algorithms.
method	4 Unlike much of the prior work, such as the co-training procedure of Blum and Mitchell (1998), we do not assume there are two redundant views both of which are suucient for classiication.
method	5 The only requirement our co-training strategy places on each supervised learning algorithm is that its hypothesis partitions the example space into a set of equivalence classes (e.g. for a decision tree each leaf deenes an equivalence class).
result	6 We evaluate our co-training strategy via experiments using data from the UCI repository.

background	1 Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful.
background	2 Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function.
background	3 However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process.
method	4 To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator.
method	5 We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence.
background	6 There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs.
background	7 First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs.
background	8 Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process.
result	9 We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.
result	10 We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.

background	1 Our daily lives have been immersed in widespread location-based social networks (LBSNs).
background	2 As an open platform, LBSNs typically allow all kinds of users to register accounts.
background	3 Malicious attackers can easily join and post misleading information, often with the intention of influencing users' decisions in urban computing environments.
method	4 To provide reliable information and improve the experience for legitimate users, we design and implement DeepScan, a malicious account detection system for LBSNs.
method	5 Different from existing approaches, DeepScan leverages emerging deep learning technologies to learn users' dynamic behavior.
method	6 In particular, we introduce the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct time series analysis of user activities.
method	7 DeepScan combines newly introduced time series features and a set of conventional features extracted from user activities, and exploits a supervised machine-learning-based model for detection.
result	8 Using real traces collected from Dianping, a representative LBSN, we demonstrate that DeepScan can achieve excellent prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.964.
result	9 We also find that the time series features play a critical role in the detection system.

background	1 Introduction: While increased time spent on social media (TSSM) has been associated with depression and anxiety, the independent role of using multiple social media (SM) platforms is unclear.
method	2 Methods: We surveyed a nationally-representative sample of 1787 U.S. young adults ages 19e32.
method	3 Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).
result	4 We assessed use of multiple SM platforms with an adapted Pew Internet Research scale.
method	5 We used ordered logistic regression models to assess associations between use of multiple SM platforms and mental health outcomes while controlling for eight covariates, including overall TSSM.
result	6 Results: Compared to those who used 0e2 social media platforms, participants who used 7e11 social media platforms had substantially higher odds of having increased levels of both depression (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1⁄4 3.0, 95% CI 1⁄4 1.9e4.8) and anxiety symptoms (AOR 1⁄4 3.2, 95% CI 1⁄4 2.0e5.1).
result	7 Associations were linear (p < 0.001 for all) and robust to all sensitivity analyses.
result	8 Conclusions: Use of multiple SM platforms is independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, even when controlling for overall TSSM.
result	9 These associations are strong enough that it may be valuable for clinicians to ask individuals with depression and anxiety about multiple platform use and to counsel regarding this potential contributing factor.

background	1 Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation process.
background	2 The explanation of the relationship between model variables and outputs is easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions, thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical significance.
background	3 For “black box” models, such as random forest, this information is hidden inside the model structure.
background	4 This work presents an approach for computing feature contributions for random forest classification models.
objective	5 It allows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model prediction for an individual instance.
method	6 Interpretation of feature contributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the proposed methodology.
result	7 The robustness of results is demonstrated through an extensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of generated random forest models.

background	1 The Internet of Things is one of the most promising technological developments in information technology.
background	2 It promises huge financial and nonfinancial benefits across supply chains, in product life cycle and customer relationship applications as well as in smart environments.
background	3 However, the adoption process of the Internet of Things has been slower than expected.
background	4 One of the main reasons for this is the missing profitability for each individual stakeholder.
background	5 Costs and benefits are not equally distributed.
method	6 Cost benefit sharing models have been proposed to overcome this problem and to enable new areas of application.
method	7 However, these cost benefit sharing approaches are complex, time consuming, and have failed to achieve broad usage.
method	8 In this chapter, an alternative concept, suggesting flexible pricing and trading of information, is proposed.
method	9 On the basis of a beverage supply chain scenario, a prototype installation, based on an open source billing solution and the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS), is shown as a proof of concept and an introduction to different pricing options.
method	10 This approach allows a more flexible and scalable solution for cost benefit sharing and may enable new business models for the Internet of Things.

background	1 The after-sales activities are nowadays acknowledged as a relevant source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most manufacturing industries.
method	2 Top and middle management, therefore, should focus on the definition of a structured business performance measurement system for the after-sales business.
objective	3 In addition, since many actors are involved along the after-sale service supply chain, an integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be designed consistently at every level of the supply chain.
background	4 Nonetheless, little attention was devoted by scientific and managerial literature to this topic.
method	5 The paper aims at filling this gap, and proposes an integrated framework for the after-sales network performance measurement, and provides an empirical application to two automotive case companies and their official service network.
result	6 The cases show that performance measurement systems of different supply chain actors should be aligned in order to achieve strategic consistency.
result	7 In particular, the performance of different actors at the process level of the framework concurs in determining the after-sales service overall performance towards the final customer.
result	8 In addition, linkages at other levels (mainly the business and activity ones) may be needed or helpful in ensuring consistency between strategic and operational objectives, inside the organisations and thus for the whole supply chain.

objective	1 This paper proposes to use autoencoders with nonlinear dimensionality reduction in the anomaly detection task.
method	2 The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an autoencoder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA and kernel PCA to clarify its property.
method	3 The artificial data is generated from Lorenz system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data.
method	4 This paper demonstrates that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails.
method	5 Also, autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising autoenconders.
method	6 Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as nonlinear techniques without complex computation as kernel PCA requires.
result	7 Finaly, the authors examine the learned features in the hidden layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly and activate differently with anomalous input.

background	1 Reinforcement learning is an unsupervised machine learning method in the area of Artificial Intelligence.
background	2 It presents well performance in simulation of the thinking ability of human.
background	3 However, it needs a trial-and-error process to achieve the goal.
background	4 In the research field of game AI, it is a good approach to allow the non-player-characters (NPCs) of digital games to become more humanity.

background	1 Ties often have a strength naturally associated with them that differentiate them from each other.
background	2 Tie strength has been operationalized as weights.
objective	3 A few network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of node centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness.
objective	4 However, these generalizations have solely focused on tie weights, and not on the number of ties, which was the central component of the original measures.
objective	5 This paper proposes generalizations that combine both these aspects.
method	6 We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying one of them to Freeman’s EIES dataset.

background	1 Online taxicab platforms like DiDi and Uber have impacted hundreds of millions of users on their choices of traveling, but how do users feel about the ride-sharing services, and how to improve their experience?
background	2 While current ride-sharing services have collected massive travel data, it remains challenging to develop data-driven techniques for modeling and predicting user ride experience.
objective	3 In this work, we aim to accurately predict passenger satisfaction over their rides and understand the key factors that lead to good/bad experiences.
method	4 Based on in-depth analysis of large-scale travel data from a popular taxicab platform in China, we develop PHINE (Pattern-aware Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding) for data-driven user experience modeling.
method	5 Our PHINE framework is novel in that it is composed of spatial-temporal node binding and grouping for addressing the inherent data variation, and pattern preservation based joint training for modeling the interactions among drivers, passengers, locations, and time.
result	6 Extensive experiments on 12 real-world travel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PHINE over strong baseline methods.

background	1 3D sensors such as LIDARs, stereo cameras, time-of-flight cameras, and the Microsoft Kinect are increasingly found in a wide range of applications, including gaming, personal robotics, and space exploration.
background	2 In some cases, pattern recognition algorithms for processing depth images can be tested using actual sensors observing real-world objects.
background	3 In many situations, however, it is common to test new algorithms using computer-generated synthetic images, as such simulations tend to be faster, more flexible, and less expensive than hardware tests.

result	8 The software is written in C++, and is released under the open source BSD license.

background	1 This paper attempts to examine the effects of virtual team dimensions on social identities of its members.
method	2 A review of the literature shows that the geographically dispersed, culturally diverse as well as temporary dimensions of virtual teams do not match with their stability as members have different ethnic, social, or cultural backgrounds.
background	3 Sources like culture, place, and time seem to continuously acquire social identities.
method	4 Due to the importance of social identity, an attempt has been made to examine its influence on organizational variables (i.e. job satisfaction, job involvement, job commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior).
method	5 Questionnaire-based data have been accomplished from 149 members of 44 teams.
result	6 The hypothesized relationships among the proposed variables are tested via a structural equation model (SEM).
result	7 Results show that the geographically disperse and culturally diverse variables are negatively related to the social identity as against those of temporary and organizational variables which are related positively.

background	1 Automatic player detection, labeling and tracking in broadcast soccer video are significant while quite challenging tasks.
objective	2 In this paper, we present a solution to perform automatic multiple player detection, unsupervised labeling and efficient tracking.
background	3 Players’ position and scale are determined by a boosting based detector.
method	4 Players’ appearance models are unsupervised learned from hundreds of samples automatically collected by detection.
method	5 Thereafter, these models can be utilized for player labeling (Team A, Team B and Referee).
method	6 Player tracking is achieved by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) data association.
method	7 Some data driven dynamics are proposed to improve the Markov chain’s efficiency.
result	8 The testing results on FIFA World Cup 2006 video demonstrate that our method can reach high detection and labeling precision, and reliably tracking in cases of scenes such as multiple player occlusion, moderate camera motion and pose variation.

background	1 Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular tool for linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
background	2 Kernel PCA is the nonlinear form of PCA, which better exploits the complicated spatial structure of high-dimensional features.
objective	3 In this paper, we first review the basic ideas of PCA and kernel PCA.
method	4 Then we focus on the reconstruction of pre-images for kernel PCA.
method	5 We also give an introduction on how PCA is used in active shape models (ASMs), and discuss how kernel PCA can be applied to improve traditional ASMs.
method	6 Then we show some experimental results to compare the performance of kernel PCA and standard PCA for classification problems.
method	7 We also implement the kernel PCA-based ASMs, and use it to construct human face models.

background	1 While favouring communications and easing information sharing, Social Network Sites are also used to launch harmful campaigns against specific groups and individuals.
background	2 Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives.
background	3 Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence.
objective	4 In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns.
objective	5 Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages.
method	6 We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate.
method	7 Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy.
method	8 Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
method	9 We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition.
result	10 The results show the effectiveness of the two classification approaches tested over the first manually annotated Italian Hate Speech Corpus of social media text.

background	1 Marketing experts consider the mobile device as an extremely promising marketing tool as it supports them to cope with their major challenge: getting time and attention from customers.
background	2 Current mobile marketing research mostly covers success factors and acceptance analysis.
background	3 Categorization, when addressed, lacks in appropriate foundation and is not linked to objectives at all.

result	5 The outcome of the paper is the derivation of four mobile marketing standard types and an examination of campaign objectives that can be addressed by mobile marketing.
result	6 The proposed scheme allows to unambiguously characterize any given mobile marketing campaign and to identify the respective objectives.

background	1 In recent years two main platforms emerged as powerful key players in the domain of parallel computing: GPUs and FPGAs.
background	2 Many researches investigate interaction and benefits of coupling them with a general purpose processor (CPU), but very few, and only very recently, integrate the two in the same computational system.
background	3 Even less research are focusing on direct interaction of the two platforms [1].
objective	4 This paper presents an open source framework enabling easy integration of GPU and FPGA resources; Our work provides direct data transfer between the two platforms with minimal CPU coordination at high data rate and low latency.
objective	5 Finally, at the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposition of an open source implementation of a system including an FPGA and a GPU that provides code for both sides.
method	6 Notwithstanding the generality of the presented framework, we present in this paper an actual implementation consisting of a single GPU board and a FPGA board connected through a PCIe link.
result	7 Measures on this implementation demonstrate achieved data rate that are close to the theoretical maximum.

background	1 Instagram is a popular social networking application, which allows photo-sharing and applying different photo filters to adjust the appearance of a picture.
background	2 By applying photo filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience.
objective	3 In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users take pictures and apply filters to them.
method	4 To investigate this relationship, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API.
result	5 Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits.
result	6 Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and the way users want to make their pictures look.
result	7 This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.

background	1 In this work we investigate building indoor location based applications for a mobile augmented reality system.
background	2 We believe that augmented reality is a natural interface to visualize spacial information such as position or direction of locations and objects for location based applications that process and present information based on the user’s position in the real world.
method	3 To enable such applications we construct an indoor tracking system that covers a substantial part of a building.
objective	4 It is based on visual tracking of fiducial markers enhanced with an inertial sensor for fast rotational updates.
objective	5 To scale such a system to a whole building we introduce a space partitioning scheme to reuse fiducial markers throughout the environment.
result	6 Finally we demonstrate two location based applications built upon this facility, an indoor navigation aid and a library search applica-

objective	1 Through an empirical study among holiday travellers, residing in the Former Soviet Union Republics, this paper presents a comprehensive view of role and impact of social media on the whole holiday travel planning process: Before, during and after the trip, providing insights on usage levels, scope of use, level of influence and trust.
result	2 Findings suggest that social media are predominantly used after holidays for experience sharing.
method	3 It is also shown that there is a strong correlation between perceived level of influence from social media and changes made in holiday plans prior to final decisions.
result	4 Moreover, it is revealed that user-generated content is perceived as more trustworthy when compared to official tourism websites, travel agents and mass media advertising.

background	1 This paper provides new results for the tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
background	2 The UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts, that are used to control the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and to achieve asymptotic tracking of four outputs, namely, three position variables for the vehicle center of mass and the direction of one vehicle body-fixed axis.
background	3 A globally defined model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics is introduced as a basis for the analysis.
method	4 A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group SE(3) and it is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global.
result	5 Several numerical examples, including an example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down, illustrate the versatility of the controller.

background	1 We consider the problem of learning a sparse multi-task regression, where the structure in the outputs can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as outputs and internal nodes as clusters of the outputs at multiple granularity.
objective	2 Our goal is to recover the common set of relevant inputs for each output cluster.
background	3 Assuming that the tree structure is available as prior knowledge, we formulate this problem as a new multi-task regularized regression called tree-guided group lasso.
method	4 Our structured regularization is based on a grouplasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure.
method	5 We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap.
method	6 We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a largescale problem.
result	7 Using simulated and yeast datasets, we demonstrate that our method shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of true sparsity patterns compared to other methods for multi-task learning.

background	1 While software is so important for all facets of the modern world, software development itself is not a perfect process.
method	2 Agile software engineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way of developing software as compared to the traditional methodologies.
result	3 However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in this subject is still scant in the academic circles.
method	4 This research study was a survey study on the critical success factors of Agile software development projects using quantitative approach.
method	5 Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential critical success factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled.
objective	6 Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted to consolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possible critical success factors for each of the four project success categories – Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost.
method	7 A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey data from 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world.
result	8 Multiple regression techniques were used, both at the full regression model and at the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure.
result	9 The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported, identifying three critical success factors for Agile software development projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile Software Engineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.
result	10 Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations for practitioners.

background	1 In this work, we present a minimal neural model for constituency parsing based on independent scoring of labels and spans.
objective	2 We show that this model is not only compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of the input.
method	3 We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).

background	1 Autonomous vehicles capable of navigating unpredictable real-world environments with little human feedback are a reality today.
background	2 Such systems rely heavily on onboard sensors such as cameras, radar/LIDAR, and GPS as well as capabilities such as 3G/4G connectivity and V2V/V2I communication to make real-time maneuvering decisions.
background	3 Autonomous vehicle control imposes very strict requirements on the security of the communication channels used by the vehicle to exchange information as well as the control logic that performs complex driving tasks such as adapting vehicle velocity or changing lanes.
objective	4 This study presents a first look at the effects of security attacks on the communication channel as well as sensor tampering of a connected vehicle stream equipped to achieve CACC.
result	5 Our simulation results show that an insider attack can cause significant instability in the CACC vehicle stream.
result	6 We also illustrate how different countermeasures, such as downgrading to ACC mode, could potentially be used to improve the security and safety of the connected vehicle streams.

background	1 This paper presents a wall-climbing robot which adopts passive suction cups as the attaching components.
background	2 Using only one motor, this robot can not only move on a wall but also attach suction cups to the wall and remove them from the wall.
background	3 Passive suction cups do not consume additional energy to keep adhesion.
objective	4 Therefore, the proposed robot can realize the climbing motion on a wall with relatively low energy consumption.
method	5 The prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested.
result	6 The experiments showed that the proposed robot could attach and remove suction cups passively.
result	7 However, the robot could not move up the wall well and fell down often.
result	8 In order to solve this problem, the load of each suction cup when attached to a vertical wall is analyzed.
result	9 As a result, it is shown that a moment generated by both of the gravity and the attaching force of suction cups turns the robot down from the wall.
result	10 Then a new model which improves the falling problems is thus designed.

background	1 There is an ongoing debate over the activities of brands and companies in social media.
background	2 Some researchers believe social media provide a unique opportunity for brands to foster their relationships with customers, while others believe the contrary.
objective	3 Taking the perspective of the brand community building plus the brand trust and loyalty literatures, our goal is to show how brand communities based on social media influence elements of the customer centric model (i.e., the relationships among focal customer and brand, product, company, and other customers) and brand loyalty.
method	4 A survey-based empirical study with 441 respondents was conducted.
result	5 The results of structural equation modeling show that brand communities established on social media have positive effects on customer/product, customer/brand, customer/company and customer/other customers relationships, which in turn have positive effects on brand trust, and trust has positive effects on brand loyalty.
method	6 We find that brand trust has a fully mediating role in converting the effects of enhanced relationships in brand community to brand loyalty.
result	7 The implications for marketing practice and future research are discussed.

background	1 Imagine that you get such certain awesome experience and knowledge by only reading a book.
other	2 How can?
objective	3 It seems to be greater when a book can be the best thing to discover.
result	4 Books now will appear in printed and soft file collection.
method	5 One of them is this book business process management concepts languages architectures.
other	6 It is so usual with the printed books.
result	7 However, many people sometimes have no space to bring the book for them; this is why they can't read the book wherever they want.

background	1 Process discovery—discovering a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log—is one of the most challenging tasks in process mining.
background	2 The primary reason is that conventional modeling languages (e.g., Petri nets, BPMN, EPCs, and ULM ADs) have difficulties representing the observed behavior properly and/or succinctly.
background	3 Moreover, discovered process models tend to have deadlocks and livelocks.
objective	4 Therefore, we advocate a new representation more suitable for process discovery: causal nets.
method	5 Causal nets are related to the representations used by several process discovery techniques (e.g., heuristic mining, fuzzy mining, and genetic mining).
method	6 However, unlike existing approaches, we provide declarative semantics more suitable for process mining.
method	7 To clarify these semantics and to illustrate the non-local nature of this new representation, we relate causal nets to Petri nets.

objective	1 The main objective of this research was to identify factors that affected worker productivity, occupational health and safety in selected industries in a developing country.
background	2 Fifty production managers participated in the study.
background	3 Fifty-four percent of the managers reported hot environmental conditions, 28% a noisy environment, and 26% a lack of resources and facilities.
method	4 Managers received worker complaints of fatigue, back pain, upper-body pain, hand and wrist pain and headaches.
result	5 Management (88%) acknowledged not having knowledge or access to ergonomics information.
result	6 Ninety-four percent of the companies did not carry out ergonomic assessments.
result	7 A significant correlation ðp , 0:01Þ was found among productivity indicators and health and organizational attributes.
result	8 Lack of skills in ergonomics and training, communication and resources are believed to be some of the factors contributing to the poor ergonomic conditions and consequent loss of worker productivity and reduced health and safety in these industries.

background	1 Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous networks that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain.
background	2 However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources.
method	3 We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data.
method	4 Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global signal.
method	5 The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity.
method	6 We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented fcMRI measures.
result	7 The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures.

background	1 Despite their massivesize, successful deep artificial neural networkscan exhibit a remarkably small differencebetween training and test performance.
background	2 Conventional wisdom attributessmall generalization error either to propertiesof themodel family, or to the regularization techniquesused during training.
objective	3 Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice.
method	4 Specifically, our experimentsestablish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data.
method	5 This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise.
result	6 We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simpledepth two neural networksalready haveperfect finitesampleexpressivity assoon as thenumber of parameters exceeds thenumber of datapointsas it usually does in practice.
result	7 We interpret our experimental findingsby comparison with traditional models.

background	1 Due to the increasing threat from malicious software (malware), monitoring of vulnerable systems is becoming increasingly important.
background	2 The need to log and analyze activity encompasses networks, individual computers, as well as mobile devices.
background	3 While there are various automatic approaches and techniques available to detect, identify, or capture malware, the actual analysis of the ever-increasing number of suspicious samples is a time-consuming process for malware analysts.
method	4 The use of visualization and highly interactive visual analytics systems can help to support this analysis process with respect to investigation, comparison, and summarization of malware samples.
background	5 Currently, there is no survey available that reviews available visualization systems supporting this important and emerging field.
objective	6 We provide a systematic overview and categorization of malware visualization systems from the perspective of visual analytics.
result	7 Additionally, we identify and evaluate data providers and commercial tools that produce meaningful input data for the reviewed malware visualization systems.
result	8 This helps to reveal data types that are currently underrepresented, enabling new research opportunities in the visualization community.

background	1 Building robust low and mid-level image representations, beyond edge primitives, is a long-standing goal in vision.
background	2 Many existing feature detectors spatially pool edge information which destroys cues such as edge intersections, parallelism and symmetry.
objective	3 We present a learning framework where features that capture these mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data.
method	4 Our approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under a spar-sity constraint and is totally unsupervised.
objective	5 By building a hierarchy of such decompositions we can learn rich feature sets that are a robust image representation for both the analysis and synthesis of images.

background	1 We have analyzed the properties of the HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color space with emphasis on the visual perception of the variation in Hue, Saturation and Intensity values of an image pixel.
method	2 We extract pixel features by either choosing the Hue or the Intensity as the dominant property based on the Saturation value of a pixel.
method	3 The feature extraction method has been applied for both image segmentation as well as histogram generation applications – two distinct approaches to content based image retrieval (CBIR).
method	4 Segmentation using this method shows better identification of objects in an image.
method	5 The histogram retains a uniform color transition that enables us to do a window-based smoothing during retrieval.
result	6 The results have been compared with those generated using the RGB color space.

background	1 We extend the capabilities of neural networks by coupling them to external memory resources, which they can interact with by attentional processes.
objective	2 The combined system is analogous to a Turing Machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable end-toend, allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent.
result	3 Preliminary results demonstrate that Neural Turing Machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples.

background	1 Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation.
background	2 This article investigates how content producers navigate ‘imagined audiences’ on Twitter.
method	3 We talked with participants who have different types of followings to understand their techniques, including targeting different audiences, concealing subjects, and maintaining authenticity.
background	4 Some techniques of audience management resemble the practices of ‘micro-celebrity’ and personal branding, both strategic self-commodification.
result	5 Our model of the networked audience assumes a manyto-many communication through which individuals conceptualize an imagined audience evoked through their tweets.

objective	1 The accurate modeling of micro-grid access to power system planning and design stage needs is the primary problem to solve.
method	2 This paper modeled the micro grid photovoltaic power generation system ,including silicon solar cell, photovoltaic inverters, battery energy storage system, and the micro power distribution system .The use of power system analysis software (DIGSILENT) of actual power system simulation, the simulation results verify the model's correctness.
result	3 In the power grid fault disturbance, the light intensity of disturbance and the load disturbances, the simulation results show that the optical storage combined with micro network has fast dynamic response characteristics, and its network of grid-connected voltage influenced by the changes of the light and load is little, while more affected by the network fault influence.

background	1 Accurate state estimation for a mobile robot often requires the fusion of data from multiple sensors.
background	2 Software that performs sensor fusion should therefore support the inclusion of a wide array of heterogeneous sensors.
method	3 This paper presents a software package, robot_localization, for the Robot Operating System (ROS).
method	4 The package currently contains an implementation of an extended Kalman filter (EKF).
result	5 It can support an unlimited number of inputs from multiple sensor types, and allows users to customize which sensor data fields are fused with the current state estimate.
result	6 In this work, we motivate our design decisions, discuss implementation details, and provide results from real-world tests.

background	1 The ICP algorithm is accurate and fast for registration between two point sets in a same scale, but it doesn't handle the case with different scales.
objective	2 This paper instead introduces a novel approach named the scaling iterative closest point (SICP) algorithm which integrates a scale matrix with boundaries into the original ICP algorithm for scaling registration.
method	3 This method uses a simple iterative algorithm with the SVD algorithm and the properties of parabola incorporated to compute the translation, rotation and scale transformations at each iterative step, and its convergence is rapid with only a few iterations.
method	4 The SICP algorithm is independent of shape representation and feature extraction; thereby it is general for scaling registration.
result	5 Experimental results demonstrate its robustness and fast speed compared with the standard ICP algorithm.

background	1 Fractional calculus has recently attracted much attention in the literature.
background	2 In particular, fractional derivatives are widely discussed and applied in many areas.

method	5 Some numerical examples are also presented.

background	1 Most of current computer-based facial expression analysis methods focus on the recognition of perfectly posed expressions, and hence are incapable of handling the individuals with expression impairments.
background	2 In particular, patients with schizophrenia usually have impaired expressions in the form of "flat" or "inappropriate" affects, which make the quantification of their facial expressions a challenging problem.
method	3 This paper presents methods to quantify the group differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, by extracting specialized features and analyzing group differences on a feature manifold.
method	4 The features include 2D and 3D geometric features, and the moment invariants combining both 3D geometry and 2D textures.
result	5 Facial expression recognition experiments on actors demonstrate that our combined features can better characterize facial expressions than either 2D geometric or texture features.
result	6 The features are then embedded into an ISOMAP manifold to quantify the group differences between controls and patients.
result	7 Experiments show that our results are strongly supported by the human rating results and clinical findings, thus providing a framework that is able to quantify the abnormality in patients with schizophrenia.

background	1 Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data.
background	2 In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units.
background	3 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks.
background	4 However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited.
method	5 This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems.
result	6 An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.

background	1 Top-performing deep architectures are trained on massive amounts of labeled data.
background	2 In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available.
background	3 Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled targetdomain data is necessary).
method	4 As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of “deep” features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains.
result	5 We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer.
method	6 The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation.
result	7 Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages.
result	8 The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-ofthe-art on Office datasets.

result	6 First implementations were based on single UAV, later the potential of multiple UAVs collaborating in a team was noticed.
result	7 Many applications were implemented in distributed manner, using multiple collaborative UAVs and the distributed processing systems principles.
method	8 In this paper we survey the applications implemented over cooperative teams of UAVs that operate as distributed processing systems.

background	1 Real-world case studies are important to complement the academic skills and knowledge acquired by computer science students.
background	2 In this paper we relate our experiences with a course specifically designed to address this issue.
background	3 The problem to be addressed is the replacement of a Hospital Information System in a large regional hospital.
method	4 The case mimics as close as possible the project as it really took place.
objective	5 The objectives of the course are threefold: to train management and communication skills, to integrate and apply knowledge gained at different previous courses, and to learn by experience the difference between a real-world problem and a textbook problem.
result	6 Students’ evaluations show that the objectives of the course are met and that it is regarded as very useful.
result	7 We found that the three objectives mutually reinforce each other, which is a decisive factor for the success of the course.

background	1 The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a modern approach where boundaries between real and digital domains are progressively eliminated by changing over consistently every physical device to smart object ready to provide valuable services.
background	2 These services provide a vital role in different life domains but at the same time create new challenges particularly in security and privacy.
background	3 Authentication and access control models are considered as the essential elements to address these security and privacy challenges.
background	4 Risk-based access control model is one of the dynamic access control models that provides more flexibility in accessing system resources.
method	5 This model performs a risk analysis to estimate the security risk associated with each access request and uses the estimated risk to make the access decision.
method	6 One of the essential elements in this model is the risk estimation process.
method	7 Estimating risk is a complex operation that requires the consideration of a variety of factors in the access control environment.

background	1 Decision Tree Classifiers (DTC's) are used successfully in many diverse areas such as radar signal classification, character recognition, remote sensing, medical diagnosis, expert systems, and speech recognition, to name only a few.
background	2 Perhaps, the most important feature of DTC's is their capability to break down a complex decision-making process into a collection of simpler decisions, thus providing a solution which is often easier to interpret.

objective	1 This paper describes a visual odometry algorithm for estimating frame-to-frame camera motion from successive stereo image pairs.
method	2 The algorithm differs from most visual odometry algorithms in two key respects: (1) it makes no prior assumptions about camera motion, and (2) it operates on dense disparity images computed by a separate stereo algorithm.
method	3 This algorithm has been tested on many platforms, including wheeled and legged vehicles, and has proven to be fast, accurate and robust.

background	1 The phenomenon of digital transformation received some attention in previous literature concerning industries such as media, entertainment and publishing.
background	2 However, there is a lack of understanding about digital transformation of primarily physical industries, whose products cannot be completely digitized, e.g., automotive industry.
method	3 We conducted a rigorous content analysis of substantial secondary data from industry magazines aiming to generate insights to this phenomenon in the automotive industry.
background	4 We examined the impact of major digital trends on dominant business models.

background	1 Smartphones have exploded in popularity in recent years, becoming ever more sophisticated and capable.
background	2 As a result, developers worldwide are building increasingly complex applications that require ever increasing amounts of computational power and energy.
objective	3 In this paper we propose ThinkAir, a framework that makes it simple for developers to migrate their smartphone applications to the cloud.
objective	4 ThinkAir exploits the concept of smartphone virtualization in the cloud and provides method-level computation offloading.
objective	5 Advancing on previous work, it focuses on the elasticity and scalability of the cloud and enhances the power of mobile cloud computing by parallelizing method execution using multiple virtual machine (VM) images.
method	6 We implement ThinkAir and evaluate it with a range of benchmarks starting from simple micro-benchmarks to more complex applications.
method	7 First, we show that the execution time and energy consumption decrease two orders of magnitude for a N-queens puzzle application and one order of magnitude for a face detection and a virus scan application.
method	8 We then show that a parallelizable application can invoke multiple VMs to execute in the cloud in a seamless and on-demand manner such as to achieve greater reduction on execution time and energy consumption.
method	9 We finally use a memory-hungry image combiner tool to demonstrate that applications can dynamically request VMs with more computational power in order to meet their computational requirements.

background	1 Human being is the most intelligent animal in this world.
background	2 Intuitively, optimization algorithm inspired by human being creative problem solving process should be superior to the optimization algorithms inspired by collective behavior of insects like ants, bee, etc.
objective	3 In this paper, we introduce a novel brain storm optimization algorithm, which was inspired by the human brainstorming process.
method	4 Two benchmark functions were tested to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.

objective	1 The field of object detection has made significant advances riding on the wave of region-based ConvNets, but their training procedure still includes many heuristics and hyperparameters that are costly to tune.
objective	2 We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors.
objective	3 Our motivation is the same as it has always been - detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples.
objective	4 Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient.
result	5 OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use.
result	6 But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.
result	7 Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset.
result	8 Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.

background	1 We describe the design and use of the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, an extensible pipeline that provides core natural language analysis.
background	2 This toolkit is quite widely used, both in the research NLP community and also among commercial and government users of open source NLP technology.
method	3 We suggest that this follows from a simple, approachable design, straightforward interfaces, the inclusion of robust and good quality analysis components, and not requiring use of a large amount of associated baggage.

background	1 This paper describes a simple, efficient algorithm to locate all occurrences of any of a finite number of keywords in a string of text.
objective	2 The algorithm consists of constructing a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using the pattern matching machine to process the text string in a single pass.
method	3 Construction of the pattern matching machine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords.
background	4 The number of state transitions made by the pattern matching machine in processing the text string is independent of the number of keywords.

objective	1 This paper discusses the need to consider possible risks to ensure business survival and business continuity before the implementation of new technologies, with specific interest to wireless networks and wireless devices.
background	2 Information Technology is fast becoming essential within business processes and is considered a technical issue yet neglected at board level.
background	3 In recent years, there has been an elevated awareness in Information Security and Corporate Governance.
background	4 Organisations, and their board of directors, have become increasingly aware that securing information is vital for the organisation in both financial terms and corporate identity.
background	5 Wireless Networks, and the use of mobile devices, are bringing the world a new means of communication and day-to-day business activities.
background	6 The implementation of these new Wireless devices also brings about new security threats to Information assets.
result	7 This paper will determine the risks involved with new technologies and motivate the importance of understanding these risks before its implementation by emphasising the important role Corporate and IT Governance play.

background	1 Recently, similarity queries on feature vectors have been widely used to perform content-based retrieval of images.
objective	2 To apply this technique to large databases, it is required to develop multidimensional index structures supporting nearest neighbor queries efficiently.
objective	3 The SS-tree had been proposed for this purpose and is known to outperform other index structures such as the R*-tree and the K-D-B-tree.
method	4 One of its most important features is that it employs bounding spheres rather than bounding rectangles for the shape of regions.
result	5 However, we demonstrate in this paper that bounding spheres occupy much larger volume than bounding rectangles with high-dimensional data and that this reduces search efficiency.
method	6 To overcome this drawback, we propose a new index structure called the SR-tree (Sphere/Rectangle-tree) which integrates bounding spheres and bounding rectangles.
result	7 A region of the SR-tree is specified by the intersection of a bounding sphere and a bounding rectangle.
result	8 Incorporating bounding rectangles permits neighborhoods to be partitioned into smaller regions than the SS-tree and improves the disjointness among regions.
result	9 This enhances the performance on nearest neighbor queries especially for high-dimensional and non-uniform data which can be practical in actual image/video similarity indexing.
result	10 We include the performance test results the verify this advantage of the SR-tree and show that the SR-tree outperforms both the SS-tree and the R*-tree.

background	1 Underwater range scanning techniques are starting to gain interest in underwater exploration, providing new tools to represent the seafloor.
background	2 These scans (often) acquired by underwater robots usually result in an unstructured point cloud, but given the common downward-looking or forward-looking configuration of these sensors with respect to the scene, the problem of recovering a piecewise linear approximation representing the scene is normally solved by approximating these 3D points using a heightmap (2.5D).
background	3 Nevertheless, this representation is not able to correctly represent complex structures, especially those presenting arbitrary concavities normally exhibited in underwater objects.
method	4 We present a method devoted to full 3D surface reconstruction that does not assume any specific sensor configuration.
method	5 The method presented is robust to common defects in raw scanned data such as outliers and noise often present in extreme environments such as underwater, both for sonar and optical surveys.
method	6 Moreover, the proposed method does not need a manual preprocessing step.
method	7 It is also generic as it does not need any information other than the points themselves to work.
result	8 This property leads to its wide application to any kind of range scanning technologies and we demonstrate its versatility by using it on synthetic data, controlled laser scans, and multibeam sonar surveys.
method	9 Finally, and given the unbeatable level of detail that optical methods can provide, we analyze the application of this method on optical datasets related to biology, geology

background	1 Invasive species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss.
background	2 In the past decade, the development of environmental spectroscopy, both field spectrometers and airborne imaging spectrometers, has allowed progress in identifying individual species from remote sensing data.
objective	3 However, use of environmental spectroscopy for species identification needs understanding at a more fundamental level, especially the development of generalized methodologies and rules for detection and mapping, which is an area of active research today.
result	4 These issues will be explored using examples from a wide range of habitats and site conditions, towards the development of a robust methodology to identify native and non-native species.

background	1 Enforcing security in Internet of Things environments has been identified as one of the top barriers for realizing the vision of smart, energy-efficient homes and buildings.
objective	2 In this context, understanding the risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes, partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus requires substantial investigation.
method	3 A risk analysis applied on a smart home automation system developed in a research project involving leading industrial actors has been conducted.
method	4 Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were deemed as moderate.
method	5 The risks classified as high were either related to the human factor or to the software components of the system.
result	6 The results indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new, as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor, need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to handle.
result	7 A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy included in the design phase of smart homes.
result	8 With such a model of security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments.

background	1 The performance of pattern classifiers depends on the separability of the classes in the feature space - a property related to the quality of the descriptors - and the choice of informative training samples for user labeling - a procedure that usually requires active learning.
objective	2 This work is devoted to improve the quality of the descriptors when samples are superpixels from remote sensing images.
method	3 We introduce a new scheme for superpixel description based on Bag of visual Words, which includes information from adjacent superpixels, and validate it by using two remote sensing images and several region descriptors as baselines.

background	1 Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models.
background	2 In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed.
background	3 In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices.
result	4 As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL).
objective	5 Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and powerhungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks.
result	6 We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated.
result	7 Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.

background	1 The state-of-the-art of face recognition has been significantly advanced by the emergence of deep learning.
background	2 Very deep neural networks recently achieved great success on general object recognition because of their superb learning capacity.
objective	3 This motivates us to investigate their effectiveness on face recognition.
objective	4 This paper proposes two very deep neural network architectures, referred to as DeepID3, for face recognition.
method	5 These two architectures are rebuilt from stacked convolution and inception layers proposed in VGG net [10] and GoogLeNet [16] to make them suitable to face recognition.
method	6 Joint face identification-verification supervisory signals are added to both intermediate and final feature extraction layers during training.
result	7 An ensemble of the proposed two architectures achieves 99.53% LFW face verification accuracy and 96.0% LFW rank-1 face identification accuracy, respectively.
result	8 A further discussion of LFW face verification result is given in the end.

background	1 We describe a system for transforming an off-the-shelf flatbed scanner into a $200 scan backend for large format cameras.
background	2 While we describe both software and hardware aspects, the focus of the paper is on software issues such as color calibration and removal of scanner artifacts.
method	3 With current scanner technology, the resulting camera system is capable of taking black&white, color, or near-infrared photographs with up to 490 million pixels.
result	4 Our analysis shows that we achieve actual optical resolutions close to the theoretical maximum, and that color reproduction is comparable to commercial camera systems.
result	5 We believe that the camera system described here has many potential applications in image-based modeling and rendering, cultural heritage projects, and professional digital photography.

background	1 We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene.
background	2 Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to structure from motion approaches.
background	3 The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework.
method	4 Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation.
method	5 Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware.
result	6 This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas.
result	7 We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera

background	1 Ease of use and usefulness are believed to be fundamental in determining the acceptance and use of various, corporate ITs.
background	2 These beliefs, however, may not explain the user's behavior toward newly emerging ITs, such as the World-Wide-Web (WWW).

background	1 Call Centers are important channels of communication within the consumer relationship and a point of integration between suppliers and their customers.
background	2 Correctly sizing the capacity of a given Call Center can bring benefits not only in terms of improved customer service (efficacy), but also in terms of reduced operating costs (efficiency).
method	3 However, specifying the capacity of a Call Center is not a trivial task, but one that demands a significant knowledge of mathematics, in particular of analytical models.

background	1 We present a new dataset and model for textual entailment, derived from treating multiple-choice question-answering as an entailment problem.
result	2 SCITAIL is the first entailment set that is created solely from natural sentences that already exist independently “in the wild” rather than sentences authored specifically for the entailment task.
method	3 Different from existing entailment datasets, we create hypotheses from science questions and the corresponding answer candidates, and premises from relevant web sentences retrieved from a large corpus.
result	4 These sentences are often linguistically challenging.
method	5 This, combined with the high lexical similarity of premise and hypothesis for both entailed and non-entailed pairs, makes this new entailment task particularly difficult.
result	6 The resulting challenge is evidenced by state-of-the-art textual entailment systems achieving mediocre performance on SCITAIL, especially in comparison to a simple majority class baseline.
result	7 As a step forward, we demonstrate that one can improve accuracy on SCITAIL by 5% using a new neural model that exploits linguistic structure.

background	1 Chinese noun classifiers are an indispensible part of the Chinese language, but are difficult for non-native speakers to use correctly.
background	2 Chinese language teachers often face challenges in finding an effective way to teach classifiers, as the rules for defining which nouns can be associated with which classifiers are not straightforward.
background	3 Many theoretical studies have explored the nature of Chinese classifiers, but few studies take an empirical approach to the investigation of effective teaching and learning methods of classifiers.
background	4 Learners often find that existing dictionaries either do not have classifiers as lexical entries, or give very brief explanations that are hardly helpful.
background	5 This paper presents the progress of an ongoing project on the construction of an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers.
objective	6 The objective of the project is to provide a platform for Chinese language learners to explore and learn classifier uses in a bottom-up fashion.

method	8 Descriptions of the design and the functions of the e-learning tool are provided in the paper.

background	1 We present a content-based automatic music tagging algorithm using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs).
background	2 We evaluate different architectures consisting of 2D convolutional layers and subsampling layers only.
background	3 In the experiments, we measure the AUC-ROC scores of the architectures with different complexities and input types using the MagnaTagATune dataset, where a 4-layer architecture shows state-of-the-art performance with mel-spectrogram input.
method	4 Furthermore, we evaluated the performances of the architectures with varying the number of layers on a larger dataset (Million Song Dataset), and found that deeper models outperformed the 4-layer architecture.
result	5 The experiments show that mel-spectrogram is an effective time-frequency representation for automatic tagging and that more complex models benefit from more training data.

background	1 This paper considers the task of matching images and sentences.
background	2 The challenge consists in discriminatively embedding the two modalities onto a shared visual-textual space.
background	3 Existing work in this field largely uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for text feature learning and employs off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction.
background	4 Our system, in comparison, differs in two key aspects.
method	5 Firstly, we build a convolutional network amenable for fine-tuning the visual and textual representations, where the entire network only contains four components, i.e., convolution layer, pooling layer, rectified linear unit function (ReLU), and batch normalisation.
method	6 Endto-end learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilise the supervisions.
method	7 Secondly, we propose instance loss according to viewing each multimodal data pair as a class.
method	8 This works with a large margin objective to learn the inter-modal correspondence between images and their textual descriptions.
result	9 Experiments on two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO) demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
result	10 Moreover, in language person retrieval, we improve the state of the art by a large margin.

background	1 ROC analysis is increasingly being recognised as an important tool for evaluation and comparison of classifiers when the operating characteristics (i.e. class distribution and cost parameters) are not known at training time.
background	2 Usually, each classifier is characterised by its estimated true and false positive rates and is represented by a single point in the ROC diagram.
objective	3 In this paper, we show how a single decision tree can represent a set of classifiers by choosing different labellings of its leaves, or equivalently, an ordering on the leaves.
objective	4 In this setting, rather than estimating the accuracy of a single tree, it makes more sense to use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a quality metric.
objective	5 We also propose a novel splitting criterion which chooses the split with the highest local AUC.
background	6 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first probabilistic splitting criterion that is not based on weighted average impurity.
result	7 We present experiments suggesting that the AUC splitting criterion leads to trees with equal or better AUC value, without sacrificing accuracy if a single labelling is chosen.

background	1 As the models and the datasets to train deep learning (DL) models scale, system architects are faced with new challenges, one of which is the memory capacity bottleneck, where the limited physical memory inside the accelerator device constrains the algorithm that can be studied.
objective	2 We propose a memory-centric deep learning system that can transparently expand the memory capacity accessible to the accelerators while also providing fast inter-device communication for parallel training.
objective	3 Our proposal aggregates a pool of memory modules locally within the device-side interconnect, which are decoupled from the host interface and function as a vehicle for transparent memory capacity expansion.

background	1 In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates.
background	2 While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace.
background	3 This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data.
background	4 The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process.
background	5 Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research.
objective	6 This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field

objective	1 The experimental evidence accumulated over the past 20 years indicates that text indexing systems based on the assignment of appropriately weighted single terms produce retrieval results that are superior to those obtainable with other more elaborate text representations.

background	5 AUTOMATIC TEXT ANALYSIS In the late 195Os, Luhn [l] first suggested that automatic text retrieval systems could be designed based on a comparison of content identifiers attached both to the stored texts and to the users’ information queries.
result	6 Typically, certain words extracted from the texts of documents and queries would be used for content identification; alternatively, the content representations could be chosen manually by trained indexers familiar with the subject areas under consideration and with the contents of the document collections.

background	2 in images – attracted a lot of attention from the community during the last 5 years.
background	3 This strong interest can be explained not only by the importance this task has for many applications but also by the phenomenal advances in this area since the arrival of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN).
objective	4 This article reviews the recent literature on object detection with deep CNN, in a comprehensive way, and provides an in-depth view of these recent advances.
result	5 The survey covers not only the typical architectures (SSD, YOLO, Faster-RCNN) but also discusses the challenges currently met by the community and goes on to show how the problem of object detection can be extended.

background	1 The famous Towers of Hanoi puzzle consists of 3 pegs (A, B, C) on one of which (A) are stacked n rings of different sizes, each ring resting on a larger ring.
objective	2 The objective is to move the n rings one by one until they are all stacked on another peg (B) in such a way that no ring is ever placed on a smaller ring; the other peg (C) can be used as workspace.
method	3 The problem has tong been a favourite iir programming courses as one which admits a concise recursive solution.
method	4 This solution hinges on the observation that, when the largest ring is moved from A to B, the n 1 remaining rings must all be on peg C. This immediately leads to the recursive procedure

background	1 A growing number of information technology systems and services are being developed to change users’ attitudes or behavior or both.
background	2 Despite the fact that attitudinal theories from social psychology have been quite extensively applied to the study of user intentions and behavior, these theories have been developed for predicting user acceptance of the information technology rather than for providing systematic analysis and design methods for developing persuasive software solutions.
objective	3 This article is conceptual and theory-creating by its nature, suggesting a framework for Persuasive Systems Design (PSD).
method	4 It discusses the process of designing and evaluating persuasive systems and describes what kind of content and software functionality may be found in the final product.

result	8 Moreover, a new categorization of these principles is proposed, consisting of the primary task, dialogue, system credibility, and social support categories.

method	1 We introduce a new model for replication in distributed systems.
background	2 The primary motivation for replication lies in fault tolerance.
method	3 Although there are different kinds of replication approaches, our model combines the advantages of modular redundancy and primary-stand-by approaches to give more flexibility with respect to system configuration.
method	4 To implement such a model, we select the IBM PC-net with MS-DOS environment as our base.
background	5 Transparency as well as fault-tolerance file access are the highlights of our system design.
method	6 To fulfil these requirements, we incorporate the idea of directory-oriented replication and extended prefix tab/es in the system design.
method	7 The implementation consists of a command shell, a DOS manager, and a recovery manager.
result	8 Through this design, we can simulate a UNIX-like distributed file system whose function is compatible with MS-DOS.

background	1 This paper presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors.
background	2 Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer.
objective	3 The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation.
objective	4 A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined.
method	5 The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions.
method	6 The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame.
background	7 The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter.
result	8 As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time.
result	9 Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory.
result	10 Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels.

method	2 Our method, called Mapper, is based on the idea of partial clustering of the data guided by a set of functions defined on the data.
method	3 The proposed method is not dependent on any particular clustering algorithm, i.e. any clustering algorithm may be used with Mapper.
result	4 We implement this method and present a few sample applications in which simple descriptions of the data present important information about its structure.

background	1 The e-government field, like most young fields, lacks a strong body of well-developed theory.
background	2 One strategy for coping with theoretical immaturity is to import and adapt theories from other, more mature fields.
objective	3 This study reviews Stakeholder Theory (ST) and investigates its potential in relation to e-Government.
method	4 Originally a management theory, stakeholder theory advocates addressing the concerns of all stakeholders in a firm, as opposed to concentration on the interests of senior managers and stockholders.
method	5 Apart from its original profit focus, there is no serious conceptual mismatch between stakeholder theory and government’s objective of providing policy and services for citizens and organizations – society’s stakeholders.
result	6 Potential problems with adapting a management theory to a government setting are discussed.
result	7 The paper further discusses how information technology impacts a stakeholder model of governance.
result	8 Finally, the paper makes recommendations for future work in adapting ST to the e-government context.

background	1 High level data quality and the management of ensuring data quality is one of the key success factors for Data Warehousing projects.
background	2 The following article describes an approach for Data Quality Management, which is based on theories as well as practical experiences.
objective	3 Starting from effects of insufficient data quality in practice, a definition for information, data and data quality will be worked out.
objective	4 Based on the concept of total data quality management the Data Quality Management (DQM) for Data-Warehouse-System will be described.
objective	5 As key part DQM an approach for operative DQM (planing and measuring data quality) will be illustrated and explained.
result	6 Finally, based on the research results further conclusions are summarised.

background	1 This paper gives an overview of shape dissimilarity measure properties, such as metric and robustness properties, and of retrieval performance measures.
method	2 Fifteen shape similarity measures are shortly described and compared.
method	3 Their retrieval results on the MPEG-7 Core Experiment CE-Shape-1 test set as reported in the literature and obtained by a reimplementation are compared and discussed.

background	1 Inventory systems with uncertainty go hand in hand with the determination of a safety stock level.
background	2 The decision on the safety stock level is based on a performance measure, for example the expected shortage per replenishment period or the probability of a stock-out per replenishment period.
method	3 The performance measure assumes complete knowledge of the probability distribution during lead time, which might not be available.
objective	4 In case of incomplete information regarding the lead-time distribution of demand, no single figure for the safety stock can de determined in order to satisfy a performance measure.
objective	5 However, an optimisation model may be formulated in order to determine a safety stock level which guarantees the performance measure under the worst case of lead-time demand, of which the distribution is known in an incomplete way.
result	6 It is shown that this optimisation problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem.

background	1 User-generated reviews on the Web contain sentiments about detailed aspects of products and services.
background	2 However, most of the reviews are plain text and thus require much effort to obtain information about relevant details.
method	3 In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically discovering what aspects are evaluated in reviews and how sentiments for different aspects are expressed.
method	4 We first propose Sentence-LDA (SLDA), a probabilistic generative model that assumes all words in a single sentence are generated from one aspect.
method	5 We then extend SLDA to Aspect and Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM), which incorporates aspect and sentiment together to model sentiments toward different aspects.
method	6 ASUM discovers pairs of {aspect, sentiment} which we call senti-aspects.
method	7 We applied SLDA and ASUM to reviews of electronic devices and restaurants.
result	8 The results show that the aspects discovered by SLDA match evaluative details of the reviews, and the senti-aspects found by ASUM capture important aspects that are closely coupled with a sentiment.
result	9 The results of sentiment classification show that ASUM outperforms other generative models and comes close to supervised classification methods.
result	10 One important advantage of ASUM is that it does not require any sentiment labels of the reviews, which are often expensive to obtain.

background	1 The paper presents the results of a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) development for the diesel engine air path.
objective	2 The objective is to regulate the intake manifold pressure (MAP) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate to the specified set-points by coordinated control of the variable geometry turbine (VGT), EGR valve, and EGR throttle.
method	3 The approach uses tube-MPC to robustly enforce state constraints in the presence of set-bounded engine speed and fueling disturbances.
method	4 Furthermore, a rate-based formulation along with various approximations is applied to reduce the conservativeness and computational complexity of tube-MPC.
result	5 The ability of the controller to handle input and output constraints is demonstrated in both nonlinear model simulations and experimental results.

background	1 Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data.
background	2 Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences.
background	3 In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences.
background	4 Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities.
background	5 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes.
background	6 Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window.
objective	7 Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them.
background	8 In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition.
background	9 In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models.
other	10 When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature.

background	1 The rapid adoption of heterogeneous computing has driven the integration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) into cloud datacenters and flexible System-on-Chips (SoCs).
objective	2 This paper shows that the integrated FPGA introduces a new security vulnerability by enabling software-based power side-channel attacks without physical proximity to a target system.
method	3 We first demonstrate that an on-chip power monitor can be built on a modern FPGA using ring oscillators (ROs), and characterize its ability to observe the power consumption of other modules on the FPGA or the SoC. Then, we show that the RO-based FPGA power monitor can be used for a successful power analysis attack on an RSA cryptomodule on the same FPGA.
result	4 Additionally, we show that the FPGA-based power monitor can observe the power consumption of a CPU on the same SoC, and demonstrate that the FPGA-to-CPU power side-channel attack can break timing-channel protection for a RSA program running on a CPU.
result	5 This work introduces and demonstrates remote power side-channel attacks using an FPGA, showing that the common assumption that power side-channel attacks require specialized equipment and physical access to the victim hardware is not true for systems with an integrated FPGA.

background	1 In recent decades, the ad hoc network for vehicles has been a core network technology to provide comfort and security to drivers in vehicle environments.
background	2 However, emerging applications and services require major changes in underlying network models and computing that require new road network planning.
background	3 Meanwhile, blockchain widely known as one of the disruptive technologies has emerged in recent years, is experiencing rapid development and has the potential to revolutionize intelligent transport systems.
method	4 Blockchain can be used to build an intelligent, secure, distributed and autonomous transport system.
background	5 It allows better utilization of the infrastructure and resources of intelligent transport systems, particularly effective for crowdsourcing technology.
objective	6 In this paper, we proposes a vehicle network architecture based on blockchain in the smart city (Block-VN).
objective	7 Block-VN is a reliable and secure architecture that operates in a distributed way to build the new distributed transport management system.
objective	8 We are considering a new network system of vehicles, Block-VN, above them.
method	9 In addition, we examine how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular information.
method	10 Finally, we discuss service scenarios and design principles for Block-VN.

background	1 Over the past few years, neural networks have re-emerged as powerful machine-learning models, yielding state-of-the-art results in fields such as image recognition and speech processing.
background	2 More recently, neural network models started to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very promising results.
method	3 This tutorial surveys neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring natural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques.
objective	4 The tutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as well as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.

background	1 Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction.
background	2 K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks.
method	3 Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering.
method	4 New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix.
method	5 These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning.
result	6 Several implications are discussed.
result	7 On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noise-reduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data.
result	8 On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering.
result	9 DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results.
result	10 Experiments indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5% of the optimal values.

objective	1 A recommender system aims to recommend items that a user is interested in among many items.
background	2 The need for the recommender system has been expanded by the information explosion.
method	3 Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users.
method	4 One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as aMarkov decision process (MDP) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL).
method	5 However, existing RL-based methods have an obvious drawback.
result	6 To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL to a larger class of problems.
method	7 In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based recommender system.
method	8 We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly.
method	9 Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem.
result	10 In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items.

background	1 In this chapter methods of handling missing attribute values in data mining are described.
background	2 These methods are categorized into sequential and parallel.
method	3 In sequential methods, missing attribute values are replaced by known values first, as a preprocessing, then the knowledge is acquired for a data set with all known attribute values.
method	4 In parallel methods, there is no preprocessing, i.e., knowledge is acquired directly from the original data sets.
method	5 In this chapter the main emphasis is put on rule induction.
method	6 Methods of handling attribute values for decision tree generation are only briefly summarized.

background	1 We study the problem of object recognition for categories for which we have no training examples, a task also called zero--data or zero-shot learning.
background	2 This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them.
objective	3 To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape.
method	4 Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task.
method	5 Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase.
result	6 In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes.
result	7 Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes.

background	1 We present an unsupervised representation learning approach that compactly encodes the motion dependencies in videos.
background	2 Given a pair of images from a video clip, our framework learns to predict the long-term 3D motions.
background	3 To reduce the complexity of the learning framework, we propose to describe the motion as a sequence of atomic 3D flows computed with RGB-D modality.
method	4 We use a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder framework to predict these sequences of flows.
method	5 We argue that in order for the decoder to reconstruct these sequences, the encoder must learn a robust video representation that captures long-term motion dependencies and spatial-temporal relations.
method	6 We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned temporal representations on activity classification across multiple modalities and datasets such as NTU RGB+D and MSR Daily Activity 3D.
method	7 Our framework is generic to any input modality, i.e., RGB, depth, and RGB-D videos.

background	1 We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility maximization in multichannel wireless networks.
background	2 The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and the users access the spectrum using a random access protocol.
background	3 In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain attempt probability.
background	4 After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal).
objective	5 The objective is to find a multi-user strategy that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users.
objective	6 Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states.
method	7 To tackle this problem, we develop a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning.
method	8 Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function.
result	9 Experimental results have demonstrated that users are capable to learn good policies that achieve strong performance in this challenging partially observable setting only from their ACK signals, without online coordination, message exchanges between users, or carrier sensing.

background	1 We present a new method to visualize from an ensemble of flow fields the statistical properties of streamlines passing through a selected location.
method	2 We use principal component analysis to transform the set of streamlines into a low-dimensional Euclidean space.
method	3 In this space the streamlines are clustered into major trends, and each cluster is in turn approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
background	4 This yields a probabilistic mixture model for the streamline distribution, from which confidence regions can be derived in which the streamlines are most likely to reside.
method	5 This is achieved by transforming the Gaussian random distributions from the low-dimensional Euclidean space into a streamline distribution that follows the statistical model, and by visualizing confidence regions in this distribution via iso-contours.
method	6 We further make use of the principal component representation to introduce a new concept of streamline-median, based on existing median concepts in multidimensional Euclidean spaces.
result	7 We demonstrate the potential of our method in a number of real-world examples, and we compare our results to alternative clustering approaches for particle trajectories as well as curve boxplots.

background	1 The ever-increasing size of modern data sets combined with the difficulty of obtaining label information has made semi-supervised learning one of the problems of significant practical importance in modern data analysis.
background	2 We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones.
background	3 Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable.
method	4 We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.

background	1 'No-shows' or missed appointments result in under-utilized clinic capacity.
objective	2 We develop a logistic regression model using electronic medical records to estimate patients' no-show probabilities and illustrate the use of the estimates in creating clinic schedules that maximize clinic capacity utilization while maintaining small patient waiting times and clinic overtime costs.
method	3 This study used information on scheduled outpatient appointments collected over a three-year period at a Veterans Affairs medical center.
method	4 The call-in process for 400 clinic days was simulated and for each day two schedules were created: the traditional method that assigned one patient per appointment slot, and the proposed method that scheduled patients according to their no-show probability to balance patient waiting, overtime and revenue.
method	5 Combining patient no-show models with advanced scheduling methods would allow more patients to be seen a day while improving clinic efficiency.
result	6 Clinics should consider the benefits of implementing scheduling software that includes these methods relative to the cost of no-shows.

background	1 We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification.
background	2 Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology.
objective	3 Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set.
method	4 This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call cardinality (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width.
method	5 On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy.
method	6 Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity.
result	7 Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place.
result	8 We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart.
result	9 The code and models are publicly available online.

background	1 The proliferation of cyber-physical systems introduces the fourth stage of industrialization, commonly known as Industry 4.0.
background	2 The vertical integration of various components inside a factory to implement a flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing system, i.e., smart factory, is one of the key features of Industry 4.0.
background	3 In this paper, we present a smart factory framework that incorporates industrial network, cloud, and supervisory control terminals with smart shop-floor objects such as machines, conveyers, and products.
method	4 Then, we provide a classification of the smart objects into various types of agents and define a coordinator in the cloud.
method	5 The autonomous decision and distributed cooperation between agents lead to high flexibility.
method	6 Moreover, this kind of self-organized system leverages the feedback and coordination by the central coordinator in order to achieve high efficiency.
method	7 Thus, the smart factory is characterized by a self-organized multi-agent system assisted with big data based feedback and coordination.
method	8 Based on this model, we propose an intelligent negotiation mechanism for agents to cooperate with each other.
method	9 Furthermore, the study illustrates that complementary strategies can be designed to prevent deadlocks by improving the agents’ decision making and the coordinator’s behavior.
result	10 The simulation results assess the effectiveness of the proposed negotiation mechanism and deadlock prevention strategies.

background	1 State-of-the-art named entity recognition systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge in order to learn effectively from the small, supervised training corpora that are available.
background	2 In this paper, we introduce two new neural architectures—one based on bidirectional LSTMs and conditional random fields, and the other that constructs and labels segments using a transition-based approach inspired by shift-reduce parsers.
method	3 Our models rely on two sources of information about words: character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and unsupervised word representations learned from unannotated corpora.
objective	4 Our models obtain state-of-the-art performance in NER in four languages without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers.

background	1 An understanding of quality attributes is relevant for the software organization to deliver high software reliability.
background	2 An empirical assessment of metrics to predict the quality attributes is essential in order to gain insight about the quality of software in the early phases of software development and to ensure corrective actions.
objective	3 In this paper, we predict a model to estimate fault proneness using Object Oriented CK metrics and QMOOD metrics.
method	4 We apply one statistical method and six machine learning methods to predict the models.
method	5 The proposed models are validated using dataset collected from Open Source software.
method	6 The results are analyzed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis.
result	7 The results show that the model predicted using the random forest and bagging methods outperformed all the other models.
result	8 Hence, based on these results it is reasonable to claim that quality models have a significant relevance with Object Oriented metrics and that machine learning methods have a comparable performance with statistical methods Keywords—Empirical Validation, Object Oriented, Receiver Operating Characteristics, Statistical Methods, Machine Learning, Fault Prediction

objective	1 The goal of this work is to develop a soft robotic manipulation system that is capable of autonomous, dynamic, and safe interactions with humans and its environment.
background	2 First, we develop a dynamic model for a multi-body fluidic elastomer manipulator that is composed entirely from soft rubber and subject to the self-loading effects of gravity.
method	3 Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy.
method	4 Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs.
result	5 In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92% of the time.
result	6 By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.

background	1 Localization is one important part of Internet of Things(IoT) where the Location of Everything (LoE) system plays a important role to improve most services in IoT area.
background	2 On the other hand, data mining techniques are essential analyses when we have big data from IoT platforms.
background	3 Indeed, integration of location-based methods and data mining analysis process can make a smart system service for IoT scenarios and applications.
method	4 For this purpose, we design a smart shopping platform including four components, location of everything component, data collection component, data filtering/analysing component and data mining component.
method	5 Then a novel accurate localization scheme named “location orbital” is developed that estimates the current location of mobile objects (users or everything) based on both current and the previous locations.
method	6 Finally, an implementation of the experiment in a shopping mall is conducted to practically examine performance evaluation of the location-based scheme.
result	7 The experimental results show that the proposed scheme could achieve significant higher precision than other localization techniques.

background	1 Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image.
method	2 This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on graytone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in categoryidentification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories.
objective	3 We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule).
objective	4 In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set.
background	5 Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.
result	6 These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.

background	1 How many moves does it take to solve Rubik’s Cube?
method	2 Positions are known that require 20 moves, and it has already been shown that there are no positions that require 27 or more moves; this is a surprisingly large gap.
method	3 This paper describes a program that is able to find solutions of length 20 or less at a rate of more than 16 million positions a second.
objective	4 We use this program, along with some new ideas and incremental improvements in other techniques, to show that there is no position that requires 26 moves.

background	1 The movement to real-time is the latest development in business intelligence (BI) and data warehousing.
background	2 Real-time data warehousing provides the data that is required to implement realtime BI.
background	3 By moving to real-time, firms can use BI to affect current decision making and business processes.
background	4 This capability is especially important for customer-facing applications, such as those found in call centers and check-in processes, and helps firms become more customer-centric.
method	5 Terms such as the “real-time enterprise” and the “zero latency organization” are often used to describe firms that use real-time BI.

objective	1 This paper describes an efficient system for entering data into a pen-enabled computer, particularly handheld devices.
objective	2 While keyboard input typically is faster than handwriting input, this is not true for the small PDA interfaces.
method	3 For this reason, we designed and developed a prototype that uses chatroom abbreviations and shorthand symbols to increase the speed of data entry for these devices.
method	4 This system was also developed as a prototype system that would enable persons with speech impairments to rapidly convert hand-drawn symbols on a pen-enabled device into speech output.
result	5 We created a library of chatroom abbreviations and shorthand symbols, and developed a k-nn classification system to recognize the symbols.
result	6 Experimental results show the effectiveness of the system in terms of speed and accuracy.

background	1 We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains.
method	2 We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows.
method	3 We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multiagent coordination.
method	4 Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies.
method	5 We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.

background	1 Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor.
method	2 In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving.
objective	3 We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving.
method	4 Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously.
method	5 Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction.
method	6 To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments.
result	7 We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset.
result	8 Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.
result	9 Source code and data are available on our project website.

background	1 The design of a low-frequency high-input-impedance amplifier having probably the lowest noise ever reported is presented.
background	2 The amplifier's frequency range is from about 0.07 Hz to about 110 kHz at the -3-dB level.
background	3 The equivalent input noise voltage spectral density is about 5.6, 1.4, 0.6, and 0.5 nV/radicHz at frequencies 0.1, 1, 10, and 1000 Hz, respectively.
method	4 Gain of the amplifier is about 83 dB. Noise analysis is made for active-type, capacitive-type, and low impedance signal sources.
result	5 The contribution from different noise sources in the amplifier and JFET to the overall noise is shown.

background	1 In this paper we derive a linear-time, constant-space algorithm to construct a binary heap whose inorder traversal equals a given sequence.
background	2 We do so in two steps.
method	3 First, we invert a program that computes the inorder traversal of a binary heap, using the proof rules for program inversion by W. Chen and J.T. Udding.
method	4 This results in a linear-time solution in terms of binary trees.
result	5 Subsequently, we data-refine this program to a constant-space solution in terms of linked structures.

background	1 As business competition becomes global, international information systems (IIS) management presents a signi®cant challenge to multinational corporations and their af®liates.
background	2 However, very few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the management of IIS and the issues that confront the IS executives of such corporations.
objective	3 In this study, we perform a three-round Delphi study to identify, rank and evaluate the twenty most signi®cant IIS issues of af®liates.
method	4 The ratings of these issues suggest that technology infrastructure concerns, rather than planning and management concerns, have a larger impact on the IS operations of foreign af®liates.
method	5 This study also reports on statistical analyses to differentiate the impact of different industries, respondents, IS structures and international involvement of af®liates on IIS issues ratings.
result	6 The results indicate that respondents of IS and non-IS executives and af®liates of different international involvement levels have different views on the ratings of IIS issues.
result	7 Our study also con®rms that IIS issues can signi®cantly impact the strategic, tactical and operational IS decisions of af®liates.
result	8 These ®ndings allow some important implications to be drawn for both practitioners and researchers dealing with IIS issues.

background	1 IT architecture is often assumed to follow business strategy, to align IT with the business’s strategic objectives.
background	2 Increasingly, though, many business strategies depend on specific underlying IT capabilities.
background	3 To develop a synergy between business strategy and IT architecture, firms must develop organizational competencies in IT architecture.
objective	4 My research has identified four IT architectural stages, each with its own requisite competencies.
method	5 The “application silo architecture stage” consists of IT architectures of individual applications.
method	6 The “standardized technology architecture stage” has an enterprise-wide IT architecture that provides efficiencies through technology standardization.
result	7 The “rationalized data architecture stage” extends the enterprise-wide IT standards to data and processes.
result	8 And the “modular architecture stage” builds onto enterprise-wide global standards with loosely coupled IT components to preserve the global standards while enabling local differences.
result	9 Each stage demands different organizational competencies to implement the architecture and prepare the firm to move to the next stage.

background	1 With the advances in the development of mobile payments, a huge amount of payment data are collected by banks.
background	2 User payment data offer a good dataset to depict customer behavior patterns.
background	3 A comprehensive understanding of customers' purchase behavior is crucial to developing good marketing strategies, which may trigger much greater purchase amounts.
method	4 For example, by exploring customer behavior patterns, given a target store, a set of potential customers is able to be identified.
background	5 In other words, personalized campaigns at the right time and in the right place can be treated as the last stage of consumption.
objective	6 Here we propose a probability graphical model that exploits the payment data to discover customer purchase behavior in the spatial, temporal, payment amount and product category aspects, named STPC-PGM.
result	7 As a result, the mobility behavior of an individual user could be predicted with a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for all aspects of each customer's relationship with the payment platform.
method	8 To achieve real time advertising, we then develop an online framework that efficiently computes the prediction results.
result	9 Our experiment results show that STPC-PGM is effective in discovering customers' profiling features, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in purchase behavior prediction.
result	10 In addition, the prediction results are being deployed in the marketing of real-world credit card users, and have presented a significant growth in the advertising conversion rate.

background	1 Hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and a set of classified examples to develop a method for accurately classifying examples not seen during training.
background	2 The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source.
background	3 By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources.
background	4 KBANN(Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques.
method	5 It maps problem-specific “domain theories”, represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation.
method	6 KBANN is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology.
result	7 Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by KBANN generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.

background	1 Gamification evolved to one of the most important trends in technology and therefore gains more and more practical and scientific notice.
background	2 Yet academia lacks a comprehensive overview of research, even though a review of prior, relevant literature is essential for advancing knowledge in a field.
objective	3 Therefore a novel classification framework for Gamification in Information Systems with the intention to provide a structured, summarized as well as organized overview was constructed to close this gap of research.
method	4 A literature review on Gamification in quality outlets combined with a Grounded Theory approach served as a starting point.
method	5 As a result this paper provides a foundation for current and future research to advance the knowledge on Gamification.
result	6 Moreover it offers a structure for Gamification research which was not available previously.
result	7 Findings from the literature review were mapped to the classification framework and analyzed.
result	8 Derived from the classification framework and its outcome future research outlets were identified.

objective	1 We present a method that learns word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification in this paper.
background	2 Most existing algorithms for learning continuous word representations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment of text.
background	3 This is problematic for sentiment analysis as they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors.
method	4 We address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words.
method	5 Specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions.
method	6 To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons.
result	7 Experiments on applying SSWE to a benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating SSWE with existing feature set.

background	1 Mobile technology is a continuously growing domain and research activities regarding its use are quite intensive.
background	2 A questionnaire regarding the use of mobile devices was developed and distributed to 416 students in a Greek University.
background	3 There were completed 384 questionnaires.
background	4 The results revealed that students use their mobiles mostly for phone calls and SMS (short message service).
background	5 They also tend to use their mobiles to take photos and activate the reminder.
result	6 However, they do not deal with many of the devices’ operations.
method	7 They use their mobiles to communicate (telephone, SMS, email) mostly with their boy/girlfriend, then with their friends.
method	8 They use their mobiles mostly at home, then at the University.
background	9 Also, they consider health issues as the main reason to limit the use of their mobiles.
result	10 Finally, there was not a statistically significant relationship between genders and their preferences.

background	1 We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning.
objective	2 The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples.
method	3 In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task.
method	4 In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.
result	5 We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.

background	1 There is an increased awareness of the roles that e nterprise architecture (EA) and enterprise systems (ES) play in today ’s organizations.
background	2 EA and ES usage maturity models are used to assess how well c ompanies are capable of deploying these two concepts while striving to achi eve strategic corporate goals.
background	3 The existence of various architecture and ES usage models raises questions about how they both refer to each other, e.g. if a higher level of architecture maturity implies a higher ES usage level.
objective	4 This paper compares these two types of models by using literature survey results and case-study experiences.
result	5 We conclude that (i) EA and ES usage maturity model s agree on a number of critical success factors and (ii) in a company with a mature architecture function, one is likely to observe, at the early stages of ES initiatives, certain practices associated with a higher level of ES usage ma turity.

background	1 Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure.
background	2 The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis.
method	3 Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof).
method	4 The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.
result	5 Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.

background	1 Learning to predict future images from a video sequence involves the construction of an internal representation that models the image evolution accurately, and therefore, to some degree, its content and dynamics.
background	2 This is why pixel-space video prediction is viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning.
objective	3 In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence.
method	4 To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function.
result	5 We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset.

background	1 The amount of data stored by banks is rapidly increasing and provides the opportunity for banks to conduct predictive analytics and enhance its businesses.

method	4 Combining IBM software platforms and big data processing power with customized data analytical models, the iCARE solution provides deeper customer insights to satisfy a bank’s specific business need and data environment.
method	5 The advantages of the iCARE framework have been confirmed in a real case study of a bank in southeast China.
result	6 In this case, iCARE helps generate insights for active customers based on their transaction behavior, using close to 20 terabytes of data.

background	1 From scientific research to commercial applications, eye tracking is an important tool across many domains.
background	2 Despite its range of applications, eye tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology.
background	3 We believe that we can put the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the need for additional sensors or devices.
method	4 We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2:5M frames.
method	5 Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device.
method	6 Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively.
method	7 With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm.
result	8 Further, we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

background	1 A novel swarm intelligence optimization technique is proposed called dragonfly algorithm (DA).
background	2 The main inspiration of the DA algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature.
background	3 Two essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically.
objective	4 The paper also considers the proposal of binary and multi-objective versions of DA called binary DA (BDA) and multi-objective DA (MODA), respectively.
background	5 The proposed algorithms are benchmarked by several mathematical test functions and one real case study qualitatively and quantitatively.
result	6 The results of DA and BDA prove that the proposed algorithms are able to improve the initial random population for a given problem, converge towards the global optimum, and provide very competitive results compared to other well-known algorithms in the literature.
result	7 The results of MODA also show that this algorithm tends to find very accurate approximations of Pareto optimal solutions with high uniform distribution for multi-objective problems.
result	8 The set of designs obtained for the submarine propeller design problem demonstrate the merits of MODA in solving challenging real problems with unknown true Pareto optimal front as well.
result	9 Note that the source codes of the DA, BDA, and MODA algorithms are publicly available at http://www.alimirjalili.com/DA.html .

objective	1 We propose a new approach for general object tracking with fully convolutional neural network.
method	2 Instead of treating convolutional neural network (CNN) as a black-box feature extractor, we conduct in-depth study on the properties of CNN features offline pre-trained on massive image data and classification task on ImageNet.
result	3 The discoveries motivate the design of our tracking system.
result	4 It is found that convolutional layers in different levels characterize the target from different perspectives.
result	5 A top layer encodes more semantic features and serves as a category detector, while a lower layer carries more discriminative information and can better separate the target from distracters with similar appearance.
result	6 Both layers are jointly used with a switch mechanism during tracking.
background	7 It is also found that for a tracking target, only a subset of neurons are relevant.
method	8 A feature map selection method is developed to remove noisy and irrelevant feature maps, which can reduce computation redundancy and improve tracking accuracy.
result	9 Extensive evaluation on the widely used tracking benchmark [36] shows that the proposed tacker outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.

background	1 Recognising the need for the development of research capacity and changing learning paradigms that include online and collaborative approaches, an ontology of research methodology needs to be developed to allow for the shared creation of knowledge in this domain.
objective	2 An ontology engineering approach is followed in developing a conceptual model of the domain using UML, with a focus on studies in the computing disciplines.
objective	3 A research scheme that is made up of a philosophical world view, a research design, and research methods is proposed.
method	4 Appropriate relations between these are identified, as well as attributes of the various concepts in the conceptual model.
result	5 A focus group consisting of senior researchers in the field of computing was utilised to validate the model.

background	1 The representation of a knowledge graph (KG) in a latent space recently has attracted more and more attention.
background	2 To this end, some proposed models (e.g., TransE) embed entities and relations of a KG into a "point" vector space by optimizing a global loss function which ensures the scores of positive triplets are higher than negative ones.
background	3 We notice that these models always regard all entities and relations in a same manner and ignore their (un)certainties.
method	4 In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties, which makes identical certainty insufficient for modeling.
method	5 Therefore, this paper switches to density-based embedding and propose KG2E for explicitly modeling the certainty of entities and relations, which learn the representations of KGs in the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
result	6 Each entity/relation is represented by a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes its position and the covariance (currently with diagonal covariance) can properly represent its certainty.
method	7 In addition, compared with the symmetric measures used in point-based methods, we employ the KL-divergence for scoring triplets, which is a natural asymmetry function for effectively modeling multiple types of relations.
result	8 We have conducted extensive experiments on link prediction and triplet classification with multiple benchmark datasets (WordNet and Freebase).
result	9 Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the (un)certainties of entities and relations in a KG, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including TransH and TransR).

background	1 Cloud systems require elastic resource allocation to minimize resource provisioning costs while meeting service level objectives (SLOs).
background	2 In this paper, we present a novel PRedictive Elastic reSource Scaling (PRESS) scheme for cloud systems.
method	3 PRESS unobtrusively extracts fine-grained dynamic patterns in application resource demands and adjust their resource allocations automatically.
method	4 Our approach leverages light-weight signal processing and statistical learning algorithms to achieve online predictions of dynamic application resource requirements.
method	5 We have implemented the PRESS system on Xen and tested it using RUBiS and an application load trace from Google.
result	6 Our experiments show that we can achieve good resource prediction accuracy with less than 5% over-estimation error and near zero under-estimation error, and elastic resource scaling can both significantly reduce resource waste and SLO violations.

background	1 Over the last decade the importance of network games has seen a tremendous growth.
background	2 A large part includes the size reduction of the handheld devices.
background	3 Mobile gaming in a wireless environment and the availability to play games at any place is receiving major importance.
background	4 Thus more and more games are released in this section (including a huge number of different mobile phone games).
background	5 Thus, the mobile market offers a wide variety of devices, such as the new handhelds like Nintendo DS and Sony PSP.

result	10 It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.

background	1 The end of Moores law and Dennard scaling has led to the end of rapid improvement in general-purpose program performance.
background	2 Machine learning (ML), and in particular deep learning, is an attractive alternative for architects to explore.
background	3 It has recently revolutionized vision, speech, language understanding, and many other fields, and it promises to help with the grand challenges facing our society.
method	4 The computation at its core is low-precision linear algebra.
method	5 Thus, ML is both broad enough to apply to many domains and narrow enough to benefit from domain-specific architectures, such as Googles Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
method	6 Moreover, the growth in demand for ML computing exceeds Moores law at its peak, just as it is fading.
method	7 Hence, ML experts and computer architects must work together to design the computing systems required to deliver on the potential of ML.
result	8 This article offers motivation, suggestions, and warnings to computer architects on how to best contribute to the ML revolution.

background	1 Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) constitute a new pervasive and ubiquitous technology.
background	2 They have been successfully used in various application areas and in future computing environments, WSNs will play an increasingly important role.
background	3 However, programming sensor networks and applications to be deployed in them is extremely challenging.
background	4 It has traditionally been an error-prone task since it requires programming individual nodes, using low-level programming issues and interfacing with the hardware and the network.
background	5 This aspect is currently changing as different high-level programming abstractions and middleware solutions are coming into the arena.
other	6 Nevertheless, many research challenges are still open.
objective	7 This paper presents a survey of the current state-of-the-art in the field, establishing a classification and highlighting some likely research challenges and future directions.

background	1 Most people use Facebook on a daily basis; few are aware of the consequences.
result	2 Based on a 1-week experiment with 1,095 participants in late 2015 in Denmark, this study provides causal evidence that Facebook use affects our well-being negatively.
method	3 By comparing the treatment group (participants who took a break from Facebook) with the control group (participants who kept using Facebook), it was demonstrated that taking a break from Facebook has positive effects on the two dimensions of well-being: our life satisfaction increases and our emotions become more positive.
result	4 Furthermore, it was demonstrated that these effects were significantly greater for heavy Facebook users, passive Facebook users, and users who tend to envy others on Facebook.

objective	1 Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values.
objective	2 In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a.
result	3 , informative missingness.
method	4 There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.
method	5 In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts.
method	6 GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network.
method	7 It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results.
result	8 Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.

objective	1 The goal of this paper is to serve as a guide for selecting a detection architecture that achieves the right speed/memory/accuracy balance for a given application and platform.
objective	2 To this end, we investigate various ways to trade accuracy for speed and memory usage in modern convolutional object detection systems.
method	3 A number of successful systems have been proposed in recent years, but apples-toapples comparisons are difficult due to different base feature extractors (e.g., VGG, Residual Networks), different default image resolutions, as well as different hardware and software platforms.
method	4 We present a unified implementation of the Faster R-CNN [30], R-FCN [6] and SSD [25] systems, which we view as meta-architectures and trace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternative feature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image size within each of these meta-architectures.
method	5 On one extreme end of this spectrum where speed and memory are critical, we present a detector that achieves real time speeds and can be deployed on a mobile device.
result	6 On the opposite end in which accuracy is critical, we present a detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance measured on the COCO detection task.

background	1 Gamification, an emerging idea for using game design elements and principles to make everyday tasks more engaging, is permeating many different types of information systems.
background	2 Excitement surrounding gamification results from its many potential organizational benefits.
background	3 However, few research and design guidelines exist regarding gamified information systems.
objective	4 We therefore write this commentary to call upon information systems scholars to investigate the design and use of gamified information systems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theories, including behavioral economics, psychology, social psychology, information systems, etc.
method	5 We first explicate the idea of gamified information systems, provide real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful systems, and, based on a synthesis of the available literature, present a taxonomy of gamification design elements.
method	6 We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes.
method	7 Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas.
result	8 We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.

background	1 The growing power of bloggers to influence their connected network has emerged as a new communication venue for brands.
objective	2 This study elaborates upon the role of bloggers in brand communication, and reveals how brands can engage with bloggers, currently considered as online opinion leaders, from the perspective of the two-step flow theory.
method	3 Following clarification of the aims of the study, we report on in-depth interviews with 17 brand and digital agency representatives, selected because they regard communication with bloggers as an important strategy in increasing the influence of their brands among online communities.
method	4 This exploratory study reflects current blogger communication implementations, and concludes with a discussion of seven major issues arising from the literature review and interviews (definition of bloggers, blogger selection criteria, digital integration, power of bloggers, long-term relationship building with bloggers, measurement, and budgetary issues in blogger communication).
objective	5 These areas represent relatively unexplored areas of blogger engagement from both an academic and managerial perspective.
method	6 Based on the findings of the interviews, we propose a model which traces the influencer role of bloggers from the two-step flow theory perspective.
method	7 This model is named as the brand communication through digital influencers model.

background	1 Previous work has used monolingual parallel corpora to extract and generate paraphrases.
method	2 We show that this task can be done using bilingual parallel corpora, a much more commonly available resource.
method	3 Using alignment techniques from phrasebased statistical machine translation, we show how paraphrases in one language can be identified using a phrase in another language as a pivot.
method	4 We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account.
result	5 We evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments, and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments.

background	1 Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care.
background	2 Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured.
method	3 Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them.
result	4 There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge.
method	5 The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data.
method	6 In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain.
method	7 Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health.
result	8 However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists.
method	9 We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.

objective	3 In this paper we present an overview of the design and implementation of WHOPR and present results of its behavior when optimizing large applications.
method	4 We compare WHOPR’s compile time, memory usage, and code quality to the results of the classical file-byfile optimization model, focusing on its effects on GCC itself and the Firefox web browser.
result	5 We examine critical issues which arise only when considering large applications, such as startup time and code size growth.

background	1 In this study we investigate how social media shape the networked public sphere and facilitate communication between communities with different political orientations.
result	2 We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections.
method	3 Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between leftand right-leaning users.
method	4 Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets.
background	5 To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users.
result	6 We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis.

objective	1 This paper describes the configuration of a floor-tile installation robot for commercial buildings.
objective	2 The research is motivated by the need to reduce the installation time and cost while guaranteeing consistent quality.
objective	3 In order to compete with human installation, a time of 24 seconds per installed tile has to be matched.
method	4 The technical solution that is deemed feasible and capable of reducing this time to about 10 seconds, is an autonomous, electrically-powered mobile robot with omni-directional locomotive capability, and stereo cameras and light-striper for sensing.
method	5 High resolution imaging is needed to identify tile seams and edges, assess the quality of automatic installation, and locate where the next tile should be placed.
method	6 A mechanically compliant placement device would place the tile quickly and accurately without damaging the placed and surrounding tiles, emulating a human capability.
method	7 Vinyl/ceramic tiles, adhesives, and grout are carried onboard the robot and replenished by the operator.
method	8 Navigation and positioning are performed through a laserbased triangulation system, and by detecting, counting and dead-reckoning off of tiles placed on the floor.
result	9 Tile and installation quality are continuously monitored and errors corrected for, based on an overall layout map.

background	1 This technical note describes a new baseline for the Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019).
background	2 Our model is based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and reduces the gap between the model F1 scores reported in the original dataset paper and the human upper bound by 30% and 50% relative for the long and short answer tasks respectively.
objective	3 This baseline has been submitted to the official NQ leaderboard and we plan to opensource the code for it in the near future.

background	1 A memory-based learning system is an extended memory management system that decomposes the input space either statically or dynamically into subregions for the purpose of storing and retrieving functional information.
background	2 The main generalization techniques employed by memory-based learning systems are the nearest-neighbor search, space decomposition techniques, and clustering.
background	3 Research on memory-based learning is still in its early stage.
background	4 In particular, there are very few rigorous theoretical results regarding memory requirement, sample size, expected performance, and computational complexity.
objective	5 In this paper, we propose a model for memory-based learning and use it to analyze several methods— ε-covering, hashing, clustering, tree-structured clustering, and receptive-fields—for learning smooth functions.
method	6 The sample size and system complexity are derived for each method.
method	7 Our model is built upon the generalized PAC learning model of Haussler
result	8 (Haussler, 1989) and is closely related to the method of vector quantization in data compression.
result	9 Our main result is that we can build memory-based learning systems using new clustering algorithms (Lin & Vitter, 1992a) to PAC-learn in polynomial time using only polynomial storage in typical situations.

background	1 The use of the Internet by older adults is growing at a substantial rate.
background	2 They are becoming an increasingly important potential market for electronic commerce.
background	3 However, previous researchers and practitioners have focused mainly on the youth market and paid less attention to issues related to the online behaviors of older consumers.
result	4 To bridge the gap, the purpose of this study is to increase a better understanding of the drivers and barriers affecting older consumers’ intention to shop online.
objective	5 To this end, this study is developed by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and innovation resistance theory.
result	6 By comparing younger consumers with their older counterparts, in terms of gender the findings indicate that the major factors driving older adults toward online shopping are performance expectation and social influence which is the same with younger.
result	7 On the other hand, the major barriers include value, risk, and tradition which is different from younger.
result	8 Consequently, it is notable that older adults show no gender differences in regards to the drivers and barriers.

background	1 This study captures the state of current satellite transponder technology, specifically, solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) and traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), and describes expected future advances, including GaN SSPAs.
background	2 The findings of five previous SSPA and TWTA studies, including the 1991 European Space and Technology Center study, the 1993 National Aeronautics and Space Administration study, and three Boeing studies conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2013, are tabulated and summarized.
background	3 The results of these studies are then compared with new analyses of two validated sources of amplifier data: a commercially licensed database, Seradata’s Spacetrak, and a publicly available database, Gunter’s Space Page.
result	4 The new analyses consider a total of 18,902 amplifiers (6428 TWTAs, 2158 SSPAs, and 10,316 unspecified amplifiers) onboard 565 communications satellites launched from 1982 to 2016.
result	5 This new study contains the largest number of satellites and amplifiers to date and compares output power, redundancy, and bandwidth capabilities.
result	6 We find an increase in output power from the 1993 study of >200% for Ku-band TWTAs and C-band SSPAs, and >1000% increase for C-band TWTAs.
result	7 The ratio of operational to redundant amplifiers is 10 times higher for TWTAs than SSPAs, and the majority of amplifiers over the past 30 years operate with bandwidth less than 100MHz.
result	8 A second analysis is conducted using failure records and telemetry of 16 geostationary satellites equipped with 659 amplifiers: 535 SSPAs and 124 TWTAs.
result	9 We find that <2% of TWTAs and 5% of SSPAs experience anomalies.
objective	10 Overall, this research was performed to update and clarify how the power and bandwidth needs and redundancy trends of the SatCom community have evolved over the past 30 years.

objective	1 Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities.
background	2 In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings.
background	3 Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity.
background	4 We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space.
background	5 In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling.
method	6 In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces.
method	7 Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities.
result	8 In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction.
result	9 Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to stateof-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH. The source code of this paper can be obtained from https: //github.com/mrlyk423/relation extraction.

background	1 Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values of a target variable.
background	2 When this variable is nominal we have a problem of class imbalance that was already studied thoroughly within machine learning.
background	3 For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem.
result	4 Still, important application areas involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.
other	5 This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks.
other	6 Namely, we propose to address such tasks by sampling approaches.
result	7 These approaches change the distribution of the given training data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones.
result	8 We present a modification of the well-known Smote algorithm that allows its use on these regression tasks.
result	9 In an extensive set of experiments we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks.
result	10 The proposed SmoteR method can be used with any existing regression algorithm turning it into a general tool for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.

other	2 The challenge has shifted from collecting a sufficient amount of data to analyzing and making decisions based on the huge amount of data available.
result	3 Data analytics (DA) can help understand and gain insights from the big data and in turn help advance towards the vision of smart manufacturing.

background	5 E-mail address: rebecca.brand@villanova.edu (R.J. Attractive people are considered by others to have many positive qualities and in the case of social skills and intelligence, these attributions are often true.
background	6 In internet dating, individuals with attractive profile photos are viewed more favorably overall, but no research has yet established whether they indeed have more positive qualities.
method	7 We addressed this issue by having 50 women independently rate 100 photos and free-written texts taken from males’ profiles on a popular dating website.
method	8 Photos rated as physically attractive had profile texts that were rated as more attractive, even though photos and texts were rated by different judges.
method	9 Perceived confidence seemed to play a mediating role, suggesting that attractive men write appealing texts because they are aware of their high mate value.
other	10 Thus, contrary to popular belief, the internet does not seem to ‘‘level the playing field.

background	1 Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where a number of evaluators are presented with an interface design and asked to comment on it.
background	2 Four experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51% of the usability problems in the interfaces they evaluated.
result	3 On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.

background	1 Advanced mobile technology continues to shape professional environments.
background	2 Smart cell phones, pocket computers and laptop computers reduce the need of users to remain close to a wired information system infrastructure and allow for task performance in many different contexts.
objective	3 Among the consequences are changes in technology requirements, such as the need to limit weight and size of the devices.
method	4 In the current paper, we focus on the factors that users find important in mobile devices.
method	5 Based on a content analysis of online user reviews that was followed by structural equation modeling, we found four factors to be significantly related with overall user evaluation, namely functionality, portability, performance, and usability.
method	6 Besides the practical relevance for technology developers and managers, our research results contribute to the discussion about the extent to which previously established theories of technology adoption and use are applicable to mobile technology.
result	7 We also discuss the methodological suitability of online user reviews for the assessment of user requirements, and the complementarity of automated and non-automated forms of content analysis.

background	1 Big Data governance requires a data governance that can satisfy the needs for corporate governance, IT governance, and ITA/EA.
background	2 While the existing data governance focuses on the processing of structured data, Big Data governance needs to be established in consideration of a broad sense of Big Data services including unstructured data.
objective	3 To achieve the goals of Big Data, strategies need to be established together with goals that are aligned with the vision and objective of an organization.
method	4 In addition to the preparation of the IT infrastructure, a proper preparation of the components is required to effectively implement the strategy for Big Data services.
method	5 We propose the Big Data Governance Framework in this paper.
method	6 The Big Data governance framework presents criteria different from existing criteria at the data quality level.
method	7 It focuses on timely, reliable, meaningful, and sufficient data services, focusing on what data attributes should be achieved based on the data attributes of Big Data services.
method	8 In addition to the quality level of Big Data, the personal information protection strategy and the data disclosure/accountability strategy are also needed to achieve goals and to prevent problems.
method	9 This paper performed case analysis based on the Big Data Governance Framework with the National Pension Service of South Korea.
background	10 Big Data services in the public sector are an inevitable choice to improve the quality of people's life.

background	1 A systematic theory is introduced for finding the derivatives of complex-valued matrix functions with respect to a complex-valued matrix variable and the complex conjugate of this variable.
background	2 In the framework introduced, the differential of the complex-valued matrix function is used to identify the derivatives of this function.
result	3 Matrix differentiation results are derived and summarized in tables which can be exploited in a wide range of signal processing related situations

background	1 3D face reconstruction is a fundamental Computer Vision problem of extraordinary difficulty.
background	2 Current systems often assume the availability of multiple facial images (sometimes from the same subject) as input, and must address a number of methodological challenges such as establishing dense correspondences across large facial poses, expressions, and non-uniform illumination.
background	3 In general these methods require complex and inefficient pipelines for model building and fitting.
objective	4 In this work, we propose to address many of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans.
objective	5 Our CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accurate alignment nor establishes dense correspondence between images, works for arbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the whole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face) bypassing the construction (during training) and fitting (during testing) of a 3D Morphable Model.
result	6 We achieve this via a simple CNN architecture that performs direct regression of a volumetric representation of the 3D facial geometry from a single 2D image.
result	7 We also demonstrate how the related task of facial landmark localization can be incorporated into the proposed framework and help improve reconstruction quality, especially for the cases of large poses and facial expressions.

background	1 E-government research has become a recognized research domain and many policies and strategies are formulated for e-government implementations.
background	2 Most of these target the next few years and limited attention has been giving to the long term.
background	3 The eGovRTD2020, a European Commission co-funded project, investigated the future research on e-government driven by changing circumstances and the evolution of technology.
objective	4 This project consists of an analysis of the state of play, a scenario-building, a gap analysis and a roadmapping activity.
method	5 In this paper the roadmapping methodology fitting the unique characteristics of the e-government field is presented and the results are briefly discussed.
method	6 The use of this methodology has resulted in the identification of a large number of e-government research themes.
method	7 It was found that a roadmapping methodology should match the unique characteristics of e-government.
result	8 The research shows the need of multidisciplinary research.

background	1 With the spread of data mining technologies and the accumulation of social data, such technologies and data are being used for determinations that seriously affect individuals’ lives.
background	2 For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques.
background	3 Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on.
objective	4 Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination.
method	5 They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information.
result	6 In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning.
method	7 We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models.
method	8 We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.

background	1 Aesthetic seems currently under represented in most current data visualization evaluation methodologies.
objective	2 This paper investigates the results of an online survey of 285 participants, measuring both perceived aesthetic as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieval tasks across a set of 11 different data visualization techniques.
result	3 The data visualizations represent an identical hierarchical dataset, which has been normalized in terms of color, typography and layout balance.
method	4 This study measured parameters such as speed of completion, accuracy rate, task abandonment and latency of erroneous response.
result	5 Our findings demonstrate a correlation between latency in task abandonment and erroneous response time in relation to visualization's perceived aesthetic.
result	6 These results support the need for an increased recognition for aesthetic in the typical evaluation process of data visualization techniques.

objective	1 In this paper, a deep neural network (Behavior-CNN) is proposed to model pedestrian behaviors in crowded scenes, which has many applications in surveillance.
method	2 A pedestrian behavior encoding scheme is designed to provide a general representation of walking paths, which can be used as the input and output of CNN.
method	3 The proposed Behavior-CNN is trained with real-scene crowd data and then thoroughly investigated from multiple aspects, including the location map and location awareness property, semantic meanings of learned filters, and the influence of receptive fields on behavior modeling.
result	4 Multiple applications, including walking path prediction, destination prediction, and tracking, demonstrate the effectiveness of Behavior-CNN on pedestrian behavior modeling.

background	1 A different paradigm is needed for real-time command and control (C&C) problems.
background	2 Past approaches, using multiprocessors (MP), for real-time computing have had great difficulty in meeting real problem requirements.
background	3 We review some reasons why C&C problems that require a solution on a MP architecture may be intractable, and then show an architecture where these reasons for intractability are nonexistent.
method	4 We describe a polynomial time solution to the air traffic control (ATC) problem, which is a typical C&C problem.
method	5 This solution uses a static, non-preemptive table driven schedule using a SIMD architecture called an associative processor (AP).
result	6 The AP is an ideal processor for set and database operations since its single thread instruction stream can operate on an entire set of data with each instruction.
result	7 The AP eliminates multi-thread instructions, which account for much of the MP intractability mentioned above.

background	1 This paper introduces a novel algorithm that increases the efficiency of the current cloud-based smart-parking system and develops a network architecture based on the Internet-of-Things technology.
background	2 This paper proposed a system that helps users automatically find a free parking space at the least cost based on new performance metrics to calculate the user parking cost by considering the distance and the total number of free places in each car park.
background	3 This cost will be used to offer a solution of finding an available parking space upon a request by the user and a solution of suggesting a new car park if the current car park is full.
objective	4 The simulation results show that the algorithm helps improve the probability of successful parking and minimizes the user waiting time.
result	5 We also successfully implemented the proposed system in the real world.

background	1 The topic of cyber warfare is a vast one, with numerous sub topics receiving attention from the research community.
background	2 We first examine the most basic question of what cyber warfare is, comparing existing definitions to find common ground or disagreements.
background	3 We discover that there is no widely adopted definition and that the terms cyber war and cyber warfare are not well enough differentiated.
method	4 To address these issues, we present a definition model to help define both cyber warfare and cyber war.
method	5 The paper then identifies nine research challenges in cyber warfare and analyses contemporary work carried out in each.
background	6 We conclude by making suggestions on how the field may best be progressed by future efforts.

background	1 Industry 4.0 stands for the 4 Industrial revolution and the new paradigm of autonomous and decentralized control in production.
background	2 Products and production systems are enhanced to Cyber Physical Systems which have the capability to communicate with each other, to build ad-hoc networks and for self-control and self-optimization.
background	3 From the IT-perspective this involves a new level of networking, data integration and data processing in production.
background	4 Established technologies like Internet of Things, Cloud or Big Data are propagated solution-components of Industry 4.0.
background	5 So far, there is no founded elaboration of IT-requirements and no differentiated discussion on how solution-components fulfil these requirements.
method	6 This research uses the method of content analysis to extract requirements of Industry 4.0 from current research publications.
objective	7 Objective of analysis is a structured compilation of requirements regarding data processing.
method	8 The resulting category scheme enables further development of solution-components in the application domain of Industry 4.0.
result	9 Furthermore, this paper shows how the requirements can be matched to the capabilities of Big Data software solutions.
result	10 As a result, two general use cases for Big Data applications in Industry 4.0 were identified and characterized.

background	1 Improvement of traffic safety by cooperative vehicular applications is one of the most promising benefits of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
background	2 However, to properly develop such applications, the influence of different driving parameters on the event of vehicle collision must be assessed at an early design stage.
objective	3 In this paper, we derive a stochastic model for the number of accidents in a platoon of vehicles equipped with a warning collision notification system, which is able to inform all the vehicles about an emergency event.
method	4 In fact, the assumption of communications being used is key to simplify the derivation of a stochastic model.
method	5 The model enables the computation of the average number of collisions that occur in the platoon, the probabilities of the different ways in which the collisions may take place, as well as other statistics of interest.
method	6 Although an exponential distribution has been used for the traffic density, it is also valid for different probability distributions for traffic densities, as well as for other significant parameters of the model.
method	7 Moreover, the actual communication system employed is independent of the model since it is abstracted by a message delay variable, which allows it to be used to evaluate different communication technologies.
result	8 We validate the proposed model with Monte Carlo simulations.
result	9 With this model, one can quickly evaluate numerically the influence of different model parameters (vehicle density, velocities, decelerations, and delays) on the collision process and draw conclusions that shed relevant guidelines for the design of vehicular communication systems, as well as chain collision avoidance applications.
result	10 Illustrative examples of application are provided, although a systematic characterization and evaluation of different scenarios is left as future work.

background	4 ‘‘If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
result	5 ’’ and, paraphrasing the proverbial philosophy question, if a company has a strong CSR commitment but nobody recognizes it, does it produce any benefits?
background	6 Business returns from corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, such as customers loyalty and company reputation, depend heavily on how stakeholders perceive the company social behavior, making the measure of stakeholder perception a key issue in the process of CSR assessment.
objective	7 In this paper the analysis of CSR activities, as perceived by stakeholders, is realized utilizing global reporting initiative (GRI) indicators structured under balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives and sustainability dimensions.
method	8 We utilize a multi-criteria approach combined with fuzzy linguistic variables, in the variation of the 2-tuple, creating a hierarchy of CSR components with the purpose of integrating financial and non-financial sustainability dimensions and strategic perspectives.
result	9 The hierarchy provides a multidimensional model that allows to evaluate the multifaceted social behavior of a company: the same company can be perceived simultaneously as responsible or irresponsible depending on the considered dimension and perspective.

background	1 User satisfaction with information systems (IS) is considered an important indicator of information systems success and has been the subject of numerous research studies since the field’s inception.
objective	2 In this paper, we review the user satisfaction research in the IS field.
method	3 We discuss the roots of user satisfaction research as it pertains to satisfaction studies in marketing research and how these studies have been used to inform the IS context.

background	1 This paper describes the implementation of an attack on the Bluetooth security mechanism.
method	2 Specifically, we describe a passive attack, in which an attacker can find the PIN used during the pairing process.
method	3 We then describe the cracking speed we can achieve through three optimizations methods.
method	4 Our fastest optimization employs an algebraic representation of a central cryptographic primitive (SAFER+) used in Bluetooth.
result	5 Our results show that a 4-digit PIN can be cracked in less than 0.3 sec on an old Pentium III 450MHz computer, and in 0.06 sec on a Pentium IV 3Ghz HT computer.

background	1 A new musical instrument classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented in this paper.
method	2 Unlike the traditional methods, we investigated a scheme for classifying musical instruments using the learned features from CNNs.
method	3 To create the learned features from CNNs, we not only used a conventional spectrogram image, but also proposed multiresolution recurrence plots (MRPs) that contain the phase information of a raw input signal.
method	4 Consequently, we fed the characteristic timbre of the particular instrument into a neural network, which cannot be extracted using a phase-blinded representations such as a spectrogram.
result	5 By combining our proposed MRPs and spectrogram images with a multi-column network, the performance of our proposed classifier system improves over a system that uses only a spectrogram.
result	6 Furthermore, the proposed classifier also outperforms the baseline result from traditional handcrafted features and classifiers.

background	1 We present an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving optimization problems with an ℓ1 regularized least-squares cost function subject to recursive equality constraints.
method	2 The considered optimization problem has applications in control, for example in ℓ1 regularized MPC.
method	3 The ADMM algorithm is easy to implement, converges fast to a solution of moderate accuracy, and enables separation of the optimization problem into sub-problems that may be solved in parallel.
method	4 We show that the most costly step of the proposed ADMM algorithm is equivalent to solving an LQ regulator problem with an extra linear term in the cost function, a problem that can be solved efficiently using a Riccati recursion.
method	5 We apply the ADMM algorithm to an example of ℓ1 regularized MPC.
result	6 The numerical examples confirm fast convergence to sufficient accuracy and a linear complexity in the MPC prediction horizon.

background	1 Information technology should have much to offer linguistics, not only through the opportunities offered by large-scale data analysis and the stimulus to develop formal computational models, but through the chance to use language in systems for automatic natural language processing.
background	2 The paper discusses these possibilities in detail, and then examines the actual work that has been done.
objective	3 It is evident that this has so far been primarily research within a new field, computational linguistics, which is largely motivated by the demands, and interest, of practical processing systems, and that information technology has had rather little influence on linguistics at large.
objective	4 There are different reasons for this, and not all good ones: information technology deserves more attention from linguists.

background	1 We consider learning representations of entities and relations in KBs using the neural-embedding approach.
objective	2 We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a unified learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions.
method	3 Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task.
method	4 We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2% vs. 54.7% by TransE on Freebase).
method	5 Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as BornInCitypa, bq ^ CityInCountrypb, cq ùñ Nationalitypa, cq.
result	6 We find that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics, and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication.
result	7 More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-ofthe-art confidence-based rule mining approach in mining horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.

objective	3 Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to calculate the average coding efficiency based on subjective quality scores, i.e., mean opinion scores (MOS).
method	4 We call this approach Subjective Comparison of ENcoders based on fItted Curves (SCENIC).
method	5 To consider the intrinsic nature of bounded rating scales, a logistic function is used to fit the rate-distortion (R-D) values.
method	6 The average MOS and bit rate differences are computed between the fitted R-D curves.
method	7 The statistical property of subjective scores is considered to estimate corresponding confidence intervals on the calculated average MOS and bit rate differences.
result	8 The proposed model is expected to report more realistic coding efficiency as PSNR is not always correlated with perceived visual quality.

objective	1 This paper discusses empirical and analytical rules to select a suitable grid resolution for output maps and based on the inherent properties of the input data.
background	2 The choice of grid resolution was related with the cartographic and statistical concepts: scale, computer processing power, positional accuracy, size of delineations, inspection density, spatial autocorrelation structure and complexity of terrain.
method	3 These were further related with the concepts from the general statistics and information theory such as Nyquist frequency concept from signal processing and equations to estimate the probability density function.
method	4 Selection of grid resolution was demonstrated using four datasets: (1) GPS positioning data— the grid resolution was related to the area of circle described by the error radius, (2) map of agricultural plots—the grid resolution was related to the size of smallest and narrowest plots, (3) point dataset from soil mapping—the grid resolution was related to the inspection density, nugget variation and range of spatial autocorrelation and (4) contour map used for production of digital elevation model—the grid resolution was related with the spacing between the contour lines i.e. complexity of terrain.
method	5 It was concluded that no ideal grid resolution exists, but rather a range of suitable resolutions.
method	6 One should at least try to avoid using resolutions that do not comply with the effective scale or inherent properties of the input dataset.
method	7 Three standard grid resolutions for output maps were finally recommended: (a) the coarsest legible grid resolution—this is the largest resolution that we should use in order to respect the scale of work and properties of a dataset; (b) the finest legible grid resolution—this is the smallest grid resolution that represents 95% of spatial objects or topography; and (c) recommended grid resolution—a compromise between the two.
objective	8 Objective procedures to derive the true optimal grid resolution that maximizes the predictive capabilities or information content of a map are further discussed.
method	9 This methodology can now be integrated within a GIS package to help inexperienced users select a suitable grid resolution without doing extensive data preprocessing.

background	1 The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neura l networks, in particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks.
background	2 However , these architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional n etworks which are very successful in computer vision.
background	3 We present a new archite ctur for text processing which operates directly on the character level and uses o nly small convolutions and pooling operations.
objective	4 We are able to show that the performa nce of this model increases with the depth: using up to 29 convolutional layer s, we report significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public t ext classification tasks.
result	5 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that very de ep convolutional nets have been applied to NLP.

background	1 Bitcoin cryptocurrency demonstrated the utility of global consensus across thousands of nodes, changing the world of digital transactions forever.
background	2 In the early days of Bitcoin, the performance of its probabilistic proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus fabric, also known as blockchain, was not a major issue.
background	3 Bitcoin became a success story, despite its consensus latencies on the order of an hour and the theoretical peak throughput of only up to 7 transactions per second.
background	4 The situation today is radically different and the poor performance scalability of early PoW blockchains no longer makes sense.
method	5 Specifically, the trend of modern cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, is to support execution of arbitrary distributed applications on blockchain fabric, needing much better performance.
background	6 This approach, however, makes cryptocurrency platforms step away from their original purpose and enter the domain of database-replication protocols, notably, the classical state-machine replication, and in particular its Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) variants.
method	7 In this paper, we contrast PoW-based blockchains to those based on BFT state machine replication, focusing on their scalability limits.
method	8 We also discuss recent proposals to overcoming these scalability limits and outline key outstanding open problems in the quest for the “ultimate” blockchain fabric(s).

background	2 Given these devastating effects, there is an increasing interest in developing measures in order to diminish the possible impact of disasters, which gave rise to the field of disaster operations management (DOM).
background	3 In this paper we review recent OR/MS research in DOM.
background	4 Our work is a continuation of a previous review from Altay and Green (2006).
objective	5 Our purpose is to evaluate how OR/MS research in DOM has evolved in the last years and to what extent the gaps identified by Altay and Green (2006) have been covered.
background	6 Our findings show no drastic changes or developments in the field of OR/MS in DOM since the publication of Altay and Green (2006).
method	7 Additionally to our comparative analysis, we present an original evaluation about the most common assumptions in recent OR/MS literature in DOM.
result	8 Based on our findings we provide future research directions in order to make improvements in the areas where lack of research is detected.

background	1 The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data.
method	2 Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors.
method	3 This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks.
method	4 This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.

background	1 The wound healing assay in vitro is widely used for research and discovery in biology and medicine.
background	2 This assay allows for observing the healing process in vitro in which the cells on the edges of the artificial wound migrate toward the wound area.
background	3 The influence of different culture conditions can be measured by observing the change in the size of the wound area.
background	4 For further investigation, more detailed measurements of the cell behaviors are required.
method	5 In this paper, we present an application of automatic cell tracking in phase-contrast microscopy images to wound healing assay.
method	6 The cell behaviors under three different culture conditions have been analyzed.

objective	2 Email: harshitg@gatech.edu Summary Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object (eg, smart cameras, wearable, environmental sensors, home appliances, and vehicles) online, hence generating massive volume of data that can overwhelm storage systems and data analytics applications.
objective	3 Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements.
objective	4 However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay that is caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances.
method	5 To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion.
method	6 To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed.
method	7 The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput.
method	8 To this end, we need an evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner.
result	9 In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost.
method	10 We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies.

background	1 Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models.
background	2 Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complexmodels.
background	3 This class ofMCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available.

background	5 Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code.
method	6 The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model.

background	1 Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classification and regression analysis due to their solid mathematical foundations, which include two desirable properties: margin maximization and nonlinear classification using kernels.
background	2 However, despite these prominent properties, SVMs are usually not chosen for large-scale data mining problems because their training complexity is highly dependent on the data set size.
method	3 Unlike traditional pattern recognition and machine learning, real-world data mining applications often involve huge numbers of data records.
background	4 Thus it is too expensive to perform multiple scans on the entire data set, and it is also infeasible to put the data set in memory.
background	5 This paper presents a method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), that maximizes the SVM performance for very large data sets given a limited amount of resource, e.g., memory.
result	6 CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples.
result	7 These samples carry statistical summaries of the data and maximize the benefit of learning.
result	8 Our analyses show that the training complexity of CB-SVM is quadratically dependent on the number of support vectors, which is usually much less than that of the entire data set.
other	9 Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets and very accurate in terms of classification.

method	1 Automatic detection of pavement cracks is an important task in transportation maintenance for driving safety assurance.
objective	2 However, it remains a challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background, e.g., the low contrast with surrounding pavement and possible shadows with similar intensity.
background	3 Inspired by recent success on applying deep learning to computer vision and medical problems, a deep-learning based method for crack detection is proposed in this paper.
result	4 A supervised deep convolutional neural network is trained to classify each image patch in the collected images.
result	5 Quantitative evaluation conducted on a data set of 500 images of size 3264 χ 2448, collected by a low-cost smart phone, demonstrates that the learned deep features with the proposed deep learning framework provide superior crack detection performance when compared with features extracted with existing hand-craft methods.

background	1 ÐHidden Markov models (HMMs) are stochastic models capable of statistical learning and classification.
background	2 They have been applied in speech recognition and handwriting recognition because of their great adaptability and versatility in handling sequential signals.
background	3 On the other hand, as these models have a complex structure and also because the involved data sets usually contain uncertainty, it is difficult to analyze the multiple observation training problem without certain assumptions.
background	4 For many years researchers have used Levinson's training equations in speech and handwriting applications, simply assuming that all observations are independent of each other.
objective	5 This paper presents a formal treatment of HMM multiple observation training without imposing the above assumption.
method	6 In this treatment, the multiple observation probability is expressed as a combination of individual observation probabilities without losing generality.
method	7 This combinatorial method gives one more freedom in making different dependence-independence assumptions.
method	8 By generalizing Baum's auxiliary function into this framework and building up an associated objective function using the Lagrange multiplier method, it is proven that the derived training equations guarantee the maximization of the objective function.
result	9 Furthermore, we show that Levinson's training equations can be easily derived as a special case in this treatment.

background	1 Mobile technology has become increasingly common in today’s everyday life.
background	2 However, mobile payment is surprisingly not among the frequently used mobile services, although technologically advanced solutions exist.
background	3 Apparently, there is still a lack of acceptance of mobile payment services among consumers.
method	4 The conceptual model developed and tested in this research thus focuses on factors determining consumers’ acceptance of mobile payment services.
result	5 The empirical results show particularly strong support for the effects of compatibility, individual mobility, and subjective norm.
result	6 Our study offers several implications for managers in regards to marketing mobile payment solutions to increase consumers’ intention to use these services.

background	1 Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs.
result	2 Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks.
background	3 Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively.
method	4 In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results.
method	5 Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected.
result	6 In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network.
result	7 We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features.
result	8 A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.

background	1 Computer graphics research has concentrated on creating photo-realistic images of synthetic objects.
objective	2 These images communicate surface shading and curvature, as well as the depth relationships of objects in a scene.
method	3 These renderings are traditionally represented by a rectangular array of pixels that tile the image plane.
method	4 As an alternative to photo-realism, it is possible to create abstract images using an ordered collection of brush strokes.
result	5 These abstract images filter and refine visual information before it is presented to the viewer.
result	6 By controlling the color, shape, size, and orientation of individual brush strokes, impressionistic paintings of computer generated or photographic images can easily be created.

background	1 Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs.
background	2 Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort.
background	3 With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features.
background	4 However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank.
objective	5 In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems.
method	6 We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps.
result	7 Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models.
result	8 We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.

objective	1 In this paper we discuss the development and use of low-rank approximate nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms for feature extraction and identification in the fields of text mining and spectral data analysis.
method	2 The evolution and convergence properties of hybrid methods based on both sparsity and smoothness constraints for the resulting nonnegative matrix factors are discussed.
result	3 The interpretability of NMF outputs in specific contexts are provided along with opportunities for future work in the modification of NMF algorithms for large-scale and time-varying datasets.

background	1 Bitcoins have recently become an increasingly popular cryptocurrency through which users trade electronically and more anonymously than via traditional electronic transfers.
background	2 Bitcoin’s design keeps all transactions in a public ledger.
background	3 The sender and receiver for each transaction are identified only by cryptographic publickey ids.
background	4 This leads to a common misconception that it inherently provides anonymous use.
background	5 While Bitcoin’s presumed anonymity offers new avenues for commerce, several recent studies raise user-privacy concerns.
objective	6 We explore the level of anonymity in the Bitcoin system.
method	7 Our approach is two-fold: (i) We annotate the public transaction graph by linking bitcoin public keys to real people either definitively or statistically.
method	8 (ii) We run the annotated graph through our graph-analysis framework to find and summarize activity of both known and unknown users.

background	1 Hardware technologies for trusted computing, or trusted execution environments (TEEs), have rapidly matured over the last decade.
background	2 In fact, TEEs are at the brink of widespread commoditization with the recent introduction of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX).
background	3 Despite such rapid development of TEE, software technologies for TEE significantly lag behind their hardware counterpart, and currently only a select group of researchers have the privilege of accessing this technology.
objective	4 To address this problem, we develop an open source platform, called OpenSGX, that emulates Intel SGX hardware components at the instruction level and provides new system software components necessarily required for full TEE exploration.
method	5 We expect that the OpenSGX framework can serve as an open platform for SGX research, with the following contributions.
method	6 First, we develop a fully functional, instruction-compatible emulator of Intel SGX for enabling the exploration of software/hardware design space, and development of enclave programs.
method	7 OpenSGX provides a platform for SGX development, meaning that it provides not just emulation but also operating system components, an enclave program loader/packager, an OpenSGX user library, debugging, and performance monitoring.
result	8 Second, to show OpenSGX’s use cases, we applied OpenSGX to protect sensitive information (e.g., directory) of Tor nodes and evaluated their potential performance impacts.
result	9 Therefore, we believe OpenSGX has great potential for broader communities to spark new research on soon-to-becommodity Intel SGX.

objective	1 This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification.
method	2 We constructed several largescale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results.
result	3 Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.

background	1 Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the emotional content of speech signals, and hence, many systems have been proposed to identify the emotional content of a spoken utterance.
background	2 This paper is a survey of speech emotion classification addressing three important aspects of the design of a speech emotion recognition system.
background	3 The first one is the choice of suitable features for speech representation.
background	4 The second issue is the design of an appropriate classification scheme and the third issue is the proper preparation of an emotional speech database for evaluating system performance.
background	5 Conclusions about the performance and limitations of current speech emotion recognition systems are discussed in the last section of this survey.
method	6 This section also suggests possible ways of improving speech emotion recognition systems.

background	1 Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep’s computation on the previous timestep’s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences.
method	2 We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels.
method	3 Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size.
result	4 Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time.
result	5 Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.

background	1 Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip.
background	2 Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user’s influence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing.
background	3 In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions.
objective	4 Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time.
method	5 We make several interesting observations.
objective	6 First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions.
result	7 Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics.
method	8 Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic.
result	9 We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.

background	1 Design thinking (DT) is regarded as a system of three overlapping spaces—viability, desirability, and feasibility—where innovation increases when all three perspectives are addressed.
background	2 Understanding how innovation within teams can be supported by DT methods and tools captivates the interest of business communities.
objective	3 This paper aims to examine how DT methods and tools foster innovation in teams.
result	4 A case study approach, based on two workshops, examined three DT methods with a software tool.
result	5 The findings support the use of DT methods and tools as a way of incubating ideas and creating innovative solutions within teams when team collaboration and software limitations are balanced.
result	6 The paper proposes guidelines for utilizing DT methods and tools in innovation

background	1 Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) models for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate.
background	2 Although significant effort has been dedicated to design and improve mobile models on all three dimensions, it is challenging to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider.
objective	3 In this paper, we propose an automated neural architecture search approach for designing resourceconstrained mobile CNN models.
objective	4 We propose to explicitly incorporate latency information into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency.
method	5 Unlike in previous work, where mobile latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), in our experiments, we directly measure real-world inference latency by executing the model on a particular platform, e.g., Pixel phones.
method	6 To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that permits layer diversity throughout the network.
result	7 Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks.
result	8 On the ImageNet classification task, our model achieves 74.0% top-1 accuracy with 76ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.5× faster than MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al. 2018) and 2.4× faster than NASNet (Zoph et al. 2018) with the same top-1 accuracy.
result	9 On the COCO object detection task, our model family achieves both higher mAP quality and lower latency than MobileNets.

background	1 This paper describes the implementation of general multibody system dynamics on Scissor lift Mechanism (i.e. four bar parallel mechanism) within a bond graph modeling framework.
method	2 Scissor lifting mechanism is the first choice for automobiles and industries for elevation work.
background	3 The system has a one degree of freedom.
method	4 There are several procedures for deriving dynamic equations of rigid bodies in classical mechanics (i.e. Classic Newton-D'Alembert, Newton-Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, kanes to name a few).
background	5 But these are labor-intensive for large and complicated systems thereby error prone.
method	6 Here the multibody dynamics model of the mechanism is developed in bond graph formalism because it offers flexibility for modeling of closed loop kinematic systems without any causal conflicts and control laws can be included.
method	7 In this work, the mechanism is modeled and simulated in order to evaluate several application-specific requirements such as dynamics, position accuracy etc.
method	8 The proposed multibody dynamics model of the mechanism offers an accurate and fast method to analyze the dynamics of the mechanism knowing that there is no such work available for scissor lifts.
result	9 The simulation gives a clear idea about motor torque sizing for different link lengths of the mechanism over a linear displacement.

background	1 Android is a modern and popular software platform for smartphones.
background	2 Among its predominant features is an advanced security model which is based on application-oriented mandatory access control and sandboxing.
background	3 This allows developers and users to restrict the execution of an application to the privileges it has (mandatorily) assigned at installation time.
background	4 The exploitation of vulnerabilities in program code is hence believed to be confined within the privilege boundaries of an application’s sandbox.
objective	5 However, in this paper we show that a privilege escalation attack is possible.
objective	6 We show that a genuine application exploited at runtime or a malicious application can escalate granted permissions.
result	7 Our results immediately imply that Android’s security model cannot deal with a transitive permission usage attack and Android’s sandbox model fails as a last resort against malware and sophisticated runtime attacks.

background	1 While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in single-label image classification, it is important to note that real world images generally contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image.
background	2 Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results.
method	3 These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image.
method	4 In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem.
method	5 Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework.
result	6 Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label classification models.

background	1 Biologists depend on visual representations, and their use of diagrams has drawn the attention of philosophers, historians, and sociologists interested in understanding how these images are involved in biological reasoning.
background	2 These studies, however, proceed from identification of diagrams on the basis of their spare visual appearance, and do not draw on a foundational theory of the nature of diagrams as representations.
background	3 This approach has limited the extent to which we understand how these diagrams are involved in biological reasoning.
objective	4 In this paper I characterize three different kinds of figures among those previously identified as diagrams.
objective	5 The features that make these figures distinctive as representational types, furthermore, illuminate the ways in which they are involved in biological reasoning.

background	1 Mobile robots with reconfigurable chassis are able to traverse unstructured outdoor environments with boulders or rubble, and overcome challenging structures in urban environments, like stairs or steps.
background	2 Autonomously traversing rough terrain and such obstacles while ensuring the safety of the robot is a challenging task in mobile robotics.
objective	3 In this paper we introduce a two-phase motion planning algorithm for actively reconfigurable tracked robots.
method	4 We first use the completeness of a graph search on a regular grid to quickly find an initial path in a low dimensional space, considering only the platform's operating limits instead of the complete state.
method	5 We then take this initial path to focus the RRT* search in the continuous high-dimensional state space including the actuators of the robot.
method	6 We do not rely on a detailed structure/terrain classification or use any predefined motion sequences.
method	7 Hence, our planner can be applied to urban structures, like stairs, as well as rough unstructured environments.
result	8 Simulation results prove our method to be effective in solving planning queries in such environments.

background	1 Backtracting is a well-known technique for solving combinatorial problems.
background	2 It is of interest to programming methodologists because (1) correctness of backtracking programs may be difficult to ascertain experimentally and (2) efficiency is often of paramount importance.
background	3 This paper applies a programming methodology, which we call control structure abstraction, to the backtracking technique.
method	4 The value of control structure abstraction in the context of correctness is that proofs of general properties of a class of programs with similar control structures are separated from proofs of specific properties of individual programs of the class.
method	5 In the context of efficiency, it provides sufficient conditions for correctness of an initial program which may subsequently be improved for efficiency while preserving correctness.

background	1 In recent years, a plethora of approaches have been proposed to deal with the increasingly challenging task of multi-output regression.
method	2 This paper provides a survey on state-of-the-art multi-output regression methods, that are categorized as problem transformation and algorithm adaptation methods.
method	3 In addition, we present the mostly used performance evaluation measures, publicly available data sets for multi-output regression real-world problems, as well as open-source software frameworks.

background	1 In today’s fast changing health care sector, decision makers are facing a growing demand for both clinical and administrative information in order to comply with legal and customer-specific requirements.
background	2 Performance Management (PM) is thus becoming increasingly important to catch up with the rising informational demands.
background	3 However, little is known about the PM usage in health care since the constituent research about PM is primarily focussed on the industrial sector.
method	4 For this purpose, an exploratory survey for the health care sector is presented.

background	1 This paper presents a filter-based control scheme for an H-Bridge inverter with output LC filter.
background	2 This approach relies only on a single output voltage measurement to reduce the system cost as well as measurement noise and disturbance injected by output current and/or inductor current measurements.
background	3 To reduce the controller sensitivity to the system parameters, the proposed controller is developed for unknown system parameters.
method	4 A Lyapunov stability analysis is utilized to demonstrate system stability.

objective	1 In this paper we address the problem of semantic labeling of indoor scenes on RGB-D data.
method	2 With the availability of RGB-D cameras, it is expected that additional depth measurement will improve the accuracy.
method	3 Here we investigate a solution how to incorporate complementary depth information into a semantic segmentation framework by making use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
method	4 Recently encoder-decoder type fully convolutional CNN architectures have achieved a great success in the field of semantic segmentation.
method	5 Motivated by this observation we propose an encoder-decoder type network, where the encoder part is composed of two branches of networks that simultaneously extract features from RGB and depth images and fuse depth features into the RGB feature maps as the network goes deeper.
result	6 Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed fusion-based architecture achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging SUN RGB-D benchmark obtaining 76.27% global accuracy, 48.30% average class accuracy and 37.29% average intersectionover-union score.

background	1 It is no secret that pornographic material is now a one-clickaway from everyone, including children and minors.
background	2 General social media networks are striving to isolate adult images and videos from normal ones.
background	3 Intelligent image analysis methods can help to automatically detect and isolate questionable images in media.
background	4 Unfortunately, these methods require vast experience to design the classifier including one or more of the popular computer vision feature descriptors.
method	5 We propose to build a classifier based on one of the recently flourishing deep learning techniques.
method	6 Convolutional neural networks contain many layers for both automatic features extraction and classification.
method	7 The benefit is an easier system to build (no need for hand-crafting features and classifiers).
result	8 Additionally, our experiments show that it is even more accurate than the state of the art methods on the most recent benchmark dataset.

background	1 Modern charging systems use user, network, and service related information when performing online charging.
background	2 Compared, however, to the overall information available and used in network management processes as a whole, charging systems only use a limited subset.
objective	3 This work is motivated by the challenge to identify which information is used, and how it is used in online charging related processes, and also to explore whether it could be utilized “better” or “smarter” to improve future online charging systems functionality.
objective	4 We do not attempt to predict which information will be utilized in such systems and for what purpose, but instead we summarize open issues in view of the emerging trend of exploiting the user, network and service related information in service provisioning.
method	5 We focus on the latest 3GPP standards and review relevant research papers, and propose three key aspects of online charging, with respect to information utilization: a) signaling aspect, b) inter-domain aspect, and c) serviceand component-based aspect.
method	6 We present a state of the art review by grouping the works found in the literature based on the aspects they are associated with, and compare them based on proposed comparison criteria.
result	7 The discussion presented at the end of the paper indicates three common open issues, namely: 1) lack of common charging information specification and structure, 2) lack of mechanisms for information sharing between stakeholders in the service delivery process, and 3) lack of a common framework for sharing information while protecting user privacy.

background	1 The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a significant role in patient care, especially at the early stage, because the consciousness of the severity and the progression risks allows the patients to take prevention measures before irreversible brain damages are shaped.
background	2 Although many studies have applied machine learning methods for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD recently, a bottleneck of the diagnosis performance was shown in most of the existing researches, mainly due to the congenital limitations of the chosen learning models.
method	3 In this study, we design a deep learning architecture, which contains stacked auto-encoders and a softmax output layer, to overcome the bottleneck and aid the diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
method	4 Compared to the previous workflows, our method is capable of analyzing multiple classes in one setting, and requires less labeled training samples and minimal domain prior knowledge.
result	5 A significant performance gain on classification of all diagnosis groups was achieved in our experiments.

background	1 Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive.
background	2 Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused.
method	3 We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run.
method	4 We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.1

background	1 Based on the real data of a Chinese commercial bank’s credit card, in this paper, we classify the credit card customers into four classifications by K-means.
method	2 Then we built forecasting models separately based on four data mining methods such as C5.0, neural network, chi-squared automatic interaction detector, and classification and regression tree according to the background information of the credit cards holders.
method	3 Conclusively, we obtain some useful information of decision tree regulation by the best model among the four.
result	4 The information is not only helpful for the bank to understand related characteristics of different customers, but also marketing representatives to find potential customers and to implement target marketing.

background	1 Over the last ten years, argumentation has come to be increasingly central as a core study within Artificial Intelligence (AI).
background	2 The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation.
objective	3 Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used.
method	4 We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship— in terms of both similarities and important differences—to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof.
method	5 We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume.

objective	1 This study investigates self-presentation strategies among online dating participants, exploring how participants manage their online presentation of self in order to accomplish the goal of finding a romantic partner.
background	2 Thirty-four individuals active on a large online dating site participated in telephone interviews about their online dating experiences and perceptions.
method	3 Qualitative data analysis suggests that participants attended to small cues online, mediated the tension between impression management pressures and the desire to present an authentic sense of self through tactics such as creating a profile that reflected their "ideal self," and attempted to establish the veracity of their identity claims.
result	4 This study provides empirical support for Social Information Processing theory in a naturalistic context while offering insight into the complicated way in which "honesty" is enacted online.

background	1 The widespread deployment and adoption of the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard is making Internet video-on-demand a `standard' Internet application similar in impact as email and web browsing.
background	2 While video streaming has been widely deployed and studied for decades, DASH-based streaming is very different as it involves adaptation both by the application and by TCP.
background	3 The dynamics and implications of multiple levels of end-to-end congestion control are not well understood.
objective	4 The contribution of the research presented in this paper is twofold: first, we characterize the bandwidth consumption of a widely deployed DASH application (i.e., Netflix); second, we provide insight in how different implementations and different access networks can impact bandwidth consumption.
result	5 Our results suggest that Netflix adaptation defaults to underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of heavy, sustained network congestion.
result	6 However, the application algorithm is clearly intertwined with the underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of volatile network conditions.
result	7 In one network scenario, we observed that a backlogged TCP flow achieved a throughput of 6 Mbps while a Netflix session (under similar path conditions) consumed less than 3 Mbps of bandwidth.

method	1 Applying uses and gratifications theory (UGT), this study examined consumers’ use of one of four social networking sites (SNSs): Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat, for following brands, and their influence on brand community-related outcomes.
result	2 Results (N = 297) indicated Snapchat users scored highest for passing time, sharing problems, and improving social knowledge, while Instagram users scored highest for showing affection, following fashion, and demonstrating sociability.
result	3 Twitter users had highest brand community identification and membership intention, while Instagram users had highest brand community engagement and commitment.
result	4 Attention to social comparison, SNS trust, tie strength, and homophily also significantly moderated the relationship between frequent use of each SNS to follow brands, and brand community-related outcomes.
result	5 Implications for future research on SNS users’ goal-directed consumption behaviors are discussed.

background	1 The e-commerce literature has rarely addressed the measurement of customer perceptions of website service quality in digital marketing environments.
background	2 It is argued that the current SERVQUAL and IS-SERVQUAL instruments need to be refined and validated to fit the digital marketing environment, as they are targeted primarily towards either traditional retailing or information systems contexts.
objective	3 This article validates and refines a comprehensive model and instrument for measuring customer-perceived service quality of websites that market digital products and services.
method	4 After a discussion of the conceptualization and operationalization of the service quality construct, the procedure used in modifying items, collecting data, and validating a multiple-item scale is described.
method	5 Subsequently, evidence of reliability and validity on the basis of analyzing data from a quota sample of 260 adult respondents is presented.
method	6 Implications for practice and research are then explored.
result	7 Finally, this paper concludes by discussing limitations that could be addressed in future studies.
result	8 The final EC-SERVQUAL instrument with good reliability and validity will be essential to the development and testing of e-business theories, and provide researchers with a common framework for explaining, justifying, and comparing differences across results.

background	1 Big data is big news, and large companies in all sectors are making significant advances in their customer relations, product selection and development and consequent profitability through using this valuable commodity.
background	2 Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have proved themselves to be slow adopters of the new technology of big data analytics and are in danger of being left behind.
background	3 In Europe, SMEs are a vital part of the economy, and the challenges they encounter need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
objective	4 This paper identifies barriers to SME uptake of big data analytics and recognises their complex challenge to all stakeholders, including national and international policy makers, IT, business management and data science communities.
objective	5 The paper proposes a big data maturity model for SMEs as a first step towards an SME roadmap to data analytics.
method	6 It considers the ‘state-of-the-art’ of IT with respect to usability and usefulness for SMEs and discusses how SMEs can overcome the barriers preventing them from adopting existing solutions.
method	7 The paper then considers management perspectives and the role of maturity models in enhancing and structuring the adoption of data analytics in an organisation.
method	8 The history of total quality management is reviewed to inform the core aspects of implanting a new paradigm.
result	9 The paper concludes with recommendations to help SMEs develop their big data capability and enable them to continue as the engines of European industrial and business success.

objective	1 We propose a sensor-driver integrated muscle module by integrating necessarily components for tendon-driven robot which is likely to complicate.
method	2 The module has abilities of high-tension measurability and flexible tension control.
method	3 In order to achieve flexible tension control, we developed the new tension measurement mechanism with high-tension measurability and the new motor driver which enables current based motor control.
result	4 We demonstrate the tension control ability of the module by several experiments.
result	5 Furthermore, utilizing the module advantage of design facilitation, we made two types of tendon-driven robots and confirmed effectiveness of the module.

background	1 This study examines the agenda-setting power of fake news and fact-checkers who fight them through a computational look at the online mediascape from 2014 to 2016.
background	2 Although our study confirms that content from fake news websites is increasing, these sites do not exert excessive power.
background	3 Instead, fake news has an intricately entwined relationship with online partisan media, both responding and setting its issue agenda.
background	4 In 2016, partisan media appeared to be especially susceptible to the agendas of fake news, perhaps due to the election.
background	5 Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree.
background	6 Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically.
background	7 While fact-checkers are autonomous in their selection of issues to cover, they were not influential in determining the agenda of news media overall, and their influence appears to be declining, illustrating the difficulties factcheckers face in disseminating their corrections.

background	1 Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world.
background	2 However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing.
background	3 Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence.
objective	4 This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field.
method	5 It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space.
method	6 A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli.
method	7 An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence.
result	8 Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.

background	1 Clustering is often an essential first step in data mining intended to reduce redundancy, or define data categories.
background	2 Hierarchical clustering, a widely used clustering technique, can offer a richer representation by suggesting the potential group structures.
background	3 However, parallelization of such an algorithm is challenging as it exhibits inherent data dependency during the hierarchical tree construction.
method	4 In this paper, we design a parallel implementation of Single-linkage Hierarchical Clustering by formulating it as a Minimum Spanning Tree problem.
method	5 We further show that Spark is a natural fit for the parallelization of single-linkage clustering algorithm due to its natural expression of iterative process.
method	6 Our algorithm can be deployed easily in Amazon's cloud environment.
result	7 And a thorough performance evaluation in Amazon's EC2 verifies that the scalability of our algorithm sustains when the datasets scale up.

background	1 We have entered the era of social media networks represented by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr.
background	2 Internet users now spend more time on social networks than search engines.
background	3 Business entities or public figures set up social networking pages to enhance direct interactions with online users.
background	4 Social media systems heavily depend on users for content contribution and sharing.
background	5 Information is spread across social networks quickly and effectively.
background	6 However, at the same time social media networks become susceptible to different types of unwanted and malicious spammer or hacker actions.
background	7 There is a crucial need in the society and industry for security solution in social media.
objective	8 In this demo, we propose SocialSpamGuard, a scalable and online social media spam detection system based on data mining for social network security.
method	9 We employ our GAD clustering algorithm for large scale clustering and integrate it with the designed active learning algorithm to deal with the scalability and real-time detection challenges.

background	1 A 12-bit low-power successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is presented using dynamic latch comparator to realize power consumption of 47.86μW under 1.8V supply voltage.
background	2 Fully differential structure and hybrid 9-bit charge-redistribution capacitive and 3-bit resistor string DAC techniques are adopted to achieve balance between high precision and small area.
background	3 Fabricated in SMIC 0.18-μm 1P6M mixed-signal CMOS technology, the ADC only occupies 0.39mm active area and the DNL/INL achieve 0.6LSB and 0.8LSB respectively.

background	1 In this paper, a power density analysis is presented for 7nm FinFET technology node based on both shorted-gate (SG) and independent-gate (IG) standard cells operating in multiple supply voltage regimes.
method	2 A Liberty-formatted standard cell library is established by selecting the appropriate number of fins for the pull-up and pull-down networks of each logic cell.
method	3 The layout of both shorted-gate and independent-gate standard cells are then characterized according to lambda-based layout design rules for FinFET devices.
method	4 Finally, the power density of 7nm FinFET technology node is analyzed and compared with the 45 nm CMOS technology node for different circuits.
result	5 Experimental result shows that the power density of each 7nm FinFET circuit is 3-20 times larger than that of 45nm CMOS circuit under the spacer-defined technology.
result	6 Experimental result also shows that the back-gate signal enables a better control of power consumption for independent-gate FinFETs.

background	1 We propose an efficient method to generate white-box adversarial examples to trick a character-level neural classifier.
background	2 We find that only a few manipulations are needed to greatly decrease the accuracy.
method	3 Our method relies on an atomic flip operation, which swaps one token for another, based on the gradients of the onehot input vectors.
method	4 Due to efficiency of our method, we can perform adversarial training which makes the model more robust to attacks at test time.
result	5 With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, we demonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier as well.

background	1 The standard training regime for transition-based dependency parsers makes use of an oracle, which predicts an optimal transition sequence for a sentence and its gold tree.
method	2 We present an improved oracle for the arc-eager transition system, which provides a set of optimal transitions for every valid parser configuration, including configurations from which the gold tree is not reachable.
method	3 In such cases, the oracle provides transitions that will lead to the best reachable tree from the given configuration.
method	4 The oracle is efficient to implement and provably correct.
method	5 We use the oracle to train a deterministic left-to-right dependency parser that is less sensitive to error propagation, using an online training procedure that also explores parser configurations resulting from non-optimal sequences of transitions.
result	6 This new parser outperforms greedy parsers trained using conventional oracles on a range of data sets, with an average improvement of over 1.2 LAS points and up to almost 3 LAS points on some data sets.

background	1 The field of privacy has seen rapid advances in recent years because of the increases in the ability to store data.
background	2 In particular, recent advances in the data mining field have lead to increased concerns about privacy.
background	3 While the topic of privacy has been traditionally studied in the context of cryptography and information-hiding, recent emphasis on data mining has lead to renewed interest in the field.
objective	4 In this chapter, we will introduce the topic of privacy-preserving data mining and provide an overview of the different topics covered in this book.

background	1 Social connectedness, i.e. the experience of belonging and relatedness between people, is a central concept in understanding and evaluating communication media, in particular awareness systems.
background	2 A generic measure based on this construct can support the design of such systems.
objective	3 The current paper describes the construction of two questionnaires for the measurement of this concept.
method	4 These questionnaires were subsequently applied in survey studies in order to establish the structure of the concept and to identify the items that are suited for the measurement of its dimensions.
method	5 One questionnaire was subjected to an initial validation.
result	6 We conclude with some preliminary suggestions regarding (design) approaches to foster social connectedness.

background	1 In this paper, we proposed a sentence encoding-based model for recognizing text entailment.
objective	2 In our approach, the encoding of sentence is a two-stage process.
method	3 Firstly, average pooling was used over word-level bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) to generate a firststage sentence representation.
method	4 Secondly, attention mechanism was employed to replace average pooling on the same sentence for better representations.
method	5 Instead of using target sentence to attend words in source sentence, we utilized the sentence’s first-stage representation to attend words appeared in itself, which is called ”Inner-Attention” in our paper .
result	6 Experiments conducted on Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus has proved the effectiveness of ”Inner-Attention” mechanism.
result	7 With less number of parameters, our model outperformed the existing best sentence encoding-based approach by a large margin.

background	1 Nowadays we are living an era which is marked by efforts for originality, innovation, collaboration, accumulation of experience and integration with and through many inventions such as computers, the internet, and technologies that have facilitated knowledge sharing and communication among people.
objective	2 This research seeks to extend the existing literature on KMS and knowledge sharing by proposing a conceptual framework, namely ECCCT (Evolution, Collaboration, Connection, Codification and Technical) that can be used to study how knowledge management systems (KMS) facilitate knowledge sharing to support decision making processes in multinational corporations (MNC).
method	3 In this research, 42 semi-structured interviews have been conducted with participants from 35 MNC in 11 countries.

background	1 In recent years, 3D point cloud has gained increasing attention as a new representation for objects.
background	2 However, the raw point cloud is often noisy and contains outliers.
method	3 Therefore, it is crucial to remove the noise and outliers from the point cloud while preserving the features, in particular, its fine details.
method	4 This paper makes an attempt to present a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art methods for filtering point cloud.
method	5 The existing methods are categorized into seven classes, which concentrate on their common and obvious traits.

background	1 Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook enable the creation of virtual customer environments (VCEs) where online communities of interest form around specific firms, brands, or products.
background	2 While these platforms can be used as another means to deliver familiar e-commerce applications, when firms fail to fully engage their customers, they also fail to fully exploit the capabilities of social media platforms.
result	3 To gain business value, organizations need to incorporate community building as part of the implementation of social media.

background	1 The Hick-Hyman Law and Fitts’ Law are two surviving human performance principles based on Shannon and Weaver’s (1949) Information Theory.
background	2 In the early 1980s, Card, Moran, and Newell (1983) presented the laws as design principles for developers to maximize usability in the design of human–computer interfaces.
background	3 A search of the current human–computer interaction (HCI) literature, however, will reveal that the Hick-Hyman Law failed to gain momentum in the field of HCI, whereas Fitts’ Law received, and continues to receive, substantial attention.
objective	4 This article begins with a discussion the common information theoretical concepts of the two laws, and then examines each law with respect to its origins, theoretical formulation, theoretical development, research, and applications and examines the possible contributing factors responsible for the failure of Hick-Hyman Law to gain momentum in the field.

background	1 Predicting the final state of a running process, the remaining time to completion or the next activity of a running process are important aspects of runtime process management.
background	2 Runtime management requires the ability to identify processes that are at risk of not meeting certain criteria in order to offer case managers decision information for timely intervention.
background	3 This in turn requires accurate prediction models for process outcomes and for the next process event, based on runtime information available at the prediction and decision point.
objective	4 In this paper, we describe an initial application of deep learning with recurrent neural networks to the problem of predicting the next process event.
method	5 This is both a novel method in process prediction, which has previously relied on explicit process models in the form of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or annotated transition systems, and also a novel application for deep learning methods.

background	1 Nowadays, the development of traditional business models become more and more mature that people use them to guide various kinds of E-business activities.
background	2 Internet of things(IoT), being an innovative revolution over the Internet, becomes a new platform for E-business.
background	3 However, old business models could hardly fit for the E-business on the IoT. In this article, we 1) propose an IoT E-business model, which is specially designed for the IoT E-business; 2) redesign many elements in traditional E-business models; 3) realize the transaction of smart property and paid data on the IoT with the help of P2P trade based on the Blockchain and smart contract.

background	1 Recently the cloud computing paradigm has been receiving significant excitement and attention in the media and blogosphere.
background	2 To some, cloud computing seems to be little more than a marketing umbrella, encompassing topics such as distributed computing, grid computing, utility computing, and softwareas-a-service, that have already received significant research focus and commercial implementation.
background	3 Nonetheless, there exist an increasing number of large companies that are offering cloud computing infrastructure products and services that do not entirely resemble the visions of these individual compo-

background	1 Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures.
background	2 The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices.
background	3 The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters.
background	4 These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams.
background	5 If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements.
background	6 Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years.
background	7 It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity.
objective	8 This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.

objective	2 This study aims to examine the influence of social media in the e-commerce context and to find how it impacts users' visit intention and purchase intention.
method	3 Through a questionnaire survey, we test and analyze the research model and its related hypotheses by making use of structural equation modeling.
result	4 The results indicate that social media interaction ties and social media commitment positively affect normative social influence and informational social influence.

result	6 In conclusion, we discuss the research findings and suggest some implications for researchers and practitioners.

background	1 Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) which utilizes single carrier modulation at the transmitter and frequency domain equalization at the receiver is a technique that has similar performance and essentially the same overall structure as those of an OFDMA system.
background	2 One prominent advantage over OFDMA is that the SC-FDMA signal has lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
background	3 SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA, especially in the uplink communications where lower PAPR greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of transmit power efficiency.
background	4 SC-FDMA is currently a working assumption for the uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE).
method	5 In this paper, we give an in-depth overview of SC-FDMA with focus on physical layer and resource management aspects.
result	6 We also show some research results on PAPR characteristics and channel-dependent resource scheduling of SC-FDMA.

background	1 Since the publication of the first papers on event-related brain potentials (ERP) and language in the 1980s, the field of electrophysiology of language has evolved a great deal.
background	2 This article is a brief overview of ERPs and languageprocessing research.
objective	3 It discusses how ERPs are derived, provides the pros and cons of using ERPs for language-processing research, and gives a summary of the major ERP components relevant to research on speech perception (mismatch negativity), word and sentence comprehension (N400, left anterior negativity, P600), and word production (lateralized readiness potential, N200).
objective	4 Additionally, it addresses current controversies concerning the interpretation of these components.
method	5 Applications of the ERP technique are illustrated with research on first and second language acquisition, bilingualism, and aphasia.

background	1 The core component of most modern trackers is a discriminative classifier, tasked with distinguishing between the target and the surrounding environment.
background	2 To cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches.
background	3 Such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies—any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same.
objective	4 Based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches.
method	5 By showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the discrete Fourier transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude.
method	6 Interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers.
method	7 For kernel regression, however, we derive a new kernelized correlation filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart.
method	8 Building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call dual correlation filter (DCF).
method	9 Both KCF and DCF outperform top-ranking trackers such as Struck or TLD on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (Algorithm 1).
method	10 To encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.

objective	1 This paper identifies 10 essential aspects, which, if not taken into account in an information security governance plan, will surely cause the plan to fail, or at least, cause serious flaws in the plan.

background	1 Deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation from RGB images require a huge amount of domain-specific labeled data for good in-the-wild performance.
background	2 However, obtaining annotated 3D pose data requires a complex motion capture setup which is generally limited to controlled settings.
method	3 We propose a semi-supervised learning method using a structure-aware loss function which is able to utilize abundant 2D data to learn 3D information.
method	4 Furthermore, we present a simple temporal network which uses additional context present in pose sequences to improve and temporally harmonize the pose estimates.
result	5 Our complete pipeline improves upon the state-of-the-art by 11.8%, and works at 30 FPS on a commodity graphics card.

background	1 Attention based neural network models have been successfully applied in answer selection, which is an important subtask of question answering (QA).
background	2 These models often represent a question by a single vector and find its corresponding matches by attending to candidate answers.
background	3 However, questions and answers might be related to each other in complicated ways which cannot be captured by single-vector representations.
objective	4 In this paper, we propose Multihop Attention Networks (MAN) which aim to uncover these complex relations for ranking question and answer pairs.
method	5 Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the question into a single vector, instead we use multiple vectors which focus on different parts of the question for its overall semantic representation and apply multiple steps of attention to learn representations for the candidate answers.
method	6 For each attention step, in addition to common attention mechanisms, we adopt sequential attention which utilizes context information for computing context-aware attention weights.
method	7 Via extensive experiments, we show that MAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark QA datasets.
result	8 Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of sequential attention over other attention mechanisms.

background	1 Group data sharing in cloud environments has become a hot topic in recent decades.
background	2 With the popularity of cloud computing, how to achieve secure and efficient data sharing in cloud environments is an urgent problem to be solved.
background	3 In addition, how to achieve both anonymity and traceability is also a challenge in the cloud for data sharing.
objective	4 This paper focuses on enabling data sharing and storage for the same group in the cloud with high security and efficiency in an anonymous manner.
method	5 By leveraging the key agreement and the group signature, a novel traceable group data sharing scheme is proposed to support anonymous multiple users in public clouds.
method	6 On the one hand, group members can communicate anonymously with respect to the group signature, and the real identities of members can be traced if necessary.
method	7 On the other hand, a common conference key is derived based on the key agreement to enable group members to share and store their data securely.
method	8 Note that a symmetric balanced incomplete block design is utilized for key generation, which substantially reduces the burden on members to derive a common conference key.
result	9 Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for group data sharing in cloud computing.

background	1 We consider supervised learning in the presence of very many irrelevant features, and study two different regularization methods for preventing overfitting.
background	2 Focusing on logistic regression, we show that using L1 regularization of the parameters, the sample complexity (i.e., the number of training examples required to learn "well,") grows only logarithmically in the number of irrelevant features.
method	3 This logarithmic rate matches the best known bounds for feature selection, and indicates that L1 regularized logistic regression can be effective even if there are exponentially many irrelevant features as there are training examples.
method	4 We also give a lower-bound showing that any rotationally invariant algorithm---including logistic regression with L2 regularization, SVMs, and neural networks trained by backpropagation---has a worst case sample complexity that grows at least linearly in the number of irrelevant features.

background	1 Clustering, in data mining, is useful to discover distribution patterns in the underlying data.
background	2 Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based (e.g., euclidean) similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the same partition are more similar than points in different partitions.
objective	3 In this paper, we study clustering algorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes.
method	4 We show that traditional clustering algorithms that use distances between points for clustering are not appropriate for boolean and categorical attributes.
method	5 Instead, we propose a novel concept of links to measure the similarity/proximity between a pair of data points.
method	6 We develop a robust hierarchical clustering algorithm ROCK that employs links and not distances when merging clusters.
method	7 Our methods naturally extend to non-metric similarity measures that are relevant in situations where a domain expert/similarity table is the only source of knowledge.
result	8 In addition to presenting detailed complexity results for ROCK, we also conduct an experimental study with real-life as well as synthetic data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques.
result	9 For data with categorical attributes, our findings indicate that ROCK not only generates better quality clusters than traditional algorithms, but it also exhibits good scalability properties.

background	1 Instant messaging (IM) has become one of the most popular forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and is especially prevalent on college campuses.
background	2 Previous research suggests that IM users often multitask while conversing online.
background	3 To date, no one has yet examined the cognitive effect of concurrent IM use.
background	4 Participants in the present study (N = 69) completed a reading comprehension task uninterrupted or while concurrently holding an IM conversation.
method	5 Participants who IMed while performing the reading task took significantly longer to complete the task, indicating that concurrent IM use negatively affects efficiency.
method	6 Concurrent IM use did not affect reading comprehension scores.
result	7 Additional analyses revealed that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their reading comprehension scores.
result	8 Finally, we found that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their self-reported GPA.
other	9 Implications and future directions are discussed.

objective	1 This paper presents the analogue of the time or frequency scaling theorem of continuous time/frequency Fourier Transform (FT) to the realm of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
method	2 The scaling property applies to scaling by integers which are relatively prime to the length of the DFT.
result	3 The time reversal property of DFT is identified as a special case of this theorem.

background	1 Waterfall development is still a widely used way of working in software development companies.
background	2 Many problems have been reported related to the model.
background	3 Commonly accepted problems are for example to cope with change and that defects all too often are detected too late in the software development process.
background	4 However, many of the problems mentioned in literature are based on beliefs and experiences, and not on empirical evidence.
method	5 To address this research gap, we compare the problems in literature with the results of a case study at Ericsson AB in Sweden, investigating issues in the waterfall model.
result	6 The case study aims at validating or contradicting the beliefs of what the problems are in waterfall development through empirical research.

background	1 The seemingly unshakeable accuracy of Moore's law - which states that the speed of computers; as measured by the number of transistors that can be placed on a single chip, will double every year or two - has been credited with being the engine of the electronics revolution, and is regarded as the premier example of a self-fulfilling prophecy and technological trajectory in both the academic and popular press.
background	2 Although many factors have kept Moore's law as an industry benchmark, it is the entry of foreign competition that seems to have played a critical role in maintaining the pace of Moore's law in the early VLSI transition.

objective	1 This paper measures flow in the context of gamification and investigates the psychometric properties of the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2).
result	2 We employ data gathered from users of an exercise gamification service (N = 200).
result	3 The results show that the original DFS-2 factorial structure does result in a similar model fit as the original work.
result	4 However, we also present a factorial respecification that satisfies more recent model fit thresholds.
result	5 Beyond validating the original DFS-2 instrument in the context of gamification, the psychometric analysis and the respecifications suggest that the components of flow divide into highly correlated conditions of flow (which were also found to be more salient in the context of gamification: autotelic experience, balance of skill and challenge, control, clear goals, and feedback) and into possible outcomes (merging action-awareness, concentration, loss of sense of time, and loss of selfconsciousness) from achieving flow.

background	1 Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector.
background	2 When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words.
background	3 Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words.
background	4 For example, “powerful,” “strong” and “Paris” are equally distant.
objective	5 In this paper, we proposeParagraph Vector , an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents.
method	6 Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document.
method	7 Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models.
result	8 Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations.
result	9 Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

objective	3 In this dynamic context, we have envisaged to study mobile communication diffusion in Germany and India, from a historical comparative perspective.
method	4 The basic standard for comparison has been Global Systems for Mobile Communications (GSM) and its data services, which was adopted by both economies.
method	5 Subsequently, critical success factors in each economy is drawn and compared with the other, to elicit future directions.

background	1 Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have the tendency to converge quickly into a single solution in the search space.
background	2 However, many complex search problems require the identification and maintenance of multiple solutions.
method	3 Niching methods are the extension of EAs to address this issue.
method	4 In our study, we propose an evolution strategy (ES) niching method, based on the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) mechanism.
method	5 We analyze our algorithm, introduce an experimental setup, and compare its performance with a previous ES niching method, known as the ES dynamic niching algorithm.
result	6 In our comparison we introduce for the first time a new analytical tool for niching analysis, and in particular the early niching formation process.
result	7 Based on successful data fit, we propose the well-known logistic model to describe our experimental results.

background	1 0: Typically, COTS undergo frequent upgrades.
background	2 1: Organizations while deploying these upgrades ensure the correctness of existing systems by carrying out exhaustive regression tests.
background	3 2: This process is typically costly and time-consuming.
background	4 3: An efficient approach to regression testing would be to execute a subset of the system test suite that provides sufficient confidence in the system behavior.
method	5 4: In that respect, we have developed a test framework that facilitates capturing and modeling of component interactions.
method	6 5: These interactions are analyzed to select a subset of test cases to be executed during regression testing.
result	7 6: The approach has been applied to a web-based system and the results obtained are quite promising.

method	1 In this study, modeling and simulation of a speed sensored field-oriented control (FOC) of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive is developed by using MATLAB Function blocks in MATLAB/Simulink.
method	2 This method allows easier algorithm and software development stages for experimental studies compared to the classical block diagram approach.
method	3 The superiority of the method over commonly used "Code Generation" tools is also emphasized.
result	4 First, a MATLAB/Simulink model of the FOC of PMSM drive is developed by using MATLAB programming in MATLAB Functions similar to C coding techniques.
result	5 The results of the simulation are presented.
result	6 Then, the MATLAB programming based codes developed in simulation are implemented in a TMS320F28335 floating-point MCU by using C programming language and the experimental results are obtained.
result	7 Finally, the results of the simulation and experiments are compared.

objective	1 0: This article deals with a ring–mesh network design problem arising from the deployment of an optical transport network.
objective	2 1: The problem seeks to partition the set of demand pairs to a number of rings and a mesh cluster, and to determine the location of the optical cross-connect system (OXC), while minimizing the total cost of optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs), OXCs, and fiber links.
method	3 2: We formulate this problem as a zero-one integer programming problem.
method	4 3: In strengthening the formulation, we develop some valid inequalities for the zero-one quadratic (knapsack) polytope and a columngeneration formulation that eliminates the symmetry of ring configurations.
method	5 4: Also, we prescribe an effective tabu search procedure for finding a goodquality feasible solution, which is also used as a starting column for the column generation procedure.
result	6 5: Computational results show that the proposed solution procedure provides tight lower and upper bounds within a reasonable time bound.

background	1 The video game software industry has a reputation for volatile, chaotic projects yet, in spite of dramatic growth in global revenues, surprisingly little academic work has examined these projects.
objective	2 This study reports a preliminary investigation into this under-researched area.
method	3 We interviewed eight video game producers from a range of companies, using a critical incident method to explore risk management practices and risk perceptions.
result	4 Our results revealed that in lieu of formal risk management practices, these managers relied on prototyping, pre-production decision points, and agile approaches to contain risk on their projects.
result	5 Among the risk factors mentioned, two are specific to the unique context of video game development.
result	6 The risk of failing to match the development strategy to the project was identified as a major cause of problems during the development process, and a new risk - the 'fun factor' - was a key element threatening the success of the final game release.

background	1 Phase noise is a topic of theoretical and practical interest in electronic circuits, as well as in other fields such as optics.
background	2 Although progress has been made in understanding the phenomenon, there still remain significant gaps, both in its fundamental theory and in numerical techniques for its characterisation.
objective	3 In this paper, we develop a solid foundation for phase noise that is valid for any oscillator, regardless of operating mechanism.
objective	4 We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random.
method	5 We obtain an exact, nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations.
method	6 This leads us to a precise characterisation of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing which we develop efficient numerical methods.
result	7 We demonstrate our techniques on practical electrical oscillators, and obtain good matches with measurements even at frequencies close to the carrier, where previous techniques break down.

background	1 The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm has attracted an ever increasing amount of interest among researches and practitioners in a wide variety of elds.
background	2 The SOM and a variant of it, the LVQ, have been analyzed extensively, a number of variants of them have been developed and, perhaps most notably, they have been applied extensively within elds ranging from engineering sciences to medicine, biology, and economics.
method	3 We have collected a comprehensive list of 3343 scienti c papers that use the algorithms, have bene ted from them, or contain analyses of them.
method	4 The list is intended to serve as a source for literature surveys.
result	5 We have provided both a thematic and a keyword index to help nding articles of interest.

background	1 Recently, there are many approaches proposed for mining roles using automated technologies.
background	2 However, it lacks a tool set that can be used to aid the application of role mining approaches and update role states.
method	3 In this demonstration, we introduce a tool set, RMiner, which is based on the core of WEKA, an open source data mining tool.
method	4 RMiner implements most of the classic and latest role mining algorithms and provides interactive tools for administrator to update role states.
result	5 The running examples of RMiner are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool set.

background	1 Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities.
background	2 Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms.
background	3 Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks.
objective	4 In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding.
method	5 Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space.
method	6 The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available.
result	7 We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.

objective	1 This paper systematically investigates the design of single transistor second-order active filters out-lining all possible architectures and possible impedance settings using an exhaustive MAPLE search code for all stable cases with the minimum number of passive elements (two resistors and two energy storage elements).
method	2 The search is performed on six general voltage-input voltage-output transfer functions, derived using a small-signal two-port network transistor model.
method	3 Selected LC and RC filter designs are verified experimentally.
result	4 The results presented here fill both a circuit-theoretic gap and an application-oriented gap related to single transistor filter design which, apart from a few examples in the literature, has not been rigorously addressed.

background	1 Many industrial applications with real-time demands are composed of mixed sets of tasks with a variety of requirements.
background	2 These can be in the form of standard timing constraints, such as period and deadline, or complex, e.g., to express application specific or non temporal constraints, reliability, performance, etc.
background	3 Arrival patterns determin e whether tasks will be treated as periodic, sporadic, or aperiodic.
background	4 As many algorithms focus on specific sets of task types and constraints only, system design has to focus on those supported by a particular algorithm, at the expense

background	1 Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC Challenge datasets, plateaued in the final years of the competition.
background	2 The best-performing methods were complex ensemble systems that typically combined multiple low-level image features with high-level context.
objective	3 In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 50 percent relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012-achieving a mAP of 62.4 percent.
method	4 Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly.
result	5 Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network.

background	1 Having developed multiobjective optimization algorithms using evolutionary optimization methods and demonstrated their niche on various practical problems involving mostly two and three objectives, there is now a growing need for developing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for handling many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problems.
objective	2 In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems.
method	3 Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points.
method	4 The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D).
method	5 While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.
result	6 This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.

background	1 The main contribution of this paper is an approach for introducing additional context into state-of-the-art general object detection.
method	2 To achieve this we first combine a state-ofthe-art classifier (Residual-101 [14]) with a fast detection framework (SSD [18]).
method	3 We then augment SSD+Residual101 with deconvolution layers to introduce additional largescale context in object detection and improve accuracy, especially for small objects, calling our resulting system DSSD for deconvolutional single shot detector.
background	4 While these two contributions are easily described at a high-level, a naive implementation does not succeed.
method	5 Instead we show that carefully adding additional stages of learned transformations, specifically a module for feed-forward connections in deconvolution and a new output module, enables this new approach and forms a potential way forward for further detection research.
result	6 Results are shown on both PASCAL VOC and COCO detection.
result	7 Our DSSD with 513 × 513 input achieves 81.5% mAP on VOC2007 test, 80.0% mAP on VOC2012 test, and 33.2% mAP on COCO, outperforming a state-of-the-art method R-FCN [3] on each dataset.

background	1 Many companies are deploying services, either for consumers or industry, which are largely based on machine-learning algorithms for sophisticated processing of large amounts of data.
background	2 The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive.
background	3 A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses.
background	4 However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on-chip storage of a multi-chip system.
background	5 This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost.
objective	6 In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines.
method	7 We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system.
method	8 We implement the node down to the place and route at 28nm, containing a combination of custom storage and computational units, with industry-grade interconnects.

background	1 Large-pose face alignment is a very challenging problem in computer vision, which is used as a prerequisite for many important vision tasks, e.g, face recognition and 3D face reconstruction.
background	2 Recently, there have been a few attempts to solve this problem, but still more research is needed to achieve highly accurate results.
method	3 In this paper, we propose a face alignment method for large-pose face images, by combining the powerful cascaded CNN regressor method and 3DMM.
method	4 We formulate the face alignment as a 3DMM fitting problem, where the camera projection matrix and 3D shape parameters are estimated by a cascade of CNN-based regressors.
method	5 The dense 3D shape allows us to design pose-invariant appearance features for effective CNN learning.
result	6 Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (AFLW and AFW), with comparison to the state of the art.

background	1 What will 5G be?
background	2 What it will not be is an incremental advance on 4G.
background	3 The previous four generations of cellular technology have each been a major paradigm shift that has broken backward compatibility.
background	4 Indeed, 5G will need to be a paradigm shift that includes very high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, extreme base station and device densities, and unprecedented numbers of antennas.
background	5 However, unlike the previous four generations, it will also be highly integrative: tying any new 5G air interface and spectrum together with LTE and WiFi to provide universal high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience.
background	6 To support this, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of flexibility and intelligence, spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and improved, and energy and cost efficiencies will become even more critical considerations.
method	7 This paper discusses all of these topics, identifying key challenges for future research and preliminary 5G standardization activities, while providing a comprehensive overview of the current literature, and in particular of the papers appearing in this special issue.

background	1 The success of deep learning has been a catalyst to solving increasingly complex machine-learning problems, which often involve multiple data modalities.
background	2 We review recent advances in deep multimodal learning and highlight the state-of the art, as well as gaps and challenges in this active research field.
objective	3 We first classify deep multimodal learning architectures and then discuss methods to fuse learned multimodal representations in deep-learning architectures.
method	4 We highlight two areas of research&#x02013;regularization strategies and methods that learn or optimize multimodal fusion structures&#x02013;as exciting areas for future work.

background	1 Engineers and researchers in the automobile industry have tried to design and build safer automobiles, but traffic accidents are unavoidable.
background	2 Patterns involved in dangerous crashes could be detected if we develop accurate prediction models capable of automatic classification of type of injury severity of various traffic accidents.
background	3 These behavioral and roadway accident patterns can be useful to develop traffic safety control policies.
background	4 We believe that to obtain the greatest possible accident reduction effects with limited budgetary resources, it is important that measures be based on scientific and objective surveys of the causes of accidents and severity of injuries.
method	5 This paper summarizes the performance of four machine learning paradigms applied to modeling the severity of injury that occurred during traffic accidents.
method	6 We considered neural networks trained using hybrid learning approaches, support vector machines, decision trees and a concurrent hybrid model involving decision trees and neural networks.
result	7 Experiment results reveal that among the machine learning paradigms considered the hybrid decision tree-neural network approach outperformed the individual approaches.

objective	1 This paper introduces GEOS, the first automated system to solve unaltered SAT geometry questions by combining text understanding and diagram interpretation.
objective	2 We model the problem of understanding geometry questions as submodular optimization, and identify a formal problem description likely to be compatible with both the question text and diagram.
method	3 GEOS then feeds the description to a geometric solver that attempts to determine the correct answer.
result	4 In our experiments, GEOS achieves a 49% score on official SAT questions, and a score of 61% on practice questions.1 Finally, we show that by integrating textual and visual information, GEOS boosts the accuracy of dependency and semantic parsing of the question text.

background	1 The Internet, World Wide Web, and related ICTs, have rapidly spread to a large number of countries and great variety of cultures.
background	2 Many of these technologies facilitate and mediate activities whose modes and means bind closely to culture.
background	3 Research has suggested that communication technologies can affect values and norms for behavior.
objective	4 Therefore, this research aims to explore and describe the impact of IT on culture, using Saudi Arabia as a context for our study.
objective	5 In particular, we are interested in answering the following question: How does IT impact culture?
method	6 We use phenomenological method, and provide an integration of a framework for IT-driven impact on culture.
result	7 The resulting framework can serve as a basis for further investigation to understand individuals’ culturally linked behavior to various IT in diverse contexts The ultimate goal is to lay a foundation for much needed research on the IT role in cultural change.

background	1 The role of frameworks in information systems has recently received a great deal of critical attention.
background	2 One prominent indictment, which has been directed at even commonly accepted frameworks, is that they lack empirical support, and in fact are not constructed in operational terminology.
method	3 This article reports the results of an experimental ab study using MBA students as subjects to investigate the tenets of the Gorry and Scott Morton framework (Gorry and Scott Morton, 1971).
result	4 While firm support is found for the assumption that the level of information attributes varies across system type in the direction postulated, there is evidence that the ability to differentiate the component attributes is affected by such factors as field dependency and mode of presentation.

background	1 With the transition of facial expression recognition (FER) from laboratory-controlled to challenging in-the-wild conditions and the recent success of deep learning techniques in various fields, deep neural networks have increasingly been leveraged to learn discriminative representations for automatic FER.
background	2 Recent deep FER systems generally focus on two important issues: overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data and expression-unrelated variations, such as illumination, head pose and identity bias.
objective	3 In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on deep FER, including datasets and algorithms that provide insights into these intrinsic problems.
method	4 First, we introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the literature and provide accepted data selection and evaluation principles for these datasets.
method	5 We then describe the standard pipeline of a deep FER system with the related background knowledge and suggestions of applicable implementations for each stage.
method	6 For the state of the art in deep FER, we review existing novel deep neural networks and related training strategies that are designed for FER based on both static images and dynamic image sequences, and discuss their advantages and limitations.
method	7 Competitive performances on widely used benchmarks are also summarized in this section.
method	8 We then extend our survey to additional related issues and application scenarios.
result	9 Finally, we review the remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in this field as well as future directions for the design of robust deep FER systems.

background	1 Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole.
background	2 The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising.
method	3 We propose a difference-in-differences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components.
method	4 Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates.
result	5 We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestimation of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000%.

background	1 In the course of the More Electric Aircraft program frequently active three-phase rectifiers in the power range of several kilowatts are required.
method	2 It is shown that the three-phase -switch rectifier (comprising three -connected bidirectional switches) is well suited for this application.
method	3 The system is analyzed using space vector calculus and a novel PWM current controller modulation concept is presented, where all three phases are controlled simultaneously; the analysis shows that the proposed concept yields optimal switching sequences.
method	4 Analytical relationships for calculating the power components average and rms current ratings are derived to facilitate the rectifier design.
method	5 A laboratory prototype with an output power of 5 kW is built and measurements taken from this prototype confirm the operation of the proposed current controller.
result	6 Finally, initial EMI-measurements of the system are also presented.

background	1 While significant attention has been recently focused on designing supervised deep semantic segmentation algorithms for vision tasks, there are many domains in which sufficient supervised pixel-level labels are difficult to obtain.
objective	2 In this paper, we revisit the problem of purely unsupervised image segmentation and propose a novel deep architecture for this problem.
method	3 We borrow recent ideas from supervised semantic segmentation methods, in particular by concatenating two fully convolutional networks together into an autoencoder—one for encoding and one for decoding.
method	4 The encoding layer produces a k-way pixelwise prediction, and both the reconstruction error of the autoencoder as well as the normalized cut produced by the encoder are jointly minimized during training.
result	5 When combined with suitable postprocessing involving conditional random field smoothing and hierarchical segmentation, our resulting algorithm achieves impressive results on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set, outperforming a number of competing methods.

background	1 Host-based security tools such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems are not adequately protected on today's computers.
background	2 Malware is often designed to immediately disable any security tools upon installation, rendering them useless.
objective	3 While current research has focused on moving these vulnerable security tools into an isolated virtual machine, this approach cripples security tools by preventing them from doing active monitoring.
method	4 This paper describes an architecture that takes a hybrid approach, giving security tools the ability to do active monitoring while still benefiting from the increased security of an isolated virtual machine.
method	5 We discuss the architecture and a prototype implementation that can process hooks from a virtual machine running Windows XP on Xen.
result	6 We conclude with a security analysis and show the performance of a single hook to be 28 musecs in the best case.

background	1 Recently, Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in deep learning have achieved significant results in the field of computer vision.
objective	2 To transform this performance toward the task of intrusion detection (ID) in cyber security, this paper models network traffic as time-series, particularly transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predefined time range with supervised learning methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), CNN, CNN-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) and CNN-gated recurrent unit (GRU), using millions of known good and bad network connections.
method	3 To measure the efficacy of these approaches we evaluate on the most important synthetic ID data set such as KDDCup 99.
method	4 To select the optimal network architecture, comprehensive analysis of various MLP, CNN, CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU with its topologies, network parameters and network structures is used.
method	5 The models in each experiment are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-05].
result	6 CNN and its variant architectures have significantly performed well in comparison to the classical machine learning classifiers.
result	7 This is mainly due to the reason that CNN have capability to extract high level feature representations that represents the abstract form of low level feature sets of network traffic connections.

background	1 The human forearm is composed of two long, thin bones called the radius and the ulna, and rotates using two axle joints.
objective	2 We aimed to develop a forearm based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body in order to bring out its benefits.
method	3 For this, we need to miniaturize the muscle modules.
method	4 To approach this task, we arranged two muscle motors inside one muscle module, and used the space effectively by utilizing common parts.
method	5 In addition, we enabled the muscle module to also be used as the bone structure.
method	6 Moreover, we used miniature motors and developed a way to dissipate the motor heat to the bone structure.
result	7 Through these approaches, we succeeded in developing a forearm with a radioulnar joint based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body, while keeping maintainability and reliability.

background	2 Most of the current systems use a centralized client-server model, in which the crawl is done by one or more tightly coupled machines, but the distribution of the crawling jobs and the collection of crawled results are managed in a centralized system using a centralized URL repository.
background	3 Centralized solutions are known to have problems like link congestion, being a single point of failure, and expensive administration.
background	4 It requires both horizontal and vertical scalability solutions to manage Network File Systems (NFS) and load balancing DNS and HTTP requests.
method	5 In this paper, we present an architecture of a completely distributed and decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) crawler called Apoidea, which is self-managing and uses geographical proximity of the web resources to the peers for a better and faster crawl.
method	6 We use Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based protocols to perform the critical URL-duplicate and content-duplicate tests.

background	1 Apache Cassandra is a leading distributed database of choice when it comes to big data management with zero downtime, linear scalability, and seamless multiple data center deployment.
background	2 With increasingly wider adoption of Cassandra for online transaction processing by hundreds of Web-scale companies, there is a growing need for a rigorous and practical data modeling approach that ensures sound and efficient schema design.
objective	3 This work i) proposes the first query-driven big data modeling methodology for Apache Cassandra, ii) defines important data modeling principles, mapping rules, and mapping patterns to guide logical data modeling, iii) presents visual diagrams for Cassandra logical and physical data models, and iv) demonstrates a data modeling tool that automates the entire data modeling process.

background	1 With the increasingly ubiquitous nature of Social networks and Cloud computing, users are starting to explore new ways to interact with, and exploit these developing paradigms.
background	2 Social networks are used to reflect real world relationships that allow users to share information and form connections between one another, essentially creating dynamic Virtual Organizations.
method	3 We propose leveraging the pre-established trust formed through friend relationships within a Social network to form a dynamic“Social Cloud”, enabling friends to share resources within the context of a Social network.
method	4 We believe that combining trust relationships with suitable incentive mechanisms (through financial payments or bartering) could provide much more sustainable resource sharing mechanisms.
result	5 This paper outlines our vision of, and experiences with, creating a Social Storage Cloud, looking specifically at possible market mechanisms that could be used to create a dynamic Cloud infrastructure in a Social network environment.

background	1 Data clustering is a frequently used technique in finance, computer science, and engineering.
background	2 In most of the applications, cluster sizes are either constrained to particular values or available as prior knowledge.
background	3 Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods cannot impose constrains on cluster sizes.
method	4 In this paper, we propose some vital modifications to the standard k-means algorithm such that it can incorporate size constraints for each cluster separately.
method	5 The modified k-means algorithm can be used to obtain clusters in preferred sizes.
method	6 A potential application would be obtaining clusters with equal cluster size.
method	7 Moreover, the modified algorithm makes use of prior knowledge of the given data set for selectively initializing the cluster centroids which helps escaping from local minima.
result	8 Simulation results on multidimensional data demonstrate that the k-means algorithm with the proposed modifications can fulfill cluster size constraints and lead to more accurate and robust results.

background	1 Recently, the Bitcoin-underlying blockchain technology gained prominence as a solution that offers the realization of distributed trust-free systems, where economic transactions are guaranteed by the underlying blockchain.
background	2 We are still at an early stage and thus require a deeper understanding of how the blockchain potentials can be realized, and what are the opportunities and challenges in so doing.
objective	3 Following a design science approach, we developed a proof of concept prototype that has the potential to replace a trust-based coffee shop payment solution that is based on an analogue, pre-paid punch card solution.
method	4 The demonstrator provides a starting point to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the blockchain technology when replacing a trust-based by a trust-free transaction system.
result	5 We conclude that the secure and trust-free blockchain-based transaction has the potential to change many existing trust-based transaction systems, but that scalability issues, costs, and volatility in the transaction currency are hindrances.

background	1 Little is known about the effects of successful psychotherapy on brain function in subjects with anxiety disorders.
objective	2 The present study aimed to identify changes in brain activation following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in subjects suffering from specific phobia.
method	3 Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation to spider videos was measured in 28 spider phobic and 14 healthy control subjects.
method	4 Phobics were randomly assigned to a therapy-group (TG) and a waiting-list control group (WG).
method	5 Both groups of phobics were scanned twice.
method	6 Between scanning sessions, CBT was given to the TG.
method	7 Before therapy, brain activation did not differ between both groups of phobics.
method	8 As compared to control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to spider vs. control videos in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
result	9 CBT strongly reduced phobic symptoms in the TG while the WG remained behaviorally unchanged.
result	10 In the second scanning session, a significant reduction of hyperactivity in the insula and ACC was found in the TG compared to the WG.

background	1 Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision.
background	2 Unfortunately, traditional image registration techniques tend to be costly.
method	3 We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration.
method	4 Our technique is faster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques.
method	5 Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing.
result	6 We show show our technique can be adapted for use in a stereo vision system.

background	1 Backpropagation and contrastive Hebbian learning are two methods of training networks with hidden neurons.
background	2 Backpropagation computes an error signal for the output neurons and spreads it over the hidden neurons.
background	3 Contrastive Hebbian learning involves clamping the output neurons at desired values and letting the effect spread through feedback connections over the entire network.
method	4 To investigate the relationship between these two forms of learning, we consider a special case in which they are identical: a multilayer perceptron with linear output units, to which weak feedback connections have been added.
result	5 In this case, the change in network state caused by clamping the output neurons turns out to be the same as the error signal spread by backpropagation, except for a scalar prefactor.
result	6 This suggests that the functionality of backpropagation can be realized alternatively by a Hebbian-type learning algorithm, which is suitable for implementation in biological networks.

background	1 Understanding gaming motivations is important given the growing trend of incorporating game-based mechanisms in non-gaming applications.

background	1 We present an end-to-end system for augmented and virtual reality telepresence, called Holoportation.
background	2 Our system demonstrates high-quality, real-time 3D reconstructions of an entire space, including people, furniture and objects, using a set of new depth cameras.
background	3 These 3D models can also be transmitted in real-time to remote users.
method	4 This allows users wearing virtual or augmented reality displays to see, hear and interact with remote participants in 3D, almost as if they were present in the same physical space.
method	5 From an audio-visual perspective, communicating and interacting with remote users edges closer to face-to-face communication.
result	6 This paper describes the Holoportation technical system in full, its key interactive capabilities, the application scenarios it enables, and an initial qualitative study of using this new communication medium.

background	1 This research demo describes the implementation of a mobile AR-supported educational course application, AR Circuit, which is designed to promote the effectiveness of remote collaborative learning for physics.
background	2 The application employs the TCP/IP protocol enabling multiplayer functionality in a mobile AR environment.
method	3 One phone acts as the server and the other acts as the client.
method	4 The server phone will capture the video frames, process the video frame, and send the current frame and the markers transformation matrices to the client phone.

background	1 Intrusion detection plays an important role in ensuring information security, and the key technology is to accurately identify various attacks in the network.
objective	2 In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS).
objective	3 Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model.
method	4 We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set.
result	5 The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification.
result	6 The RNN-IDS model improves the accuracy of the intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection.

background	1 In this letter, we develop a gaussian process model for clustering.
method	2 The variances of predictive values in gaussian processes learned from a training data are shown to comprise an estimate of the support of a probability density function.
method	3 The constructed variance function is then applied to construct a set of contours that enclose the data points, which correspond to cluster boundaries.
method	4 To perform clustering tasks of the data points, an associated dynamical system is built, and its topological invariant property is investigated.
result	5 The experimental results show that the proposed method works successfully for clustering problems with arbitrary shapes.

objective	3 In this review, energy storage from the gigawatt pumped hydro systems to the smallest watt-hour battery are discussed, and the future directions predicted.
objective	4 If renewable energy, or even lower cost energy, is to become prevalent energy storage is a critical component in reducing peak power demands and the intermittent nature of solar and wind power.
objective	5 An electric economy will demand more electrification of the transportation sector and it is likely that all vehicles sold by the end of this decade will have some level of hybridization.
objective	6 Energy storage capabilities in conjunction with the smart grid are expected to see a massive leap forward over the next 25 years.

background	1 Social media is becoming increasingly popular for news consumption due to its easy access, fast dissemination, and low cost.
background	2 However, social media also enables the wide propagation of “fake news”, i.e., news with intentionally false information.
background	3 Fake news on social media can have significant negative societal effects.
background	4 Identifying and mitigating fake news also presents unique challenges.
background	5 To tackle these challenges, many existing research efforts exploit various features of the data, including network features.
background	6 In essence, a news dissemination ecosystem involves three dimensions on social media, i.e., a content dimension, a social dimension, and a temporal dimension.
objective	7 In this chapter, we will review network properties for studying fake news, introduce popular network types and propose how these networks can be used to detect and mitigate fake news on social media.

objective	1 This paper presents a simple end-to-end model for speech recognition, combining a convolutional network based acoustic model and a graph decoding.
objective	2 It is trained to output letters, with transcribed speech, without the need for force alignment of phonemes.
method	3 We introduce an automatic segmentation criterion for training from sequence annotation without alignment that is on par with CTC [6] while being simpler.
result	4 We show competitive results in word error rate on the Librispeech corpus [18] with MFCC features, and promising results from raw waveform.

background	1 We propose a simple method for improving the security of hashed passwords: the maintenance of additional ``honeywords'' (false passwords) associated with each user's account.
background	2 An adversary who steals a file of hashed passwords and inverts the hash function cannot tell if he has found the password or a honeyword.
method	3 The attempted use of a honeyword for login sets off an alarm.
method	4 An auxiliary server (the ``honeychecker'') can distinguish the user password from honeywords for the login routine, and will set off an alarm if a honeyword is submitted.

background	1 Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been well-studied within diverse research areas and application domains.
objective	2 The aim of this survey is two-fold, firstly we present a structured and comprehensive overview of research methods in deep learning-based anomaly detection.
method	3 Furthermore, we review the adoption of these methods for anomaly across various application domains and assess their effectiveness.
method	4 We have grouped state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection research techniques into different categories based on the underlying assumptions and approach adopted.
method	5 Within each category, we outline the basic anomaly detection technique, along with its variants and present key assumptions, to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.
method	6 Besides, for each category, we also present the advantages and limitations and discuss the computational complexity of the techniques in real application domains.
result	7 Finally, we outline open issues in research and challenges faced while adopting deep anomaly detection techniques for real-world problems.

background	1 Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding.
background	2 Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design.
method	3 In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set.
method	4 On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.
method	5 Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.84, which is only 0.1 percent worse and 1.2x faster than the current state-of-the-art model.
method	6 On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines.
result	7 Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-ofthe-art.

background	1 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is an established method of measuring diagnostic performance in medical imaging studies.
background	2 Traditionally, artificial neural networks (ANN's) have been applied as a classifier to find one "best" detection rate.
background	3 Recently researchers have begun to report ROC curve results for ANN classifiers.
method	4 The current standard method of generating ROC curves for an ANN is to vary the output node threshold for classification.
method	5 Here, the authors propose a different technique for generating ROC curves for a two class ANN classifier.
result	6 They show that this new technique generates better ROC curves in the sense of having greater area under the ROC curve (AUC), and in the sense of being composed of a better distribution of operating points.

background	1 Tables are a common structuring element in many documents, s uch as PDF files.
objective	2 To reuse such tables, appropriate methods need to b e develop, which capture the structure and the content information.
method	3 We have d e loped several heuristics which together recognize and decompose tables i n PDF files and store the extracted data in a structured data format (XML) for easi er reuse.
method	4 Additionally, we implemented a prototype, which gives the user the ab ility of making adjustments on the extracted data.
result	5 Our work shows that purel y heuristic-based approaches can achieve good results, especially for lucid t ables.

background	1 The Playful Experiences (PLEX) framework is a categorization of playful experiences based on previous theoretical work on pleasurable experiences, game experiences, emotions, elements of play, and reasons why people play.
background	2 While the framework has been successfully employed in design-related activities, its potential as an evaluation tool has not yet been studied.
method	3 In this paper, we apply the PLEX framework in the evaluation of two game prototypes that explored novel physical interactions between mobile devices using Near-Field Communication, by means of three separate studies.
result	4 Our results suggest that the PLEX framework provides anchor points for evaluators to reflect during heuristic evaluations.
result	5 More broadly, the framework categories can be used as a checklist to assess different attributes of playfulness of a product or service.

objective	1 Feature selection aims to find the most important information from a given set of features.
objective	2 As this task can be seen as an optimization problem, the combinatorial growth of the possible solutions may be in-viable for a exhaustive search.
method	3 In this paper we propose a new nature-inspired feature selection technique based on the bats behaviour, which has never been applied to this context so far.
method	4 The wrapper approach combines the power of exploration of the bats together with the speed of the Optimum-Path Forest classifier to find the set of features that maximizes the accuracy in a validating set.
result	5 Experiments conducted in five public datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach can outperform some well-known swarm-based techniques.

background	1 Machine learning is a useful technology for decision support systems and assumes greater importance in research and practice.
background	2 Whilst much of the work focuses technical implementations and the adaption of machine learning algorithms to application domains, the factors of machine learning design affecting the usefulness of decision support are still understudied.
objective	3 To enhance the understanding of machine learning and its use in decision support systems, we report the results of our content analysis of design-oriented research published between 1994 and 2013 in major Information Systems outlets.
method	4 The findings suggest that the usefulness of machine learning for supporting decision-makers is dependent on the task, the phase of decision-making, and the applied technologies.
method	5 We also report about the advantages and limitations of prior research, the applied evaluation methods and implications for future decision support research.
result	6 Our findings suggest that future decision support research should shed more light on organizational and people-related evaluation criteria.

background	1 Money laundering has been affecting the global economy for many years.
background	2 Large sums of money are laundered every year, posing a threat to the global economy and its security.
background	3 Money laundering encompasses illegal activities that are used to make illegally acquired funds appear legal and legitimate.
objective	4 This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of machine learning algorithms and methods applied to detect suspicious transactions.
method	5 In particular, solutions of anti-money laundering typologies, link analysis, behavioural modelling, risk scoring, anomaly detection, and geographic capability have been identified and analysed.
method	6 Key steps of data preparation, data transformation, and data analytics techniques have been discussed; existing machine learning algorithms and methods described in the literature have been categorised, summarised, and compared.
result	7 Finally, what techniques were lacking or under-addressed in the existing research has been elaborated with the purpose of pinpointing future research directions.

background	1 Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Retrieval.
background	2 The results are not encouraging.
background	3 Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stemming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunking, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.)
method	4 only yield very small improvements or even a decrease in accuracy.
method	5 At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and storage cost dramatically.
method	6 This makes them hard to use on large collections.
result	7 We review NLP techniques and come to the conclusion that (a) NLP needs to be optimized for IR in order to be effective and (b) document retrieval is not an ideal application for NLP, at least given the current state-of-the-art in NLP.
result	8 Other IR-related tasks, e.g., question answering and information extraction, seem to be better suited.

background	1 Fog computing is a promising computing paradigm that extends cloud computing to the edge of networks.
background	2 Similar to cloud computing but with distinct characteristics, fog computing faces new security and privacy challenges besides those inherited from cloud computing.
result	3 In this paper, we have surveyed these challenges and corresponding solutions in a brief manner.

background	1 We present the MULTOVL application suite that detects and statistically analyses multiple overlaps of genomic regions in a fast and efficient manner.
background	2 The package supports the detection of multiple region intersections, unions and 'solitary' genomic regions.
background	3 The significance of actually observed overlaps is estimated by comparing them with empirical null distributions generated by random shuffling of the input regions.

background	1 Selecting views to materialize is one of the most important decisions in designing a data warehouse.
background	2 In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the issues in selecting views to materialize so as to achieve the best combination of good query performance and low view maintenance.
method	3 We first develop a heuristic algorithm which can provide a feasible solution based on individual optimal query plans.
method	4 We also map the materialized view design problem as O-l integer programming problem, whose solution can guarantee an optimal solution.

background	1 Graphical interface use involves schemata operations that range from transfer to induction.
background	2 The former apply existing knowledge, such as prior schemata, and are effortless, preconscious and intuitive.
objective	3 The latter, which consist in constructing new schemata, are resource-consuming and thus detrimental to intuitive use (IV).
method	4 A quantitative method is proposed to manipulate and screen schemata operations at the level of an interface's states and features.
method	5 Relevance for the design cycle of innovative interfaces is critically reviewed, and integration with existing intuitive-use design frameworks is proposed.
result	6 These considerations are built upon instructional design studies suggesting that assessment should precede and inform the application of design techniques geared toward IV.

background	1 Abstract— The new information technology is becoming an important factor in the future development of financial services industry, and especially banking industry.

background	4 Most of banks are using the Internet as a new distribution channel.
method	5 This paper presents a through survey of e-banking describing definition, barriers, benefits from the customers’, economy, and bank point of views, and main issues and challenges such as risk management and factors responsible for e-banking development.
result	6 Finally, conclusion and future perspective of e-banking development will be discussed.

background	1 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide a way to learn deep representations without extensively annotated training data.
background	2 They achieve this by deriving backpropagation signals through a competitive process involving a pair of networks.
background	3 The representations that can be learned by GANs may be used in a variety of applications, including image synthesis, semantic image editing, style transfer, image superresolution, and classification.
objective	4 The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of GANs for the signal processing community, drawing on familiar analogies and concepts where possible.
method	5 In addition to identifying different methods for training and constructing GANs, we also point to remaining challenges in their theory and application.

objective	1 This article presents an architecture vision to address the challenges placed on 5G mobile networks.
method	2 A two-layer architecture is proposed, consisting of a radio network and a network cloud, integrating various enablers such as small cells, massive MIMO, control/user plane split, NFV, and SDN.
method	3 Three main concepts are integrated: ultra-dense small cell deployments on licensed and unlicensed spectrum, under control/user plane split architecture, to address capacity and data rate challenges; NFV and SDN to provide flexible network deployment and operation; and intelligent use of network data to facilitate optimal use of network resources for QoE provisioning and planning.
result	4 An initial proof of concept evaluation is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposal.
result	5 Finally, other issues that must be addressed to realize a complete 5G architecture vision are discussed.

background	1 The world of science cannot be measured in terms of development and progress.
background	2 It shows how far human mind can work and think.
background	3 It has now reached to the technology known as “Blue eyes technology” that can sense and control human emotions and feelings through gadgets.
background	4 The eyes, fingers, speech are the elements which help to sense the emotion level of human body.
method	5 This paper implements a new technique known as Emotion Sensory World of Blue eyes technology which identifies human emotions (sad.happy.exclted or surprised) using image processing techniques by extracting eye portion from the captured image which is then compared with stored images of data base.
method	6 After identifying mood the songs will be played to make human emotion level normal.

background	1 Mobile business is a young promising industry created by the emergence of wireless data networks.
background	2 Similar to other emerging industries, it is characterized by a large number of uncertainties at different levels, in particular concerning technology, business strategy and consumer demand.
objective	3 This paper focuses on the strategic uncertainties, where a large number of actors are trying a number of strategic approaches to position themselves in the most favourable position in the value system.
method	4 This paper intends to apply a business model analysis methodology in order to better understand the strategic approaches of these actors.
method	5 We argue that successful business models are likely to be the ones that best address the economic peculiarities underlying this industry, like mobility, network effects and natural monopolies.

background	1 For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality).
background	2 To fulfil these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years.
background	3 While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalised; no synergies have been explored.
background	4 This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others.
objective	5 The main goal of this study is to holistically analyse the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration.
objective	6 In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.

background	1 In any competitive business, success is based on the ability to make an item more appealing to customers than the competition.
background	2 A number of questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness between two items?
background	3 Who are the main competitors of a given item?
background	4 What are the features of an item that most affect its competitiveness?
background	5 Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution.
method	6 In this paper, we present a formal definition of the competitiveness between two items, based on the market segments that they can both cover.
method	7 Our evaluation of competitiveness utilizes customer reviews, an abundant source of information that is available in a wide range of domains.
method	8 We present efficient methods for evaluating competitiveness in large review datasets and address the natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item.
result	9 Finally, we evaluate the quality of our results and the scalability of our approach using multiple datasets from different domains.

background	1 Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences.
background	2 For longer documents and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases.
method	3 We introduce a neural network model with a novel intraattention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL).
method	4 Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit “exposure bias” – they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training.
method	5 However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable.
result	6 We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets.
result	7 Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models.
result	8 Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.

background	1 In Singapore and Malaysia, people often speak a mixture of Mandarin and English within a single sentence.
background	2 We call such sentences intra-sentential code-switch sentences.
method	3 In this paper, we report on the development of a Mandarin-English codeswitching spontaneous speech corpus: SEAME.
method	4 The corpus is developed as part of a multilingual speech recognition project and will be used to examine how Mandarin-English codeswitch speech occurs in the spoken language in South-East Asia.
method	5 Additionally, it can provide insights into the development of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) for code-switching speech.
method	6 The corpus collected consists of intra-sentential code-switching utterances that are recorded under both interview and conversational settings.
method	7 This paper describes the corpus design and the analysis of collected corpus.

background	1 Knowledge Portals (KPs) are highly integrative Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) that promise to synthesize widely dispersed knowledge and to interconnect individuals in order to provide a ‘one-stop knowledge shop’.
background	2 Yet, KPs face major challenges in practice, as the intricacies of knowledge exchange are subject to varied individual and social factors.
background	3 At the same time, growing anecdotal evidence from case studies indicates KPs’ enormous potential.
objective	4 In this paper, we take some initial steps towards a theory for KPs that more distinctly conceptualizes KPs and emphasizes a KP’s role to unify networking and repository KMS features.
method	5 We describe three major challenges to successful KP deployment: (1) sufficient contribution, (2) favorable organizational culture, and (3) knowledge integration—and validate these as applicable to KPs through a review of 42 empirical papers.

background	1 The volume of convolutional neural network (CNN) models proposed for face recognition has been continuously growing larger to better fit the large amount of training data.
background	2 When training data are obtained from the Internet, the labels are likely to be ambiguous and inaccurate.
objective	3 This paper presents a Light CNN framework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with massive noisy labels.
method	4 First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation, called max-feature-map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN.
method	5 Different from maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an arbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive relationship.
method	6 MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also play the role of feature selection between two feature maps.
method	7 Second, three networks are carefully designed to obtain better performance, meanwhile, reducing the number of parameters and computational costs.
method	8 Finally, a semantic bootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more consistent with noisy labels.
result	9 Experimental results show that the proposed framework can utilize large-scale noisy data to learn a Light model that is efficient in computational costs and storage spaces.
result	10 The learned single network with a 256-D representation achieves state-of-the-art results on various face benchmarks without fine-tuning.

objective	1 In this brief, a systematic design procedure for a second-order all-digital phase-locked loop (PLL) is proposed.
method	2 The design procedure is based on the analogy between a type-II second-order analog PLL and an all-digital PLL.
result	3 The all-digital PLL design inherits the frequency response and stability characteristics of the analog prototype PLL

background	1 Machine learning techniques based on neural networks are achieving remarkable results in a wide variety of domains.
background	2 Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information.
background	3 The models should not expose private information in these datasets.
method	4 Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy.
result	5 Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.

background	1 Previous studies have presented conflicting claims regarding reasons that people become addicted to the Internet.
objective	2 In this study, we attempted to identify predictors of Internet addiction based on Sullivan's interpersonal theory and Internet addiction literature.
method	3 In our research model, it is hypothesized that good parent-child relationship positively correlates with good interpersonal relationships, which in turn are hypothesized to correlate with undesirable social anxiety.
method	4 In addition, both parent-child and interpersonal relationships are hypothesized to negatively correlate with Internet addiction, whereas the level of social anxiety is hypothesized to positively correlate with Internet addiction.
result	5 The results of this study confirm the research model hypotheses, indicating that the quality of parent-child relationship is indeed positively correlated to the quality of our participants' interpersonal relationships and that frustrating interpersonal relationships may raise the level of social anxiety.
result	6 In addition, interpersonal relationships, the parent-child relationship, and social anxiety all influence Internet addiction, as predicted by the model.
result	7 Finally, the more social anxiety and discontent with their peer interactions the participants experienced, the more addicted they were to the Internet.

background	1 For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle's position is a critical piece of information that enables advanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute safety-related, autonomous driving maneuvers.
background	2 This is because, without knowing the current location, it is very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future.
background	3 The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), an inertial measurement unit, and a digital map.
background	4 However, on urban driving environments, due to poor satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception, their longitudinal and lateral errors are too significant to be used to guide an autonomous system.
objective	5 To enhance the existing system's localization capability, this work presents an effort of developing a vision-based lateral localization algorithm.
method	6 The algorithm aims at reliably counting, with or without observations of lane-markings, the number road-lanes and identifying the index of the road-lane on the roadway that our vehicle happens to be driving on.
result	7 Testings the proposed algorithms against inter-city and inter-state highway videos showed promising results in terms of counting the number of road-lanes and the indices of the current road-lanes.

background	1 The core capabilities of an organization include critical skills of employees, management systems, and norms and values.
background	2 Core capabilities may be transferred fonnally and explicitly.
background	3 However, much knowledge, particularly knowledge with rich tacit dimensions, is transferred informally through processes of socialization and intemaiization.
objective	4 We focus on two transfer mechanisms—mentoring and storytelling—that can leverage the knowledge of an organization, particularly its tacit knowledge, to build core capabilities.
method	5 We draw on relevant research in leaming and cognitive psychology to clarify the conditions under which mentoring and storytelling can be most effective as carriers of knowledge.
method	6 Finally, we present recommendations for specific managerial practices that follow from our analysis.

background	1 There has been much interest in the Sharing Economy in recent years, accompanied with the hope that it will change and specifically make better use of existing resources.
background	2 It intuitively makes sense, from a sustainability point of view, that the sharing of resources is good.
background	3 It could even be said that the Sharing Economy ought to align well with Computing within Limits and its underlying premises.
method	4 In this paper however, we take a critical stance and will elaborate on the intersection between the Sharing Economy and Limits (including pinpointing potential conflicts) so as to identify and discuss a 'Limits-compliant Sharing Economy'.
method	5 We argue that even though there are limits to the Sharing Economy today, it still has potential benefits for a future of scarcity---but only if the practice of sharing is approached with a dual focus on sharing and on limits at the same time.
result	6 Finally we conclude that even though we have begun to explore the future of sharing, there is still a need to further develop ideas of how the underlying infrastructure for this movement will look.

background	1 There are many situations in which it is desirable to be able to distinguish spontaneous speech and speech which is non-spontaneous.
background	2 Examples of situations in which this problem may arise include forensic evidence situations, sorting voice-mail responses from voice-mail menus, and automatic segmentation of spontaneous responses from prepared questions.
background	3 The later situation can occur if it is desired to create a database of spontaneous data from data which consists of spontaneous discourse responding to prepared prompts.
method	4 This paper outlines and compares three methods for automatically classifying spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech and presents the cxperimcntal results comparing the performance of the methods.
method	5 All three methods are based on an analysis of the probability distributions of prosodic fcatures extracted from the speech signal.
method	6 The first method uses an expansion of the of the probability distribution in terms of the statistical moments.
method	7 The second method is an application of a modifed Hellinger’s method applied to histograms of signal amplitude and other speech features.
method	8 The third method is based on a measure of the nonGaussianity of the data.

result	8 We conclude the paper with discussion on future directions.

background	1 Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and finance, engineering, medicine and many other areas.
background	2 A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times (times-to-event).
background	3 Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the first hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a specific form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of first hitting times (the risk).
background	4 However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated.
objective	5 This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly.
method	6 DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time.
method	7 Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest.
result	8 Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.

result	3 We showed that combining GGA pseudo-potential with TB09 functionals would improve greatly the band gaps compared with the GGA calculations.

background	1 V-model and its variants have become the most common process models adopted in automotive industry guiding the development of systems on a variety of refinement levels.
background	2 Along with the exponentially growing complexity of modern vehicle systems, however, the late verification and validation in the conventional V-model expand in uncontrollable ways that result in higher cost of development and higher risk of failure than ever.
objective	3 This paper describes an inc-V development process for automotive industry that improves the conventional V-model and variants by introducing and institutionalizing early and continuous integrated verification enabled by simulation-based development.
method	4 We developed a continuous simulation model of the inc-V process, and the initial version is used to investigate the characteristics of the inc-V compared to V. The preliminary finding from the simulations of an example project is that the inc-V process is able to improve the traditional V process by saving effort, shortening duration, and increasing product quality.
result	5 The finding also show how the advance of development technology impacts the systems engineering processes.

background	1 Automated medical image analysis has a significant value in diagnosis and treatment of lesions.
background	2 Brain tumors segmentation has a special importance and difficulty due to the difference in appearances and shapes of the different tumor regions in magnetic resonance images.
background	3 Additionally the data sets are heterogeneous and usually limited in size in comparison with the computer vision problems.
background	4 The recently proposed adversarial training has shown promising results in generative image modeling.
objective	5 In this paper we propose a novel end-to-end trainable architecture for brain tumor semantic segmentation through conditional adversarial training.
method	6 We exploit conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and train a semantic segmentation Convolution Neural Network (CNN) along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming from the ground truth or from the segmentation network for BraTS 2017 segmentation task[15,4,2,3].
method	7 We also propose an end-to-end trainable CNN for survival day prediction based on deep learning techniques for BraTS 2017 prediction task [15,4,2,3].
result	8 The experimental results demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed approach for both tasks.
result	9 The proposed model achieves on validation data a DICE score, Sensitivity and Specificity respectively 0.68, 0.99 and 0.98 for the whole tumor, regarding online judgment system.

background	1 T paper shows that corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm value are positively related for firms with high customer awareness, as proxied by advertising expenditures.
background	2 For firms with low customer awareness, the relation is either negative or insignificant.
background	3 In addition, we find that the effect of awareness on the CSR–value relation is reversed for firms with a poor prior reputation as corporate citizens.
background	4 This evidence is consistent with the view that CSR activities can add value to the firm but only under certain conditions.

background	1 Monitoring the attentive and emotional status of the driver is critical for the safety and comfort of driving.
objective	2 In this work a real-time non-intrusive monitoring system is developed, which detects the emotional states of the driver by analyzing facial expressions.
method	3 The system considers two negative basic emotions, anger and disgust, as stress related emotions.
method	4 We detect an individual emotion in each video frame and the decision on the stress level is made on sequence level.
result	5 Experimental results show that the developed system operates very well on simulated data even with generic models.
result	6 An additional pose normalization step reduces the impact of pose mismatch due to camera setup and pose variation, and hence improves the detection accuracy further.

background	1 Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products).
objective	2 In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases).
method	3 There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN).
method	4 Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking.
objective	5 In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem.
method	6 We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt.
method	7 The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling.
method	8 We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN.
result	9 Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN.
result	10 The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.

background	1 5G wireless technology is paving the way to revolutionize future ubiquitous and pervasive networking, wireless applications, and user quality of experience.

background	1 Templates are an important asset for question answering over knowledge graphs, simplifying the semantic parsing of input utterances and generating structured queries for interpretable answers.
background	2 Stateof-the-art methods rely on hand-crafted templates with limited coverage.

method	4 Additionally, QUINT is able to harness language compositionality for answering complex questions without having any templates for the entire question.
result	5 Experiments with different benchmarks demonstrate the high quality of QUINT.

background	1 0: Traditional model of association rule mining is adapted to handle weighted association rule mining problems where each item is allowed to have a weight.
objective	2 1: The goal is to steer the mining focus to those significant relationships involving items with significant weights rather than being flooded in the combinatorial explosion of insignificant relationships.
method	3 2: We discuss the use of association rules mining algorithm to push information automatically, and proposed mixed weighted association rules mining algorithm that apply to information push.
method	4 3: We identify the related information set and the vertical weight through the analyzing of users’ behavior, and use the Google’s PageRank algorithm to define the horizontal weight of information.
result	5 4: At last, we evaluate our algorithm against the traditional Apriori algorithm in information push, thereby justifying empirically the strength of our approach.

background	1 Ancient Chinese architecture from the Song dynasty is a prominent example of the ancient oriental architectures.
background	2 The cai-fen system was a module system used for the carpentry of Song architectures, which was specified by the governmental manual, the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) compiled by Li
other	3 Jie [1103].
method	4 We present a rule-based approach for generation of ancient Chinese architectures from the Song dynasty.
method	5 Based on the special module system and the hierarchical topology of structural patterns in traditional Chinese architectures, the approach parameterizes the wooden elements of buildings and formalizes the construction rules for different architecture styles.
method	6 In the approach, XML-based description files are generated for displaying the construction process.
method	7 What the approach generates are standard architectures that strictly follow the ancient Chinese governmental manual.
method	8 To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, architectures in different styles have been generated based on their corresponding rules.
method	9 The fundamental difference between our approach and previous works is that we apply and implement the module system in digitalization of ancient Chinese architecture.

objective	1 This article presents an architecture vision to address the challenges placed on 5G mobile networks.
method	2 A two-layer architecture is proposed, consisting of a radio network and a network cloud, integrating various enablers such as small cells, massive MIMO, control/user plane split, NFV, and SDN.
method	3 Three main concepts are integrated: ultra-dense small cell deployments on licensed and unlicensed spectrum, under control/user plane split architecture, to address capacity and data rate challenges; NFV and SDN to provide flexible network deployment and operation; and intelligent use of network data to facilitate optimal use of network resources for QoE provisioning and planning.
result	4 An initial proof of concept evaluation is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposal.
result	5 Finally, other issues that must be addressed to realize a complete 5G architecture vision are discussed.

background	1 Traditional syntax models typically leverage part-of-speech (POS) information by constructing features from hand-tuned templates.
objective	2 We demonstrate that a better approach is to utilize POS tags as a regularizer of learned representations.
method	3 We propose a simple method for learning a stacked pipeline of models which we call “stack-propagation”.
method	4 We apply this to dependency parsing and tagging, where we use the hidden layer of the tagger network as a representation of the input tokens for the parser.
method	5 At test time, our parser does not require predicted POS tags.

background	1 Automatically generating a natural language description of an image has attracted interests recently both because of its importance in practical applications and because it connects two major artificial intelligence fields: computer vision and natural language processing.
background	2 Existing approaches are either top-down, which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words, or bottom-up, which come up with words describing various aspects of an image and then combine them.
objective	3 In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention.
method	4 Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks.
method	5 The selection and fusion form a feedback connecting the top-down and bottom-up computation.
result	6 We evaluate our algorithm on two public benchmarks: Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K.
result	7 Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches consistently across different evaluation metrics.

background	1 Wireless personal area network (WPAN) is small-ranged network centered at an individual for interconnecting personal devices.
background	2 For such a network, the bootstrapping mechanism with which the devices establish a secure group key is of critical importance.
background	3 Most existing bootstrapping mechanisms require out-of-band channels and involve human interactions for authentication.
objective	4 In this paper, we aim to develop a fully automated bootstrapping mechanism with only in-band channels with approvable security.
method	5 Toward this end, we designed an integrity-guaranteed message (IGM) structure, a self-authenticated key agreement protocol, and a prescheduling mechanism in allusion to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs.
method	6 The IGM structure guarantees that an adversary cannot modify the IGM message without being detected, thus protects the message integrity without the requirement of shared secrets between the sender and the receiver devices.
method	7 The proposed self-authenticated key agreement protocol utilizes the IGM's integrity guaranteed property, works together with the prescheduling mechanism to achieve message self-authentication, thus protecting the secure bootstrapping process from the node impersonation attack and the man-in-the-middle attack without leveraging any out-of-band channels.
result	8 We analyze the security performance of the proposed schemes, and show that they can be seamless interoperative with the existing IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

background	1 A recent study by Banerjee et al. (1998) proposed and tested an information technology (IT) ethics model.
background	2 They found that personal normative beliefs, organizational ethical climate, and organization-scenario were significant indicators of ethical behavioral intention.
background	3 Moreover, they found that factors affecting ethical intention are situational and depend upon the ethical dilemma.
background	4 Further research was suggested and recommended, among other things, replications with different samples.
objective	5 The present study furthers the development/validation of the IT ethical model by utilizing a large sample of students in the same organizational climate (a university).

background	1 Traditionally, the normalized cross correlation (NCC) based or shape based template matching methods are utilized in machine vision to locate an object for a robot pick and place or other automatic equipment.
background	2 For stability, well-designed LED lighting must be mounted to uniform and stabilize lighting condition.
background	3 Even so, these algorithms are not robust to detect the small, blurred, or large deformed target in industrial environment.
objective	4 In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based object localization method, called C-CNN: cascaded convolutional neural network, to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional methods.
method	5 Our C-CNN method first applies a shallow CNN densely scanning the whole image, most of the background regions are rejected by the network.
method	6 Then two CNNs are adopted to further evaluate the passed windows and the windows around.
method	7 A relatively deep model net-4 is applied to adjust the passed windows at last and the adjusted windows are regarded as final positions.
result	8 The experimental results show that our method can achieve real time detection at the rate of 14FPS and be robust with a small size of training data.
result	9 The detection accuracy is much higher than traditional methods and state-of-the-art methods.

objective	1 The purpose of this work is to present a study of the thermomechanical behavior of the automotive disc brake during the braking phase.
method	2 The first analysis is performed on the disc-pad model without the presence of thermal properties.
method	3 Structural performance of the disc-pad model such as deformation and Von-Mises stress is predicted.
method	4 The case of thermoelasticity on the same model with the inclusion of convection, adiabatic and heat flux elements were also studied.
result	5 The prediction results of temperature distribution, deformation, stress and contact pressure are presented.
result	6 Furthermore, the structural performances between the two analyses (mechanical and thermomechanical) were compared as well.
result	7 The results of this investigation may assist brake engineers to choose a suitable analysis in order to critically evaluate structural and contact behaviour of the disc brake assembly.

background	1 Retailers need to monitor products on store shelves in order to maintain adequate stocking and in many cases to comply with a placement arrangement defined by a planogram.
background	2 It is possible that such inspections be performed automatically or semi-automatically using computer vision techniques.
objective	3 Towards this goal, we propose an algorithm to detect shelves from images captured with a handheld digital camera.
method	4 First, we identify the vanishing point and the associated line segments corresponding to the shelves.
method	5 Second, we divide the image into equal-angle wedges centered at the vanishing point and project the associated line segments into the wedges.
method	6 Finally, we identify shelves by analyzing the projections.

background	1 Short text clustering has become an increasingly important task with the popularity of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook.
background	2 It is a challenging problem due to its sparse, high-dimensional, and large-volume characteristics.
objective	3 In this paper, we proposed a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model for short text clustering (abbr.
other	4 to GSDMM).
result	5 We found that GSDMM can infer the number of clusters automatically with a good balance between the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering results, and is fast to converge.
result	6 GSDMM can also cope with the sparse and high-dimensional problem of short texts, and can obtain the representative words of each cluster.
result	7 Our extensive experimental study shows that GSDMM can achieve significantly better performance than three other clustering models.

background	1 When networking researchers meet the task of doing simulations, there is always a need to evaluate the value of such models by measuring a set of well known network performance metrics.
background	2 However, simulators in general and NS-3 in particular, require significant programming effort from the researcher in order to collect those metrics.
objective	3 This paper reports a contribution for NS-3 consisting of a new flow monitoring module that makes it easier to collect and save to persistent storage a common set of network performance metrics.
method	4 The module automatically detects all flows passing through the network and stores in a file most of the metrics that a researcher might need to analyze about the flow, such as bitrates, duration, delays, packet sizes, and packet loss ratio.
method	5 The value of this module is demonstrated using an easy to follow example.
method	6 It is also validated by comparing the measurements of a simple scenario with the expected values.
result	7 Finally, the performance of flow monitoring is characterized and shown to introduce small overheads.

background	1 Trigger-Action platforms are web-based systems that enable users to create automation rules by stitching together online services representing digital and physical resources using OAuth tokens.
background	2 Unfortunately, these platforms introduce a longrange large-scale security risk: If they are compromised, an attacker can misuse the OAuth tokens belonging to a large number of users to arbitrarily manipulate their devices and data.
method	3 We introduce Decentralized Action Integrity, a security principle that prevents an untrusted trigger-action platform from misusing compromised OAuth tokens in ways that are inconsistent with any given user’s set of trigger-action rules.
method	4 We present the design and evaluation of Decentralized Trigger-Action Platform (DTAP), a trigger-action platform that implements this principle by overcoming practical challenges.
method	5 DTAP splits currently monolithic platform designs into an untrusted cloud service, and a set of user clients (each user only trusts their client).
method	6 Our design introduces the concept of Transfer Tokens (XTokens) to practically use finegrained rule-specific tokens without increasing the number of OAuth permission prompts compared to current platforms.
result	7 Our evaluation indicates that DTAP poses negligible overhead: it adds less than 15ms of latency to rule execution time, and reduces throughput by 2.5%.

background	1 Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as inter-region traffic, events, and weather.
objective	2 We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast the inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city.
method	3 We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data.
method	4 More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic.
method	5 For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic.
method	6 ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions.
method	7 The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region.
result	8 Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.

background	1 The field of object detection has seen dramatic performance improvements in the last few years.
background	2 Most of these gains are attributed to bottom-up, feedforward ConvNet frameworks.
background	3 However, in case of humans, top-down information, context and feedback play an important role in doing object detection.
objective	4 This paper investigates how we can incorporate top-down information and feedback in the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN framework.
method	5 Specifically, we propose to: (a) augment Faster RCNN with a semantic segmentation network; (b) use segmentation for top-down contextual priming; (c) use segmentation to provide top-down iterative feedback using two stage training.
result	6 Our results indicate that all three contributions improve the performance on object detection, semantic segmentation and region proposal generation.

method	5 Both a central site nonblocking protocol and a decentralized nonblocking protocol are presented.

background	1 Information systems development is a high-risk undertaking, and failures remain common despite advances in development tools and technologies.
background	2 In this paper, we argue that one reason for this is the collapse of organizational intelligence required to deal with the complexities of systems development.
background	3 Organizations fail to learn from their experience in systems development because of limits of organizational intelligence, disincentives for learning, organizational designs and educational barriers.
background	4 Not only have many organizations failed to learn, but they have also learned to fail.
background	5 Over time they accept and expect poor performance while creating organizational myths that perpetuate short-term optimization.
objective	6 This paper illustrates learning failure in systems development and recommends tactics for overcoming it.

background	1 Similarity is an important and widely used concept.
background	2 Previous definitions of similarity are tied to a particular application or a form of knowledge representation.
method	3 We present an informationtheoretic definition of similarity that is applicable as long as there is a probabilistic model.

background	1 Text in natural images is an important source of information, which can be utilized for many real-world applications.
objective	2 This work focuses on a new problem: distinguishing images that contain text from a large volume of natural images.
method	3 To address this problem, we propose a novel convolutional neural network variant, called Multi-scale Spatial Partition Network (MSP-Net).
method	4 The network classifies images that contain text or not, by predicting text existence in all image blocks, which are spatial partitions at multiple scales on an input image.
method	5 The whole image is classified as a text image (an image containing text) as long as one of the blocks is predicted to contain text.
method	6 The network classifies images very efficiently by predicting all blocks simultaneously in a single forward propagation.
result	7 Through experimental evaluations and comparisons on public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

background	1 The basis of applying deep learning to solve natural language processing tasks is to obtain high-quality distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, from large amounts of text data.
background	2 However, text itself usually contains incomplete and ambiguous information, which makes necessity to leverage extra knowledge to understand it.
background	3 Fortunately, text itself already contains welldefined morphological and syntactic knowledge; moreover, the large amount of texts on the Web enable the extraction of plenty of semantic knowledge.
background	4 Therefore, it makes sense to design novel deep learning algorithms and systems in order to leverage the above knowledge to compute more effective word embeddings.
objective	5 In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the capacity of leveraging morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge to achieve high-quality word embeddings.
method	6 Our study explores these types of knowledge to define new basis for word representation, provide additional input information, and serve as auxiliary supervision in deep learning, respectively.
result	7 Experiments on an analogical reasoning task, a word similarity task, and a word completion task have all demonstrated that knowledge-powered deep learning can enhance the effectiveness of word embedding.

background	1 Technological advances have made FPGAs an attractive platform for the acceleration of complex scientific applications.
background	2 These applications demand high performance and hi ghprecision floating point arithmetic.
objective	3 In this paper, we present a design for calculating the Lennard-Jones potential and for ce as is done in molecular dynamics simulations.

method	5 The design pres ented is a modular, very deeply pipelined architecture that exploits the fine-grained parallelism of the calculations.
method	6 With the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro as a target device, an implementation using two pipelines operating in parallel achieves 3.9 GFLOPS.

background	1 Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents.
background	2 ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research.
background	3 Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS "is a third way of doing science," in addition to traditional deductive and inductive reasoning (Axelrod 1997).
background	4 Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based models across a variety of application domains.
background	5 Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market, supply chains, and consumer markets, to predicting the spread of epidemics, the threat of bio-warfare, and the factors responsible for the fall of ancient civilizations.
objective	6 This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of ABMS, identifies toolkits and methods for developing agent models, and illustrates the development of a simple agent-based model.

background	1 The health and wellness sector is critical to human society and as such should be one of the first to receive the benefits of upcoming technologies like IoT. Some of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are connected to IoT networks to monitor the day-to-day activities of the patients.
background	2 Recently there has been attempts to design new medical devices which monitor the medications and help aged people for a better assisted living.
objective	3 In this paper, one such attempt is made to design a multipurpose portable intelligent device named MEDIBOX which helps the patients take their medications at the right time.
objective	4 This box is a proficient system which maintains the parameters like temperature and humidity in a controlled range recommended by the drug manufacturer and thus maintains the potency of the medicines even if the patient is travelling.
method	5 Related to this, we have developed a Host Management System (HMS) which is capable of cloud-based installation and monitoring that stores and controls the MEDIBOX functionality for further analysis and future modification in design aspects.

background	1 We describe ITS4, a tool for statically scanning security-critical C source code for vulnerabilities.
background	2 Compared to other approaches, our scanning technique stakes out a new middle ground between accuracy and eficiency.
method	3 This method is eficient enough to offer real-time feedback to developers during coding while producing few false negatives.
method	4 Unlike other techniques, our method is also simple enough to scan C + + code despite the complexities inherent in the language.
result	5 Using ITS4 we found new remotelyexploitable vulnerabilities in a widely distributed software package as well as in a major piece of e-commerce software.

background	1 Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner.
objective	2 In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network.
method	3 This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process.
result	4 We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.

background	1 Knowing individuals' relational orientation is imperative for effective offline, as well as online, interactions and collaborations.
background	2 We use attachment theory to examine the link between Facebook users' relational orientation (in terms of attachment styles: anxiety and avoidance) and their relational activities.
objective	3 Our research examines whether and how the two key relational processes identified in offline social relationships (self-expression and responsiveness) are manifested on online social networks and related to attachment styles.
method	4 We describe our dataset of 640 Facebook users, their attachment scale survey results, and their 525,334 posts.
method	5 We define four features that map onto relational activities on Facebook: status updates and status updates with emotional words (self-expression); comments and likes (responsiveness).
result	6 We find significant relationships between the users' attachment styles and their self-expression and responsiveness activities on Facebook.
result	7 A key takeaway of our research is that without relying on self-reported surveys, a computational analysis of a Facebook user's self-expressing and responding activities alone can reveal the user's underlying relational orientation (i.e., attachment style).

background	1 Snakes, or active contours, are used extensively in computer vision and image processing applications, particularly to locate object boundaries.
background	2 Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to concave boundaries, however, have limited their utility.
objective	3 This paper develops a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems.
method	4 This external force, which we call gradient vector flow (GVF), is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image.
result	5 The resultant field has a large capture range and forces active contours into concave regions.
result	6 Examples on simulated images and one real image are presented.

background	1 Sentiment analysis over Twitter offer organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics’ feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc.
background	2 A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classifiers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results.
objective	3 In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis.
method	4 For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. “Apple product”) as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment.
method	5 We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets.
result	6 Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively.
result	7 We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.

background	1 The trend toward physically dispersed work groups has necessitated a fresh inquiry into the role and nature of team leadership in virtual settings.
method	2 To accomplish this, we assembled thirteen culturally diverse global teams from locations in Europe, Mexico, and the United States, assigning each team a project leader and task to complete.
result	3 The findings suggest that effective team leaders demonstrate the capability to deal with paradox and contradiction by performing multiple leadership roles simultaneously (behavioral complexity).
result	4 Specifically, we discovered that highly effective virtual team leaders act in a mentoring role and exhibit a high degree of understanding (empathy) toward other team members.
result	5 At the same time, effective leaders are also able to assert their authority without being perceived as overbearing or inflexible.
result	6 Finally, effective leaders are found to be extremely effective at providing regular, detailed, and prompt communication with their peers and in articulating role relationships (responsibilities) among the virtual team members.
result	7 This study provides useful insights for managers interested in developing global virtual teams, as well as for academics interested in pursuing virtual team research.

objective	1 This chapter aims to provide an overview of the class of multi-criteria recommender systems.
method	2 First, it defines the recommendation problem as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and reviews MCDM methods and techniques that can support the implementation of multi-criteria recommenders.
method	3 Then, it focuses on the category of multi-criteria rating recommenders – techniques that provide recommendations by modelling a user’s utility for an item as a vector of ratings along several criteria.

result	5 Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion on open issues and future challenges for the class of multi-criteria rating recommenders.

background	1 Probabilistic forecasting, i.e. estimating the probability distribution of a time series’ future given its past, is a key enabler for optimizing business processes.
background	2 In retail businesses, for example, forecasting demand is crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time at the right place.
method	3 In this paper we propose DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto-regressive recurrent network model on a large number of related time series.
method	4 We demonstrate how by applying deep learning techniques to forecasting, one can overcome many of the challenges faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem.
result	5 We show through extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world forecasting data sets that our methodology produces more accurate forecasts than other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal manual work.

background	1 Unlike a univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree is not restricted to splits of the instance space that are orthogonal to the features' axes.
objective	2 This article addresses several issues for constructing multivariate decision trees: representing a multivariate test, including symbolic and numeric features, learning the coefficients of a multivariate test, selecting the features to include in a test, and pruning of multivariate decision trees.
method	3 We present several new methods for forming multivariate decision trees and compare them with several well-known methods.
method	4 We compare the different methods across a variety of learning tasks, in order to assess each method's ability to find concise, accurate decision trees.
result	5 The results demonstrate that some multivariate methods are in general more effective than others (in the context of our experimental assumptions).
result	6 In addition, the experiments confirm that allowing multivariate tests generally improves the accuracy of the resulting decision tree over a univariate tree.

background	1 A competitive implementation of customer relationship management (CRM) in retail banking requires business processes aligned to the value contribution.
objective	2 The objective of this paper is to derive a reference process on macro-level from industry best practice and validate its applicability in a survey.
method	3 Furthermore, we introduce a new method for evaluating existing business process implementations with respect to the business value, as measured by the value of the customer base as relevant overall key performance measure.
method	4 Comparing the individual company process and the reference process, in-house and external experts can evaluate the gaps by using the decision calculus method.
result	5 This allows a clear recommendation on the prioritization of potential process modifications and quantifies their effect in terms of business value.

background	1 The problem of concept learning, or forming a general description of a class of objects given a set of examples and non-examples, is viewed here as a search problem.
background	2 Existing programs that generalize from examples are characterized in terms of the classes of search strategies that they employ.
method	3 Several classes of search strategies are then analyzed and compared in terms of their relative capabilities and computational complexities.

background	1 We study the task of image inpainting, which is to fill in the missing region of an incomplete image with plausible contents.
objective	2 To this end, we propose a learning-based approach to generate visually coherent completion given a high-resolution image with missing components.
objective	3 In order to overcome the difficulty to directly learn the distribution of high-dimensional image data, we divide the task into initialization and texture-refinement as two separate steps and model each step with a deep neural network.
method	4 We also use simple heuristics to guide transferring of textures from boundary to the hole.
method	5 We show that, by using such techniques, inpainting reduces to the problem of learning two image-feature translation functions of much smaller dimensionality.
result	6 We evaluate our method on several public datasets and show that we not only generate results of comparable or better visual quality, but are orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

background	1 We consider the effect of imperfect separability in the received signals on the detection performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar with widely separated antennas.
background	2 The mutual orthogonality among the received signals is often assumed but cannot be achieved in practice for all Doppler and delay pairs.
method	3 We introduce a data model considering the correlation among the data from different transmitter-receiver pairs as unknown parameters.
method	4 Based on the expectation maximization algorithm, we propose a method to estimate the target, correlation, and noise parameters.
method	5 We then use the estimates of these parameters to develop a statistical decision test.
method	6 Employing the asymptotic statistical characteristics and the numerical performance of the test, we analyze the sensitivity of the MIMO radar with respect to changes in the cross-correlation levels of the measurements.
objective	7 We demonstrate the effect of the increase in the correlation among the received signals from different transmitters on the detection performance.

background	1 Plant diseases are important factors as they result in serious reduction in quality and quantity of agriculture products.
background	2 Therefore, early detection and diagnosis of these diseases are important.
method	3 To this end, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates the process of classifying banana leaves diseases.
method	4 In particular, we make use of the LeNet architecture as a convolutional neural network to classify image data sets.
result	5 The preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach even under challenging conditions such as illumination, complex background, different resolution, size, pose, and orientation of real scene images.

background	1 While favouring communications and easing information sharing, Social Network Sites are also used to launch harmful campaigns against specific groups and individuals.
background	2 Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives.
background	3 Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence.
objective	4 In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns.
objective	5 Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages.
method	6 We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate.
method	7 Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy.
method	8 Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
method	9 We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition.
result	10 The results show the effectiveness of the two classification approaches tested over the first manually annotated Italian Hate Speech Corpus of social media text.

background	1 We consider the problem of learning a sparse multi-task regression, where the structure in the outputs can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as outputs and internal nodes as clusters of the outputs at multiple granularity.
objective	2 Our goal is to recover the common set of relevant inputs for each output cluster.
background	3 Assuming that the tree structure is available as prior knowledge, we formulate this problem as a new multi-task regularized regression called tree-guided group lasso.
method	4 Our structured regularization is based on a grouplasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure.
method	5 We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap.
method	6 We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a largescale problem.
result	7 Using simulated and yeast datasets, we demonstrate that our method shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of true sparsity patterns compared to other methods for multi-task learning.

background	1 Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) like Defense of the Ancients and StarCraft II have attracted hundreds of millions of users who communicate, interact, and socialize with each other through gaming.
background	2 In MOGs, rich social relationships emerge and can be used to improve gaming services such as match recommendation and game population retention, which are important for the user experience and the commercial value of the companies who run these MOGs.
objective	3 In this work, we focus on understanding social relationships in MOGs.
method	4 We propose a graph model that is able to capture social relationships of a variety of types and strengths.
method	5 We apply our model to real-world data collected from three MOGs that contain in total over ten years of behavioral history for millions of players and matches.
method	6 We compare social relationships in MOGs across different game genres and with regular online social networks like Facebook.
method	7 Taking match recommendation as an example application of our model, we propose SAMRA, a Socially Aware Match Recommendation Algorithm that takes social relationships into account.
result	8 We show that our model not only improves the precision of traditional link prediction approaches, but also potentially helps players enjoy games to a higher extent.

objective	1 This paper presents a new method for detecting and recognizing text in complex images and video frames.
method	2 Text detection is performed in a two-step approach that combines the speed of a text localization step, enabling text size normalization, with the strength of a machine learning text veri3cation step applied on background independent features.
method	3 Text recognition, applied on the detected text lines, is addressed by a text segmentation step followed by an traditional OCR algorithm within a multi-hypotheses framework relying on multiple segments, language modeling and OCR statistics.
result	4 Experiments conducted on large databases of real broadcast documents demonstrate the validity of our approach.

background	1 Question Answering (QA) systems over Knowledge Graphs (KG) automatically answer natural language questions using facts contained in a knowledge graph.
background	2 Simple questions, which can be answered by the extraction of a single fact, constitute a large part of questions asked on the web but still pose challenges to QA systems, especially when asked against a large knowledge resource.
background	3 Existing QA systems usually rely on various components each specialised in solving different sub-tasks of the problem (such as segmentation, entity recognition, disambiguation, and relation classification etc.).
method	4 In this work, we follow a quite different approach: We train a neural network for answering simple questions in an end-to-end manner, leaving all decisions to the model.
method	5 It learns to rank subject-predicate pairs to enable the retrieval of relevant facts given a question.
method	6 The network contains a nested word/character-level question encoder which allows to handle out-of-vocabulary and rare word problems while still being able to exploit word-level semantics.
result	7 Our approach achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches that rely on an attention mechanism.

background	1 Intrusion detection based upon computational intelligence is currently attracting considerable interest from the research community.
background	2 Characteristics of computational intelligence (CI) systems, such as adaptation, fault tolerance, high computational speed and error resilience in the face of noisy information fit the requirements of building a good intrusion detection model.
objective	3 Here we want to provide an overview of the research progress in applying CI methods to the problem of intrusion detection.
method	4 The scope of this review will be on core methods of CI, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, artificial immune systems, swarm intelligence, and soft computing.
method	5 The research contributions in each field are systematically summarized and compared, allowing us to clearly define existing research challenges, and to highlight promising new research directions.
result	6 The findings of this review should provide useful insights into the current IDS literature and be a good source for anyone who is interested in the application of CI approaches to IDSs or related fields.

objective	1 We present a fast algorithm for computing approximate quantiles in high speed data streams with deterministic error bounds.
method	2 For data streams of size N where N is unknown in advance, our algorithm partitions the stream into sub-streams of exponentially increasing size as they arrive.
method	3 For each sub-stream which has a fixed size, we compute and maintain a multi-level summary structure using a novel algorithm.
method	4 In order to achieve high speed performance, the algorithm uses simple block-wise merge and sample operations.
result	5 Overall, our algorithms for fixed-size streams and arbitrary-size streams have a computational cost of O(N log(1/epsivlogepsivN)) and an average per-element update cost of O(log logN) if epsiv is fixed.

result	4 Since 2005, the performance of ALIZE has been demonstrated in series of Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SREs) conducted by NIST and has been used by many participants in the last NISTSRE 2012.
result	5 This paper presents the latest version of the corpus and performance on the NIST-SRE 2010 extended task.

background	1 The logistic regression model is used to predict a binary response variable in terms of a set of explicative ones.
background	2 The estimation of the model parameters is not too accurate and their interpretation in terms of odds ratios may be erroneous, when there is multicollinearity (high dependence) among the predictors.
background	3 Other important problem is the great number of explicative variables usually needed to explain the response.
objective	4 In order to improve the estimation of the logistic model parameters under multicollinearity and to reduce the dimension of the problem with continuous covariates, it is proposed to use as covariates of the logistic model a reduced set of optimum principal components of the original predictors.
method	5 Finally, the performance of the proposed principal component logistic regression model is analyzed by developing a simulation study where different methods for selecting the optimum principal components are compared.

background	1 Given a set of keywords, we find a maximum Web query (containing the most keywords possible) that respects user-defined bounds on the number of returned hits.
background	2 We assume a real-world setting where the user is not given direct access to a Web search engine's index, i.e., querying is possible only through an interface.
objective	3 The goal to be optimized is the overall number of submitted Web queries.
objective	4 One original contribution of our research is the formalization and theoretical foundation of the problem.
objective	5 But, in particular, we develop a co-occurrence probability informed search strategy for the problem.
result	6 The performance gain achieved with our approach is substantial: compared to the uninformed baseline (without co-occurrence information) the expected savings are up to 20% in the number of submitted queries and runtime.

background	1 Most current approaches for 3D object tracking rely on distinctive object appearances.
background	2 While several such trackers can be instantiated to track multiple objects independently, this not only neglects that objects should not occupy the same space in 3D, but also fails when objects have highly similar or identical appearances.
objective	3 In this paper we develop a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for similarity and proximity and leads to robust real-time tracking of multiple objects from RGB-D data, without recourse to bolton collision detection.

background	1 The volume of tissue activated (VTA) is a well-established approach to model the direct effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on neural tissue and previous studies have pointed to its potential clinical applications.
background	2 However, the elevated computational time required to estimate the VTA with standard techniques used in biological neural modeling limits its suitability for practical use.
objective	3 The goal of this project was to develop a novel methodology to reduce the computation time of VTA estimation.
objective	4 To that end, we built a Gaussian process emulator.
method	5 It combines a field of multi-compartment axon models coupled to the stimulating electric field with a Gaussian process classifier (GPC); following the premise that computing the VTA from a field of axons is in essence a binary classification problem.
result	6 We achieved a considerable reduction in the average time required to estimate the VTA, under both ideal isotropic and realistic anisotropic brain tissue conductive conditions, limiting the loss of accuracy and overcoming other drawbacks entailed by alternative methods.

background	1 125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner.
background	2 The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations.
background	3 The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving.
background	4 The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg).
background	5 The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

objective	1 We present here a new algorithm for segmentation of intensity images which is robust, rapid, and free of tuning parameters.
method	2 The method, however, requires the input of a number of seeds, either individual pixels or regions, which will control the formation of regions into which the image will be segmented.
method	3 In this correspondence, we present the algorithm, discuss briefly its properties, and suggest two ways in which it can be employed, namely, by using manual seed selection or by automated procedures.

background	1 One commonly used framework for developing and evaluating technology intensive information systems is CobiT. This framework was originally a benchmark of best control practices developed and maintained by the Information Technology Governance Institute, the umbrella organization to the Information Systems Audit and Control Association.
background	2 We empirically examine the conceptual model that underlies the CobiT internal control framework as it applies to an audit setting (including operational, compliance, and financial audit settings).
background	3 We find that superimposing CobiT's conceptual model onto audit relevant assessments made by a panel of highly experienced IT auditors confirms the internal consistency between the underlying constructs of CobiT. Furthermore, we find that CobiT's conceptual model predicts auditor behavior in the field related to their seeking help and giving help as evidenced by their postings to a general IT audit listserv.
result	4 Given the results of this study, we propose future research aimed at developing a general theory of internal control applicable to information technology based on CobiT. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

background	1 Automatic classification of fruits via computer vision is still a complicated task due to the various properties of numerous types of fruits.
objective	2 We propose a novel classification method based on a multi-class kernel support vector machine (kSVM) with the desirable goal of accurate and fast classification of fruits.
method	3 First, fruit images were acquired by a digital camera, and then the background of each image was removed by a split-and-merge algorithm; Second, the color histogram, texture and shape features of each fruit image were extracted to compose a feature space; Third, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of feature space; Finally, three kinds of multi-class SVMs were constructed, i.e., Winner-Takes-All SVM, Max-Wins-Voting SVM, and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM.
method	4 Meanwhile, three kinds of kernels were chosen, i.e., linear kernel, Homogeneous Polynomial kernel, and Gaussian Radial Basis kernel; finally, the SVMs were trained using 5-fold stratified cross validation with the reduced feature vectors as input.
result	5 The experimental results demonstrated that the Max-Wins-Voting SVM with Gaussian Radial Basis kernel achieves the best classification accuracy of 88.2%.
result	6 For computation time, the Directed Acyclic Graph SVMs performs swiftest.

background	1 As CMOS technologies have shrunk to tens of nanometers, aging problems have emerged as a major challenge.
background	2 There has been tremendous progress in developing new methods for modeling and diagnosing reliability at the level of individual transistors, but much less work on propagating these models to higher levels of abstraction to analyze and optimize the reliability of larger circuits.
result	3 This talk will provide an introduction to various circuit aging mechanisms and will then discuss research that develops computer-aided design techniques for estimating and enhancing the reliability of large digital circuits, examining solutions that could practically be applied to analyze or improve the lifetime of a design while maintaining consistency to accurate device-level models and the associated physics.

background	1 Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks.
background	2 Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices.
background	3 In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins.
background	4 Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home.
objective	5 In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier.
method	6 Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as “miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home.
method	7 The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications.
method	8 We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
result	9 Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.

background	1 Exaggeration of facial expressions is used in animation and robotics to intensify emotions.
background	2 However, modifying a human-like face can lead to an unsettling outcome.
background	3 This phenomenon is known as uncanny valley.
objective	4 The goal of this study was to identify the realism level and magnitude of facial expression that produce the maximum amount of emotional intensity and the minimum amount of perceived strangeness.
method	5 We studied the perceived intensity of emotion and perceived strangeness of faces with varying levels of realism (from schematic to photorealistic) and magnitude of facial expressions (from neutral to extremely exaggerated).
result	6 We found that less realistic faces required more exaggeration to reach the emotional intensity of a real human face.
result	7 While there is a range of emotional intensity that can be expressed by real human faces (from neutral to full intensity), we found that the same range of emotional intensity could be expressed by artificial faces when exaggeration was used.
result	8 However, attempts to express emotional intensities outside this range using exaggeration led to strange-looking faces at all levels of realism.

background	1 The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances.
background	2 The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications.
objective	3 We propose a new set of instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting.
method	4 We report results with state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.

background	1 Many modern robotics applications require robots to function autonomously in dynamic environments including other decision making agents, such as people or other robots.
background	2 This calls for fast and scalable interactive motion planning.
background	3 This requires models that take into consideration the other agent's intended actions in one's own planning.
method	4 We present a real-time motion planning framework that brings together a few key components including intention inference by reasoning counterfactually about potential motion of the other agents as they work towards different goals.
method	5 By using a light-weight motion model, we achieve efficient iterative planning for fluid motion when avoiding pedestrians, in parallel with goal inference for longer range movement prediction.
method	6 This inference framework is coupled with a novel distributed visual tracking method that provides reliable and robust models for the current belief-state of the monitored environment.
method	7 This combined approach represents a computationally efficient alternative to previously studied policy learning methods that often require significant offline training or calibration and do not yet scale to densely populated environments.
result	8 We validate this framework with experiments involving multi-robot and human-robot navigation.
result	9 We further validate the tracker component separately on much larger scale unconstrained pedestrian data sets.

background	1 Architectural views are at the foundation of software architecture and are used to describe the system from different perspectives.
background	2 However, some architectural concerns crosscut the decomposition of the architecture in views.
background	3 The drawbacks of crosscutting with respect to architectural views is similar to the drawbacks with respect to code, i.e. hampering reuse, maintenance and evolution of the architecture.
objective	4 This paper investigates the relations between architectural concerns, architectural drivers and views to identify why crosscutting manifests itself.
method	5 We propose to extend the architectural description with slices and composition mechanisms to prevent this crosscutting and perform an initial exploration of these concepts in an Online Auction system.
result	6 Within this limited setting the first results look promising to better separate concerns that otherwise would crosscut the views.

objective	1 This paper describes an algorithm to compute the envelope of a set of points in a plane, which generates convex or non-convex hulls that represent the area occupied by the given points.
method	2 The proposed algorithm is based on a k-nearest neighbours approach, where the value of k, the only algorithm parameter, is used to control the “smoothness” of the final solution.
result	3 The obtained results show that this algorithm is able to deal with arbitrary sets of points, and that the time to compute the polygons increases approximately linearly with the number of points.

background	1 Recurrent neural networks are powerful sequence learners.
background	2 They are able to incorporate context information in a flexible way, and are robust to localised distortions of the input data.
background	3 These properties make them well suited to sequence labelling, where input sequences are transcribed with streams of labels.
background	4 Long short-term memory is an especially promising recurrent architecture, able to bridge long time delays between relevant input and output events, and thereby access long range context.
objective	5 The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks in general, and long short-term memory in particular.
method	6 Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the alignment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of long short-term memory to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences.
result	7 Experimental results are presented on speech recognition, online and offline handwriting recognition, keyword spotting, image segmentation and image classification, demonstrating the advantages of advanced recurrent networks over other sequential algorithms, such as hidden Markov Models.

background	1 The purposes of this paper are to review the microinstruction sequencing capabilities of several microprogrammed computers; to determine whether these sequencing capabilities permit easy implementation of the control constructs of flowchartable program logic in modular microcode; and to present a set of microinstruction sequencing functions which will support "structured" microprogramming.
background	2 Several microprogrammable mini- and microcomputers which provide the user with the means for implementing special purpose instruction sets have been introduced relatively recently.
background	3 However, the experiments by Weber and Balzer which demonstrated the possibilities for increasing computation speeds, decreasing main memory space usage, and easing the task of applications programming by means of special purpose instruction sets implemented in microcode were performed some time ago.
