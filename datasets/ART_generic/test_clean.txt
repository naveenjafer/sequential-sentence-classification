Conclusion	This indicates that BRIa organization is more flexible than BRII on the cell surface..
Background	Removal of the serum, serum starvation, is used to isolate the effect of a specific growth factor on cell signaling, but can also affect the receptor concentration on the cell surface by up- or down-regulation at the gene expression level or through altered turn over through endocytosis.
Background	Specifically, serum starvation of A431 cells leads to the up-regulation of the BMP-type-II receptor within 72 h as seen by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and by immunofluorescence.42
Result	Thus, EGF stimulation leads to a redistribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform into regions enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform, since the CD of cavolon-1 α and the CD of caveolin-1 α and β are not significantly changed following EGF stimulation (p = 0.84).
Background	However, unless the caveolae are specific to particular receptor families, the high density of receptors in the domain could lead to interaction between different receptor systems and hence cross-talk between otherwise distinct signaling pathways.
Problem	Generally, we aim to understand whether stimulation of a cell with receptor specific ligands influences the receptor distribution or the caveolin composition within the caveolae.
Method	Labeled cells were visualized using a Biorad MRC 600 confocal microscope equipped with an Ar/Kr mixed gas laser and using the appropriate filter sets for dual fluorophore imaging.
Method	The resulting cross-correlation function is fit to a two-dimensional gaussian as above to give the amplitude of the cross correlation function, ggr(0,0).
Method	Once the g(0,0) value is known, an important parameter, called the cluster density (CD) can be calculated by eqn. (4).
Result	Figs. 1A and 2A show representative confocal images at high magnification (zoom 10 provides 15.5 μm × 15.5 μm images).
Method	A431 cells grown in 60 mm dishes were co-transfected with the plasmid containing a Smad Binding Element (pSBE), which is sensitive to the activation of the BMP signaling pathway, a Renilla luciferase reporter construct (which is used for normalization of the chemiluminescence response) and the caveolin-1 β construct using Fugene6 (Boehringer).
Problem	In this work, we investigate the association of caveolin-1 isoforms with the BMP receptors of type-II (BRII) and type-Ia (BRIa) and with the EGF receptor, ErbB1.
Result	In this work, we show that BMP and EGF receptors co-localize with these caveolin-1 isoforms in starved A431 cells to comparable extents.
Background	In the absence of the serum, cells divide less frequently, but grow well for up to one week.
Method	In this case, the two-dimensional cross-correlation function is obtained by first calculating the Fourier transform of each of the two images, then cross-multiplying the real part from the green image with the imaginary part from the red image (or the imaginary part from the green image with the real part from the red image, the result is the same) and finally calculating the reverse Fourier transform of the ‘mixed’ power spectrum.
Method	A431 cells were starved for 72 h and then stimulated (or not stimulated in control experiments) with the desired signaling protein.
Background	They are distributed slightly differently on the cell surface, and previous work suggests that there are caveolae composed only (or mainly) of the β isoform as well as caveolae with both isoforms present.9
Problem	In other words, the preformed complexes are inhibited by caveolin-1 β and the inhibition is released as a consequence of the redistribution of the caveolin-1 β in response to the BMP-2.
Method	The normalized, spatial cross-correlation function can be calculated as: ggr(ξ,η) = 〈δig(x,y)δir(x +ξ,y + η)〉
Background	It is, therefore, important to study protein–protein interactions within these domains and to determine whether these interactions can change.
Method	In practice, the two-dimensional autocorrelation function for the image is obtained by first calculating the Fourier transform of the image, then calculating the power spectrum (by multiplying the real and the imaginary components of the transform) and finally calculating the reverse Fourier transform.
Method	If the fluorescence intensity in a pixel, located at position (x,y) in the image, is i(x,y), then the corresponding normalized fluorescence intensity fluctuation, δi(x,y), is given by: The normalized spatial autocorrelation function, g(ξ,η), is then given by: g(ξ,η) = 〈δi(x,y)δi(x + ξ,y + η)〉where the angular brackets indicate the average over all spatial coordinates and ξ and η are position lag coordinates for the x and y axes in the image.
Background	The BMP and EGF receptors were labeled with donkey anti goat Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated secondary antibodies, whereas the caveolin-1 isoforms were labeled using goat anti mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies.
Result	In contrast, the co-localzation of caveolin-1 α and β, detected with clone 2297 and BRIa is not significantly affected BMP-2 stimulation remaining at about 26–27% (p = 0.95).
Result	Fig. 3B also shows that BMP-2 stimulation does not significantly change the fraction of co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with BRII, irrespective of which antibody is used to detect the caveolin-1 (clone 2297 or clone 2234) (p = 0.96 for clone 2234 and p = 0.98 for clone 2297).
Background	There is increasing evidence that domains on the cell surface exist to act as sites for protein–protein interactions leading to activation of specific signaling pathways.
Background	Image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS) is an extension of ICS.
Result	We are further able to show that the co-localization of BRIa with caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β isoform is decreased upon BMP-2 stimulation.
Method	Cells expressing the receptors were selected under mercury lamp illumination using a 60 × (1.4 numerical aperture) objective on an inverted Nikon microscope.
Background	Caveolin-1, 2 and 3 are key proteins, which are important for the formation of the invaginations on the cell surface.
Method	Normal A431 cells were grown on 22 mm coverslips.
Method	We apply image correlation spectroscopy techniques to determine quantitatively the density of the receptors and the caveolin-1 isotypes as well as the extent to which they co-localize.
Method	In ICCS, a cross-correlation function is also generated to measure the coincident fluorescence intensity fluctuations in images collected from two different chromophores attached to two different proteins or receptor types.
Background	They are thought to play a crucial role in cell signaling, endocytosis and intracellular cholesterol transport.
Method	Correspondingly, F(r/g) is the fraction of red labeled protein clusters containing green labeled proteins.
Method	Image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS) are two techniques that can be used to study the distribution and localization of receptors.33–38
Result	Fig. 3B shows that prior to stimulation with BMP-2 the fraction of co-localization of caveolin-1 α, as detected with clone 2234, and BRIa is about 20% (one fifth of the caveolae contain the receptor) and that after stimulation, the fraction of co-localization is about 34% (one third of the caveolae contain the receptor).
Problem	Since EGF and BMP mediate their signal through receptors that act respectively as serine threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases, it is likely that the influence on the caveolae compositions are caused by direct interactions with the caveolins, rather than through their respective signaling events.
Problem	Since BRII is a constitutively active kinase there must be a mechanism whereby the transphosphorylation of BRIa by BRII is silenced in the absence of BMP stimulation.
Method	The cells were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min and afterwards, they were incubated with the corresponding fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies at a concentration of 20 μg mL−1.
Conclusion	As described above, stimulation of A431 cells with BMP or EGF influences the aggregation of caveolin-1 β and appears to lead to changes in the composition of the caveolae.
Background	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subfamily of the TGF beta superfamily and their response is mediated by serine/threonine kinase receptors.
Method	Accordingly, we transfected the A431 cells with the caveolin-1 β isoform causing an overexpression.
Conclusion	This demonstrates that caveolae are dynamic structures on the cell surface whose composition may change to influence the signaling activity.
Problem	An analogous inhibitory effect may be exerted on the ErbB1 receptor.
Result	This suggests that the presence of excess caveolin-1 β isoform inhibits the BMP-2 signaling pathway.
Background	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play crucial roles during embryonic development in chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, neurogenesis and hematopoiesis.10–17
Method	These are calculated from the individual images as indicated above.
Result	We further show that about 20–30% of the caveolin-1 present at the surface of the cells co-localize with the EGF and BMP receptors.
Conclusion	BMP as well as EGF stimulation leads to a rearrangement of the caveolin-1 β isoform into domains enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform.
Method	Following 72 h of serum-starvation, the A431 cells were stimulated, or not stimulated, with 20 nM BMP-2 for 2.5 h or 100 ng mL−1 EGF for 30 min and fixed using acetone/methanol fixation.32
Method	In order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the population properties (cluster density, fraction of co-localization) the data are pooled and averaged when more than one experiment is conducted.
Method	In all cases, the cluster density data are represented relative to the value for one, selected control experiment.
Method	The average cluster density was calculated for this large number of images in order to obtain good population statistics.
Method	The percent of caveolin-1 co-localizing with the BMP or EGF receptors was estimated using eqn. (8).
Method	ICS involves autocorrelation analysis of the intensity fluctuations within confocal images collected, in this case, from cells that contain immunofluorescently labeled proteins.
Background	Still, the two caveolin-1 isoforms have a common hydrophobic stretch of amino acids, a scaffolding domain and an acetylated C-terminus.7,8
Method	The experiments are designed to collect a large number of images, typically forty, each from a different cell in the sample.
Result	However, BMP-2 stimulation does not significantly change the cluster density of caveolin-1 α when detected alone by clone 2234 (p = 0.97).
Conclusion	Evidently, EGF and BMP-2 cause comparable changes in the caveolin isoform redistribution: in both cases the caveolin-1 β isoform is reorganized into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α following exposure to the signaling protein.
Conclusion	Our data suggest that the two isoforms of caveolin-1 play different roles on the cell surface and that caveolae are dynamic structures.
Method	Normally cells are grown in a culture medium to which 10% fetal bovine serum is added.
Method	Cells were washed again three times for 5 min with PBS and the coverslips were mounted on airvol and dried overnight.
Conclusion	Stimulation of these starved A431 cells with either BMP-2 or EGF leads to comparable redistributions of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β isoform into caveolae containing both caveolin-1 α and β isoforms.
Result	Fig. 1B indicates that BMP-2 stimulation of starved A431 cells leads to a 39% decrease in the cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β as detected by labeling with the caveolin-1 antibody clone 2297 (p = 8.75 × 10−5).
Result	However, the co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with ErbB1 is not changed significantly following EGF stimulation (p = 0.62).
Result	Using a reporter gene assay sensitive to the activation of the BMP pathway, we show that overexpression of caveolin-1 β inhibits signaling.
Method	Specifically: Here, N̄g, N̄r and N̄gr are the average number of clusters which are made up of only green labeled proteins, only red labeled proteins, and both green and red labeled proteins, respectively.
Background	It is known that BMP receptors can form preformed complexes between BRIa and BRII prior to BMP-2 binding, but these preformed complexes do not signal in the absence of BMP-2.
Method	The secondary antibodies, donkey anti-goat RRX and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA).
Background	The serum provides some nutrients, but most importantly, a series of growth factors that stimulate cell proliferation.
Background	They exert their function by signaling through serine threonine kinase receptors.
Result	This suggests that the change in cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β arises from changes in the distribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform.
Method	Serum starved A431 cells, stimulated or not stimulated with BMP-2 or EGF, were fixed and the BMP receptors, EGF receptors and caveolin-1 isoforms were labeled using the specific antibodies against the proteins of interest and appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies.
Result	We demonstrate that overexpression of the caveolin β isoform in starved A431 cells leads to an inhibition of BMP-2 induced signaling.
Background	Caveolin-1 is expressed in two isoforms, caveolin-1 α and caveolin-1 β, that differ in their coding.
Background	Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations of the cell membrane, which are thought to play a crucial role in endocytosis, signaling and intracellular cholesterol transport.1–3
Method	The significance of changes relative to the control was assessed by paired, two-tailed t-tests.
Problem	Here we report on the aggregation and association of caveolin-1 isoforms with these receptors and the effect of BMP and EGF activation on caveolin-1 distribution in A431 cells.
Method	The cells were then fixed and labeled for the caveolin-1 isoforms using a monoclonal antibody against caveolin-1 α or a monoclonal antibody recognizing both α and β isoforms followed by a secondary fluorescent antibody.
Method	After transfection, the cells were stimulated, or not stimulated, for 12 h with 20 nM BMP-2, lysed and the luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Background	Caveolin-1 can exist as two isoforms differing in their N-terminus.
Background	Previous studies have shown that the interaction between the EGF receptor (ErbB1) and caveolin leads to inhibition of the kinase activity of the receptor.
Result	As Fig. 5 shows, BMP-2 stimulation leads to a four-fold increase in luciferase activity in these starved cells.
Method	It can be seen that ICCS provides quantitative information about the extent of co-localization of two different receptors, or in the current work, a receptor and a binding protein.
Conclusion	This provided new evidence for the existence of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform only.
Problem	Since EGF stimulation causes a redistribution of caveolin-1 β it is possible that it is this isoform that specifically causes the inhibition and that the redistribution is intended to remove the inhibitory effect to allow signaling to take place.
Background	It has been shown for individual molecules that the zero-lag amplitude of the cross-correlation function reflects the extent of co-localization of the two chromophores on the cell surface.35,36
Result	The combination of these observations, increase in co-localization with caveolin-1 α and no change with both, indicates that less caveolin-1 β co-localizes with BRIa following stimulation with BMP-2.
Method	Recombinant BMP-2 was obtained from Wyeth (Boston, NY, USA) and human recombinant EGF was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Background	Past work indicates that the largest source of uncertainty in the ICS and ICCS measurements arises from variations between cells in a population.
Conclusion	Most likely, BMP-2 stimulation leads to a redistribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform into regions enriched in the α isoform, since the CD of caveolin-1 α and the CD of caveolin-1 α and β are not significantly different following the BMP-2 stimulation (p = 0.14).
Result	Upon stimulation, the receptors are released from the caveolin-1 β inhibitory effect as the caveolin-1 β redistributes.
Background	Caveolin-1, 2 and 3 are the key proteins involved in the formation of the invaginations.4–6
Result	Fig. 4B shows that EGF stimulation increases the co-localization of caveolin-1 α with ErbB1 by about 50% (p = 2.93 × 10−5).
Conclusion	This provides evidence that the caveolin-1 β isoform may inhibit signaling in caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β, suggesting that these caveolae may function to sequester the receptors in non-functional domains until they are needed, that is, they may act as storage units for the receptors.
Method	The antibodies recognizing only caveolin-1 α (clone 2234) or both of the caveolin-1 α and β isoforms (clone 2297) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (New York, NY, USA).
Method	Also, gg(0,0) and gr(0,0) are the autocorrelation functions corresponding to the individual green and red images.
Result	It is evident that the extent of co-localization is less than 100% and therefore some of the receptors are outside the caveolae and some of the caveolae contain no receptors.
Method	The polyclonal antisera against the BMP receptors, BRIa and BRII, and the polyclonal antibody against the EGF receptor were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Method	It is known that the limit of the autocorrelation function as ξ and η approach zero, g(0,0), is equal to the variance of the normalized intensity fluctuations.40
Result	The cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β is decreased upon stimulation with BMP-2 or EGF, showing a redistribution of caveolin-1 β into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α.
Method	We then used a reporter gene assay to examine the influence of this overexpression on the activation of the Smad signaling pathway.
Background	Little is known about the difference between these two isoforms, and less in known about their role in cell signaling.
Method	Fifteen scans were accumulated on photomultiplier tube 2 (PMT2) in the photon counting mode (to ensure linear scaling of the intensity).
Background	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to signal through tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family.
Background	Caveolae are small, flask shaped invaginations in the cell membrane.
Problem	The implication is that BMP-2 stimulation may form caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform and BRIa.
Problem	Caveolin-1 isoform reorganization studied by image correlation spectroscopy
Method	The resulting two-dimensional autocorrelation function is then fit to a two-dimensional gaussian function of known width (corresponding to the width of the laser beam at the focal point of confocal microscope).
Method	The filter wheel was then shifted to allow excitation with the 568 nm laser line for Alexa Fluor 568 fluorescence, and 20 scans were accumulated on PMT1 for BMP receptors, whereas 9 scans were accumulated on PMT1 for the EGF receptor (EFGR).
Method	The technique and selected applications have been presented previously at Faraday Discussion .11139
Method	The values of the standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated from the raw data at the 95% confidence level.
Method	We, therefore, examined the extent of co-localization of the receptors with each of the caveolin-1 isoforms using image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS).
Method	After collection of each set of images was finished, additional images were collected using identical settings but with the shutter to the sample closed to obtain a measure of the dark current for each PMT.
Method	One receptor type is labeled with a green probe and is imaged to give the intensity map, ig(x,y), while the second receptor type is labeled with a red probe and imaged to give the intensity map, ir(x,y).
Method	To measure the distribution of the caveolin-1 on the cell surface, we employed ICS and ICCS measurements, which require acquisition of high quality fluorescence images with a laser scanning confocal microscope.
Background	In the case of the BMP receptors, their organization in caveolae may facilitate creation of preformed complexes of type-I and type II receptors.
Problem	Since the BMP-2 and EGF stimulation cause the same effect, the first step is to determine whether there is inhibition of the BMP signaling when the interaction with the caveolin-1 β isoform is enhanced.
Conclusion	It is evident that the interaction of the receptors (BRIa and ErbB1) with the caveolin-1 isoforms is sensitive to the state of activation.
Result	This observation is the same as that observed following BMP-2 stimulation.
Method	Forty high magnification images of flat regions of the cell surface were collected from forty separate cells and subjected to ICS analysis to provide a cluster density for each image (eqn. (4)).
Result	However, co-expression of caveolin-1 β with the pSBE in A431 cells leads to a decrease in luciferase activity back to the level of unstimulated A431 cells even when they are stimulated with BMP-2.
Conclusion	The fact that both BMP-2 and EGF induce the same redistribution of caveolin-1 suggests that the phenomenon may be general and that the redistribution is functionally important in the signaling process.
Result	This is consistent with the previous studies on the ErbB1 that show that interaction of caveolin-1 with the EGF receptor inhibits receptor kinase activity, although in that work it was not attributed specifically to the caveolin-1 β isoform44.
Problem	It is possible that the caveolin-1 β enriched domains serve this function.
Method	The CD value is an estimate of the average number of receptor clusters per unit area i.e.,
Method	The only caveat is that the interpretation of eqn. (6) is strictly only valid for individual chromophores.
Result	This observation is parallel to that observed for BRIa in Fig. 3B and the conclusion is equivalent: Stimulation of A431 cells by EGF causes the redistribution of caveolin-1 β into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α and the increase in caveolin-1 α co-localization with ErbB1 provides evidence for the existence of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform and ErbB1.
Method	The plasmid encoding GFP-tagged caveolin-1 β was provided by Dr H. Kogo (Department of Anatomy, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.)
Background	By serving as regions of the cell surface that can be enriched in receptors to signaling proteins, the probability of interaction among the receptors increases significantly allowing for more rapid responses.
Method	Specifically, we co-transfected pSBE (with a Renilla luciferase construct) into A431 cells since the pSBE is known to be responsive to the activation of BMP signaling.43
Background	There is evidence that these isoforms play different roles in caveolae formation.9
Method	We interpret the amplitude to reflect the average number of clusters with both chromophores present.
Method	An area on the cell, removed from the nucleus, was enlarged and recorded at the zoom 10 setting.
Background	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is in part responsible for the proliferation of cells and exerts its function by signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to the activation of the Map kinase (Mapk) pathways.29–31
Result	Figs. 3A and 4A show representative examples of confocal images of selected, pair-wise labeling of a receptor and a caveolin-1 isoform.
Method	All the data in a particular experiment are normalized to this same data set.
Result	Correspondingly, Fig. 2B shows that EGF stimulation leads to a 37% decrease in the cluster density of the caveolin-1 α and β isoform (detected by clone 2297) (p = 0.013) and that the stimulation with EGF does not significantly alter the cluster density of the caveolin-1 α isoform (detected by clone 2234) (p = 0.96).
Method	It is also known that for homogenous, non-interacting species, where the intensity is a true representation of the concentration, the variance of the normalized intensity fluctuations is equal to the variance of the concentration fluctuations, which in turn is equal to the inverse of the number of particles in the observation area, N̄p.41
Result	Similarly, we show that stimulation with EGF leads to an increase in the co-localization of caveolin-1 α with ErbB1, whereas the co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with ErbB1 remains unchanged.
Conclusion	Our data, obtained by application of a family of image correlation spectroscopy tools, indicate that BMP and EGF stimulation lead to a rearrangement of the caveolin-1 isoforms on the cell surface.
Result	Stimulation by BMP-2 increases the co-localization by about 43% (p = 3.4 × 10−7).
Method	The cells were exposed to BMP-2 for 2.5 h or to 100 ng mL−1 of EGF for 30 min.
Background	Further, starved A431 cells are sensitive to both BMP-2 and EGF stimulation whereas normal A431 cells are less sensitive to BMP-2 stimulation.
Method	After blocking for 30 min with 5% BSA, the cells were incubated with polyclonal antisera recognizing either BRII or BRIa, with polyclonal antibody recognizing the EGFR, or with antibodies recognizing caveolin-1 α (clone 2234) or caveolin-1 α and β (clone 2297) according to manufacturers protocols.
Method	Each of the photomultiplier tubes were set to a black level of 6.0 on the vernier scale and a gain setting of 10.
Method	The filter wheel was set for 488 nm laser excitation to measure Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence, and neutral density filters were used to attenuate the laser to 1% laser power.
Background	Caveolin-1 exists in two isoforms: caveolin-1 alpha (α) and caveolin-1 beta (β).
Method	High magnification confocal images were collected and analyzed by ICCS to yield estimates of the density of receptor clusters, the density of caveolin clusters and the density of clusters that contain both receptor and caveolin (eqn. (7)).
Method	The amplitude of the function obtained from this fit gives the best estimate of g(0,0) for that image.
Conclusion	Whatever the purpose, it is evident that there is an active and dynamic redistribution of caveolin-1 on the cell surface following BMP or EGF stimulation.
Background	Interactions between receptors and regulatory proteins within the domains can, in principle, lead to either activation or inhibition of the corresponding signaling pathways.
Method	By rearrangement, we can define a cluster density of co-localized chromophores as: The fraction of each protein type associated with the other type can finally be estimated by looking at the appropriate ratios of CD values: In eqn. (8), F(g/r) represents the fraction of green labeled protein clusters which contain red labeled proteins.
Background	BMPs need to bind to at least one type-I and one type-II receptor in order to activate the Smad or p38 pathways.18–28
Background	Caveolae enriched in caveolin-1 β are shallower than caveolae containing both caveolin-1 α and β.
Background	Here we provide a brief overview of the techniques and their interpretation.
Method	The A431 cell line (CRL 1555) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassa, VA, USA).).

Method	With this value, the model contains four adjustable parameters, which we extract by non-linear least squares fit from the constants of the nine complexes containing one or two different metal ions (see Table 1).
Method	For the matter of illustration, let us assume that the affinity of the terminal and central sites are the same.
Result	However, as the pair interaction energies between different metal ions are somewhat larger than between the same metal ions, the microscopic constants increase with increasing number of different neighboring metal ions.
Conclusion	An analogous formulation can be applicable when the receptor undergoes conformational transitions.
Method	In other words, the pair interaction energies obey the mixing rule.
Background	In the past, research mainly focussed on mono-center complexes containing a single metal ion and one or more ligands.
Problem	First, we introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies, elucidate the differences between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems, and extend the description to macromolecular receptors.
Method	However, as soon as multi-center complexes are being considered, the number of constants becomes very large, and this approach becomes impractical.
Method	Again, three types of complexes will form.
Result	For the central site we have log K(La)c = 17.91 and log K(EuEu)c = 21.08.
Method	The macroscopic formation constant β20 involves the square of the microconstant, as two metal ions are being bound, the statistical factor of 3, and the pair interaction parameter u, which is related to the pair interaction energy E by E = −kT ln u.
Method	From this expression, the probability of a macrospecies, or in other words its relative concentration, can be expressed as.
Method	The microconstant to remove a metal ion is now given by the inverse of K. Summing up the contributions of both species, we thus find the macroconstant β20 and the conditional probabilities of each microspecies.
Method	The state of all sites can be then described with a state vector si.
Method	Note that the previously introduced binding constant K(λ)j corresponds to the inverse of the microconstant for the release of a metal of type λ from site j when all other sites of the receptor are empty.
Background	In the early fifties, Kirkwood,13 Steiner,14 and Marcus15 had shown how to formulate a site binding model for this situation, and this approach has been extended until recently.16,17
Background	For this reason, a parameterization of these constants in terms of only a few chemically meaningful parameters is necessary.
Method	In order to simplify the structure of the model, let us consider the equilibrium constant of the exchange reaction [LaLa(L2)3]6+ + [EuEu(L2)3]6+ ⇌ 2[LaEu(L2)3]6+.
Result	When both components are in excess, one can show that the model can be again reduced to the linear chain model with the effective pair interaction energy E = E(11) + E(22) − 2E(12)or equivalently.
Problem	As a first example, consider trimetallic complexes of 1,3,5-triamino-1,3,5-trideoxy-cis-inositol (taci) L1H3 with Nd3+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ (see Fig. 1 and 2).11
Method	This conditional probability expresses the relative probability to find a given microstate within a particular macrostate.
Method	The free energy eqn. (1) is a straightforward generalization of the treatment of protonation equilibria.16,17
Method	Let us now consider the long chain limit as the last example.
Result	Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the main features of these isotherms.
Method	The overall binding fraction of the metal ω can be expressed aswhere N is the total number of sites of the receptor.
Method	The macroconstant β10 is given by three times the microconstant K, since each species contributes in the same way.
Method	Let us express the macrostate probability in terms of the microstate probabilities where δn,m is unity for n = m and zero otherwise.
Method	They have to overcome two pair interactions, and thus bind with a microconstant of log K − 2ε.
Conclusion	Thus, one can predict binding constants of metal complexes from a limited set of experimental data.
Method	The intermediate plateau originates from the stabilization of an intermediate structure, where a bound metal ion alternates with an empty site, see Fig. 6(a).
Result	The resulting parameters are the microscopic constants for the terminal sites log K(La)t = 16.70 and log K(Eu)t = 19.10.
Method	These expressions reflect the basic fact that the overall binding isotherms depend on the probabilities of the corresponding macrostates.
Conclusion	In the protein literature,30 this problem is referred to as aggregation of ligands, but a useful parameterization of this problem is not known.
Result	The applicability of the model has been illustrated with examples of lanthanide complexes, namely mixed trimetallic cis-inositol complexes and multi-metallic helicates.
Result	As a consequence, a disordered intermediate structure is formed (Fig. 6(c)).
Method	In order to define this recursion, let us consider a restricted partition function for a sub-chain of length n, such that the values of the state vector of the last site are restricted to given values s, namely where δs,s′ is unity when s = s′ and zero otherwise.
Method	Either one metal ion occupies the central site, and a nearest neighbor pair interaction has to be considered in this case.
Method	These complexes form in water according to the equilibrium 2L1H3 + xNd3+ + ySm3+ + (3 − x − y)Eu3+ ⇌ [NdxSmyEu3−x−y(L1)2]3+ + 6H+where x, y = 0, 1, 2, 3 with x + y ≤ 3 and L13− corresponds to the deprotonated ligand.
Problem	Statistical mechanical approach to competitive binding of metal ions to multi-center receptors
Method	The binding isotherms are then obtained from eqn. (5).
Conclusion	The present formulation certainly represents an appropriate way to treat binding of several metal ions to one type of multi-center receptor.
Method	The complexes with one metal ion has been discussed above, see Fig. 4, while Fig. 8 summarizes the mixed complexes.
Method	However, it is usually more practical to generate this restricted partition function by the application of the transfer matrix to a suitably chosen generating vector Vg such that Ξ1 = TVg.
Result	At high activities of the second metal ion, on the other hand, the second metal exchanges with the first one following an effective repulsive interaction between both metal ions, and leading to an intermediate plateau.
Method	The recursion relation eqn. (19) can be initiated with the partition vector for the first site Ξ1.
Conclusion	However, the general structure of the pair interaction matrix is not obvious at this point.
Result	From this model, the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems enters in a natural way.
Method	In either situation, we have two microstates, depending on the fact whether the two terminal sites are occupied with the same metal ion or with two different ones.
Conclusion	Moreover, more long-range interactions and eventually higher order interactions (e.g., triplets) must be considered.
Method	Consider two metal ions and assume nearest neighbor interactions.
Method	The microconstants to remove each metal ion can be again evaluated by considering the affinities of the metal ions to the sites and by considering the pair interaction, and their inverse values are given in Fig. 7.
Method	When we remove a metal ion of the fully occupied receptor, we overcome the binding constant and two pair interactions, obtaining the inverse of Ku2.
Result	At xEu = 0.1, binary complexes not containing Eu3+ disappear, and the evolution is dominated by the complexes [Eu3(L1)2]3+, [Eu2Sm(L1)2]3+, [EuSm2(L1)2]3+ and [Sm3(L1)2]3+ (see Fig. 11(c)).
Method	Adopting this notation, we assume that the sites are numbered from the left to the right.
Result	At xEu = 0.01, various mixed complexes appear, in particular the mixed ternary complex [NdSmEu(L1)2]3+ (see Fig. 11(b)).
Conclusion	Moreover, one observes that Nd3+ is bound the weakest in the complex, Sm3+ is intermediate, and Eu3+ is bound the strongest.
Method	The macroconstant β30 for the fully occupied receptor involves the cube of the microconstant, three pair interactions, and no statistical factor.
Method	We have further denoted by E(ωη)ij the pair interaction energy between two metal ions ω and η occupying the sites i and j.
Method	Due to symmetry, the microspecies are again equivalent to the macrospecies.
Method	The macroconstant β11 is obtained by realizing that the microspecies has a symmetry number of six.
Method	To introduce the transfer matrix technique, consider a linear structure and nearest neighbor pair range interactions.27
Result	Based on these model parameters, various macroscopic and microscopic properties of these helicates can be predicted.
Result	The fit cannot be substantially improved by allowing for further variation in the interaction parameters.
Problem	The model introduces the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.
Method	There is one complex involving three metal ions, with one from one kind and two from the other kind.
Method	Alternatively, both metal ions occupy the terminal sites.
Method	We simplify the interaction energy matrix further by assuming that the diagonal elements E(ωω) and off-diagonal elements E(ωη) (ω ≠ η) are the same, respectively, leaving us with two pair interaction energies to be determined.
Method	Once the site is occupied with a metal ion, it can no longer bind any others.
Result	The microscopic picture is very simple in this case, as each macrostate consists of a single microstate (see Fig. 12).
Method	Complexes with the first metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the second metal ion, complexes with the second metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the first metal ion, and mixed complexes.
Method	In the absence of interactions, this isotherm reduces to the competitive Langmuir isotherm.
Method	Each macrospecies normally corresponds to a collection of several microspecies.
Background	Nevertheless, it is important to understand this case for our discussion of the multicomponent case.
Method	One also obtains two microspecies when the receptor binds two metal ions.
Method	Equilibrium constants of microscopic equilibria can be discussed in this framework as well.
Method	The cross term E(LaEu) is obtained from eqn. (42).
Method	In long chain limit, the largest eigenvalue cannot be evaluated analytically in the general case.
Method	The binding isotherm for the metal ω and center i can be written as a thermal average over the state variable, namelywhere the thermal average of a function f({si}) is defined as.
Result	We obtain three microscopic constants log K(Nd) = 10.56, log K(Sm) = 12.20, and log K(Eu) = 12.64.
Problem	To test the predictive capabilities of the model, we have calculated the constant of the ternary complex [NdSmEu(L1)2]3+ (see Table 1).
Result	This situation is illustrated with linear chains.
Conclusion	The model therefore captures the interactions between the different lanthanide ions properly.
Result	One further observes that the binding of La3+ is weakened through the presence of neighboring Eu3+ ions.
Method	The important advantage of introducing this conditional probability is that this quantity is a constant and independent of the metal activities.
Method	Since these constants are the same for all three sites, the conditional probability to find the microspecies with the central site occupied is 1/3, while when the terminal site is occupied 2/3.
Method	In the case of linear chain, one can use the transfer matrix technique to obtain these results.
Result	At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor fills up through the alternating full-empty configuration discussed above, see Fig. 6(a).
Result	The measured equilibrium constants11 are reported in Table 1.
Conclusion	In both situations, we find that consideration of pair interactions is important to obtain an acceptable description of the data.
Method	This case leads to two microstates.
Result	One observes that the terminal metal ions are much more tightly bound that the central ones.
Result	The experimental equilibrium constants can be described with the site binding model extremely well (see Table 2).
Method	For this species, which has a symmetry number of 2, it may be necessary to consider the typically weaker next neighbor pair interaction.
Conclusion	With the present approach one can not only treat receptors with a small number of binding sites, but also macromolecular receptors capable of binding a large number of metal ions.
Result	As the concentration ratio [Eu3+]/[La3+] is increased, one goes through the characteristic sequence of the macrospecies [La3(L3)3]9+, [La2Eu(L3)3]9+, [LaEu2(L3)3]9+ and [Eu3(L3)3]9+.
Background	Polyelectrolytes may therefore bind a larger number of metal ions.
Method	For example, for a chain with three sites (N = 3) one obtains Ξ = 1 + 3z + (1 + 2u)z2 + u2z3.
Method	The transfer matrix reads where we have introduced the abbreviations zω = αωK(ω) and uωη = exp(−E(ωη)/kT).
Method	For example, the trimer (N = 3) is now described with a partition function.
Result	At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor again fills up through the alternating full–empty configuration (Fig. 6(a)).
Result	Various examples to illustrate the usefulness of the model are given.
Result	The normalized activity now is z = z1u212/(z2u222) for the first metal ion.
Background	Such charged macromolecules have linear or branched structures, and offer a large number of coordination sites.
Background	Note that this isotherm is identical to the case of proton binding to a polyelectrolyte.15,16,21
Method	The receptor fully occupied with metal ions invokes two nearest neighbor pair interactions, and thus invokes a factor u2.
Method	The situation of a symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites is simple to discuss, see Fig. 3.
Result	Fig. 13 shows the macroscopic properties of the trimetallic helicates with the formula [LaxEu3−x(L3)3]9+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3).
Method	When two metal ions bind to the receptor, there is again only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is also equivalent to the macrostate.
Method	The microscopic binding constant to bind a metal ion to the site will be denoted as K, which is the inverse of the microconstant to remove it.
Method	We assume that the microconstant of these sites is the same for all sites, and will be denoted by K. The inverse of this value corresponds to the microconstant for the removal of the metal ion.
Method	Recall that the binding state of the receptor is uniquely defined with a set of given state variable vectors {si}.
Method	This microspecies invokes a nearest neighbor pair interaction, denoted by the parameter u, and the square of the microconstants.
Method	As will be exemplified below, the advantage of introducing this vector is its simple structure.
Method	This value can be estimated from interaction of an effective charge near +2, which are obtained from ab-initio calculations,29 and calculated for the distance of 3.61 Å invoking the Coulomb law in water.
Method	These isotherms obey the thermodynamic consistency relation
Result	On the other hand, in the macrospecies [LaEu2(L3)3]9+ the symmetric complex [EuLaEu(L3)3]9+ is dominant, while the asymmetric complex [LaEuEu(L3)3]9+ is in minority.
Method	From the known ionization constants of L1H3,28 one can evaluate the conditional constants of these equilibria.
Method	The successive equilibrium constant for the reaction eqn. (16) can be obtained from the free energy difference of these states, and yields the result.
Background	The first two concern small receptors, and the last one the infinite linear chain.
Result	The microconstants to remove the respective metal ions from each site are summarized in Fig. 14.
Background	More recently, attention shifted toward supramolecular multi-center assemblies, which result from the interactions between several ligands and metal ions.1
Method	In the first species, one terminal site and one central site are occupied.
Method	The largest eigenvalue of eqn. (25) can be evaluated analytically as.
Method	Initially, the metal ions bind to the empty sites, and thus with the microconstant log K. Beyond the plateau, the metal ions must bind between two occupied centers.
Method	The off-diagonal terms are now simply approximated by an arithmetic average of the corresponding diagonal terms.
Method	Different binding states of receptors with a small number of sites can be enumerated by hand.
Method	The entire concentration dependence is captured by the macrostate probability.
Method	The model is solved with statistical mechanical techniques, including direct enumeration or transfer matrices.
Background	For this reason, a few major features will be summarized here.
Problem	For this reason, we shall focus on those, but applications to other complexes should be envisioned as well.
Method	In the intermediate situation, one obtains mixed complexes shown in Fig. 7.
Conclusion	However, the parameters considered must be interpreted as thermal averages over the different conformational states.
Problem	The first example is the symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites.
Method	For this reason, we set the diagonal term E(ωω) = 18.7 kJ mol−1.
Method	From these considerations, we obtain the conditional microstate probabilities and the macroconstants shown in Fig. 4.
Problem	The receptor may consist of several preassembled ligands.
Result	The same trend can be also observed for Eu3+, as its binding is also weakened by the presence of neighboring La3+ ions.
Conclusion	While for multi-metallic helicates a simple mixing rule appears to represent a reasonable approximation of the off-diagonal elements of the matrix, for the inositol complexes deviations from this rule are observed.
Method	In particular, the latter can be used to address systems in the limit of large number of sites in a straightforward fashion.
Method	The site binding model now contains the following parameters.
Method	The formation of such macrospecies can be described in terms of a chemical reaction L + nM(1) + mM(2) ⇌ LM(1)nM(2)mwhich can be characterized in terms of macroscopic cumulative equilibrium constants βnm.
Problem	In this publication, we develop this topic further and discuss a site binding model to describe binding of different metal ions to a multi-center receptor with well-defined binding sites, see Fig. 1.
Result	The nearest neighbor pair interaction energies are E(LaLa) = 47.5 kJ mol−1 and E(EuEu) = 69.5 kJ mol−1.
Method	The solution can be expressed in terms of the solution of the linear chain for a single metal ion.
Problem	The model will be first discussed with simple examples, including small and infinitely large receptors.
Method	When three metal ions are bound, two sites are occupied by one type of the metal ion, and the remaining site with the second type.
Method	Given the free energy of the metal–receptor complex, we can express the semi-grand canonical partition function as26where the sum extends over all possible states {si}.
Method	The partition function is asymptotically given by Ξ ∼ λN for N → ∞If the largest eigenvalue cannot be found analytically, it can be easily calculated numerically.
Method	The latter can be obtained by expanding the partition function in terms of the activities a1 and a2, and as the result one obtains the binding polynomial.
Background	This paper is structured as follows.
Method	From these macrospecies probabilities, the binding isotherms can be directly obtained as.
Method	Based on the present description, one can obtain expressions for equilibrium constants for the chemical equilibria between different species.
Method	Some algebra leads to the closed form of the adsorption isotherm where θ(z) is the mono-component isotherm given by eqn. (29) evaluated at z = z1 + z2.
Background	These aspects will be the subject of future studies.
Method	For finite oligomers, one recovers the classical description in terms of chemical equilibria, and the corresponding protonation constants can be expressed in terms of microscopic binding constants and pair interaction energies.17
Method	Obviously, there are only mixed complexes with two or three metal ions.
Background	A classical topic, where such questions arise, are acid–base equilibria of polyelectrolytes (i.e., proton binding).
Method	This model is equivalent to the so-called Ising model, which is amply discussed in the statistical mechanics literature.27
Background	Again, such systems cannot be described by a small number of complexation constants, and an alternative approach is needed.
Method	To remove a metal ion, there are two different microconstants as the terminal site involves only one pair interaction, and the central one two.
Method	The formation constants to be analyzed are summarized in Table 2.
Method	With eqns. (23) and (5), an analytical expression of the binding isotherm of a linear chain follows θ(z) = [2 + (λ(z)/z)(1 − zu)/(1 − u + λ(z)u)]−1.
Result	The binding isotherm of the second metal shows an interesting transition region, as the isotherm becomes steep in the intermediate activity regime.
Method	Due to Coulombic forces between charged metal ions, the interactions are repulsive and Eij > 0.
Result	This process follows the one-to-one exchange isotherm since there is no difference in the interactions between the two metal ions.
Background	One encounters a similar problem, when one attempts to interpret the binding of metal ions by polyelectrolytes.21–25
Method	In the case of a single metal ion, equivalent sites, and nearest neighbor interactions, the transfer matrix is given by16,21,27 where we have introduced the reduced activity z = αK.The two supplementary (transposed) partition vectors are Ṽg = (1,0) and Ṽt = (1, 1).
Method	The chemical potential term µ can be related to the metal ion activity a and the microscopic binding constant K of the metal to a binding center when all other centers are empty by µ = kT ln aK.
Background	To approach such questions, microscopic site binding models have been proposed to address the competition between protons and multi-dentate metal binding to polyelectrolytes.21
Problem	Let us now present the treatment of two types of metal ions using the three examples already discussed.
Method	In this situation, the state vector has only one element, and the index ω can be suppressed.
Result	Predictive capabilities of the site binding model were illustrated with the inositol complexes.
Method	The partition function can be now written in a compact fashion as Ξ = ṼtTNVg.
Method	The same complexes form with the second metal ion, when the activity of the first metal ion is small.
Method	By arranging the elements of the restricted partition function Ξn(s) into a column vector Ξn, the transfer matrix T can be defined as Ξn + 1 = TΞn.
Method	We choose pH 8 as reference.
Method	In the absence of interactions (E = 0 or u = 1), this isotherm reduces to the familiar Langmuir isotherm.
Method	Consider a receptor with several binding sites, each of which can bind a single metal ion.
Method	Usually this vector contains unit entries, and one can write eqn. (20) as a scalar product Ξ = ṼtΞNwhere Ṽt denotes the transposed (row) vector.
Result	The off-diagonal pair interaction turns out to be E(ωη) = 19.4 kJ mol−1 (ω ≠ η) and recall that we set E(ωω) = 18.7 kJ mol−1.
Method	When we consider nearest neighbor interactions only, we now have two pair interaction energies, namely E(LaLa), E(EuEu).
Method	With increasing repulsive interactions, it develops a two-hump structure with an intermediate plateau at θ = 1/2.
Method	For repulsive interactions, the first hump in the binding isotherm is located at log a = log K, while the second hump at log a = log K −2ε where ε = −log10u = E/(kTln10).
Method	The inverse values of the various microconstants to remove the respective metal ions are also indicated.
Background	The partial rationalization of the formation of the heterobimetallic and trimetallic complexes represents a first step toward this goal.6–11
Result	On the top of both figures, the binding isotherm for the first metal ion is shown as a function of its activity for fixed activities of the second metal ion.
Conclusion	This effect is mainly caused by the additional electrostatic repulsion between the sites.
Method	Note that the pair interaction energy is symmetric upon exchange of the indices ω and η, as well as i and j.
Method	Since all the sites are equivalent, there is only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is equivalent to the macrostate.
Method	For an infinite polyelectrolyte chain, the binding isotherms can be evaluated by standard techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics.
Result	An example of unequal interaction parameters is shown in Fig. 10.
Result	Fig. 14 summarizes their microscopic properties.
Method	Based on this formulation, many properties of finite and infinite chains can be obtained in a straightforward way.
Result	We obtain microscopic and macroscopic complexation constants, microstate probabilities, and binding isotherms for chain-like receptors, including the long-chain limit.
Background	The latter bottom-up process necessitates an exploitation and modelling of the experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on complexation reactions.
Method	The complex with two different metal ions involves one pair interaction energy E(12), and this interaction will be abbreviated with the parameter u12.
Method	This reaction corresponds to a microscopic equilibrium, where the site j eliminates a metal of type λ, but the binding state of the rest of receptor remains unchanged.
Result	The macrospecies [La2Eu(L3)3]6+ consists of the two microspecies, the dominant asymmetric complex [EuLaLa(L3)3]9+ and the symmetric minority complex [LaEuLa(L3)3]9+.
Result	For each mixed complex (macrospecies), there are two possible structures (microspecies), each of which has always a fixed relative fraction within the macrostate.
Result	At high activities of the second metal ion, the second metal exchanges with the first one.
Result	The experimental value of its common logarithm is 25.90 and the model predicts 25.98.
Background	Let us now consider three examples.
Problem	A microscopic site binding model to treat binding of several metal ions to multi-center receptors is proposed.
Conclusion	In both cases, the model is able to predict all details of the microscopic equilibria, including microstate probabilities and microscopic equilibrium constants.
Method	This complex involves three pair interactions, namely one between the same metal ions, and two between different ones.
Background	From this model description, we can extract various properties of interest.
Result	The results for the analytically soluble case with equal interaction parameters are shown in Fig. 9.
Conclusion	In this paper, we have presented a microscopic site binding model treating binding of several metal ions to preassembled multi-center receptors with well-defined binding sites within a statistical mechanical framework.
Method	Complexes will form only with the first metal ion, provided the activity of the second metal ions is small, see Fig. 3.
Method	The location of these humps is simply understood.
Background	Examples of such complexes are shown in Fig. 1, and the structure of the ligands in Fig. 2.
Result	The example of the multi-metallic helicates did show that from a homologous series one can obtain a sufficient number of experimental quantities in order to fix the model parameters.
Background	This situation is completely analogous to the situation of proton binding discussed in detail elsewhere.14–17
Method	In the situation of identical sites and nearest neighbor interactions the free energy is given by where µ is a chemical potential term, and Eij is the pair interaction energy between the sites i and j.
Method	Ercolani's work12 focusses exactly on this problem, as he attempts to express formation constants of multi-center complexes in terms of two intrinsic constants and symmetry numbers.
Result	For the situation shown in Fig. 9 a random structure forms (E = 0), while in the one shown in Fig. 10 the alternating structure forms (E = 15 kJ mol−1 > 0).
Method	For the sake of simplicity, let us consider two types of metal ions M(1) and M(2) only.
Method	Again, by equating the coefficients of eqn. (32) with eqn. (8) one obtains the macroscopic binding constants βnm, as shown in Figs. 4 and 8.
Method	In the absence of interactions, the isotherm has the classical sigmoidal shape in the semi-logarithmic representation.
Method	Larger systems can be either treated by Monte Carlo simulation, or certain structures by transfer matrix techniques.27
Background	For example, dendrimers have been reported to complex several hundreds of copper(ii) ions.22
Background	Proper understanding of these processes is essential for stimulating molecular programming, and for switching from the usual deductive chemical approach toward induction.3
Method	The second example involves a linear receptor, with two equivalent terminal sites, and one central site, see Fig. 4.
Method	In order to apply the site binding model, which treats the binding of metal ions to one receptor, we consider the conditional equilibrium 2L1tot + xNd3+ + ySm3+ + (3 − x − y)Eu3+ ⇌ [NdxSmyEu3−x−y(L1)2]3+where L1tot refers to all solution species of the ligand.
Result	One observes that the exchange between Eu3+ and La3+ occurs in a relatively narrow concentration range.
Method	The macroconstants β12 and β21 of both complexes follow by taking into account the symmetry number of three.
Result	The macrostate probabilities are displayed as a function of the free concentration ratio [Sm3+]/[Nd3+], where the free concentrations have been set equal to the activities for simplicity.
Background	The recent design of heterometallic f–f′ complexes evidencing large deviations from statistical distributions in solution demonstrates the need for mathematical models of multi-center complexation processes.5
Conclusion	This result can be considered as very satisfactory, since the model was calibrated on binary systems only.
Conclusion	As long as all complexes are composed of the same number of ligands (e.g., helicates) the present approach applies.
Background	We note that the complexes [La2(L3)3]6+ and [Eu2(L3)3]6+ have been also described, but their structure is probably rather different, and they are not considered here.7
Method	Thereby, one introduces a recursion relation between the partition function of a chain with n sites and with n + 1.
Method	Note that this mixing rule imposes no effective interactions in the saturated state (cf. eqn. (36)).
Method	The inverse microconstant for removing a metal ion involves the binding constant K and one pair interaction u.
Conclusion	Further experimental data sets are necessary to settle such questions in detail.
Background	However, the thermodynamic basis of the formation mechanisms of such complexes is poorly understood, and has not been addressed in much detail so far.
Method	There are three nonequivalent microstates, each of which has a symmetry number of two.
Method	The transfer matrix formalism can be extended to competitive metal binding to linear receptors in a straightforward fashion.
Method	Normally, these include microscopic binding constants for each site and site–site pair interaction energies.
Result	In the absence of Eu3+, one observes the classical evolution from the [Nd3(L1)2]3+ complex, through the mixed binary complexes [Nd2Sm(L1)2]3+ and [NdSm2(L1)2]3+, to the [Sm3(L1)2]3+ complex (see Fig. 11(a)).
Result	On the bottom, the isotherm for the second metal is shown in the same representation.
Method	The generalization of the following arguments to an arbitrary number of metal ions is straightforward.
Method	Since only the complexes with three lanthanide ions exist, one cannot estimate both interaction energies independently.
Method	However, an analytical solution is possible if we specialize to the important case of equal pair interactions, namely u11 = u12 = u22 = u.
Result	The macrostate probabilities, which are normalized to the total concentration of the saturated complexes, are shown in Fig. 13a.
Problem	Multi-center complexes of lanthanides provide good examples for the mechanisms discussed here.
Method	The latter factor of two arises since there are two equivalent terminal sites.
Method	To remove a metal ion from this species, the inverse microconstant involves a factor K and we eliminate a pair interaction, which involves a factor u.
Method	The free energy of a microscopic protonation state is expressed in terms of a small number of parameters.
Method	In the other microspecies, both terminal sites are occupied.
Method	Consider now a chemical equilibrium between two species L({s′i}) ⇌ L({si})the state vectors of which are identical with the exception of the elements sj(λ)j = 0 and s′(λ)j = 1.
Problem	In the last section the applicability of the model to experimental binding constants is illustrated.
Method	Two macrospecies are possible, depending whether there are two metal ions of type one or of type two.
Result	Fig. 13(b) shows the relative fraction of metal bound in the trimetallic helicates.
Method	These three microspecies have to be considered, when the macroconstant β11 of the complex with two different metal ions is evaluated.
Method	Within this transitions, the metal ions cluster together, see Fig. 6(b).
Method	To analyze the formation constants, we assume that the bimetallic and trimetallic complexes have equal interactions, and thus we use the whole series to extract the microscopic parameters.
Conclusion	This observation is consistent with NMR results, since the two minority complexes could not be detected.8
Problem	As a second example, consider the monometallic and bimetallic helicates of the general formula [LaxEuy(L2)3]3(x+y)+ (x, y = 0, 1, 2) and trimetallic helicates of the formula [LaxEu3−x(L3)3]9+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, see Fig. 1 and 2).7,8
Background	In this context, multi-metal supramolecular lanthanide complexes are particularly interesting, as the search for new receptors displaying selective binding along the 4f-block series provides a substantial database of macroscopic and microscopic stability constants.4
Method	This behavior of this isotherm is shown in Fig. 5.
Background	Interactions of metal ions with ligands represent an important topic in coordination chemistry.
Method	There are two possible microstates, when one binds one metal ion to the receptor, namely either to the terminal site or to the central site.
Method	This exchange constant has been shown to be 4 within experimental error,7 meaning that the fraction in eqn. (41) can be well approximated by unity.
Method	Commonly, solution equilibria are described in terms of macrospecies, where only the total number and type of metal ions are specified, but it is not specified to which site they are bound.
Conclusion	Naturally, once the macroscopic constants are known, the macrostate probabilities can be computed (see Fig. 11).
Result	Consideration of a next nearest neighbor interaction energy gives equally no effect.
Method	However, this interaction will be neglected here.
Conclusion	On the other hand, when the complexes contain different numbers of sub-units, the present approach must be generalized in order to incorporate this situation.
Result	Depending on the magnitude of the individual interactions, at intermediate loading one can obtain random arrangements for E = 0, alternating arrangements for E > 0, or clustering of the same metal ions for E < 0 (see Fig. 6).
Result	This effect leads to a destabilization of the metal ions in the mixed complexes (see Fig. 12).
Method	The formation of metal–ligand complexes can be quantified in terms of chemical equilibria and the corresponding complexation constants.
Method	Inserting eqn. (26) in eqn. (27) and comparing term-by-term with eqn. (8) the macroscopic binding constants βn0 follow, in agreement with Fig. 4.
Method	Again, the properties of short chains can be evaluated analytically.
Method	The site binding model introduces three microscopic binding constants K(Nd), K(Sm) and K(Eu) and six pair interaction energies E(ωη).
Result	Independent fit of the off-diagonal terms gives a value of the off-diagonal terms, which is very close to the value predicted by the mixing rule eqn. (42), and leads to no improvement to the fit.
Background	Researchers have focussed on the preparation and structural characterization of sophisticated metallo-supramolecular architectures, which can be obtained in high-yield by the simple mixing of the various components (i.e., self-assembly).2
Method	The total concentration of the three metals was set to 0.1 M and the overall mole fraction xEu of the Eu3+-ion was fixed.
Method	The macroscopic formation constant β10 involves a statistical factor of 3, since there are three sites on which the metal ion can bind to the receptor.
Conclusion	In most situations, however, the receptor is composed of different ligands, which have to assemble in order to form the complex.
Method	If a metal ion of type ω is bound to a site i, the corresponding element of the state vector s(ω)i is defined to be unity, and all the other elements are zero.
Result	The intermediate structure is again alternating (Fig. 6(d)).
Method	The macroconstants β12 and β21 are again obtained by considering the pair interactions and the symmetry numbers.
Method	The microconstants follow as above.
Background	The experimentally inclined reader is welcome to proceed to this section directly.
Method	The probability of such a species (i.e., its relative concentration) can be written as.
Method	Again, this operation can be formulated in a matrix notation, by defining a terminating vector Vt.
Method	The partition functions can be evaluated by inserting these quantities into eqn. (22).
Method	With attractive interactions, a sharp transition takes place.
Method	The partition function of the entire chain can be then obtained by summing over all the states of the sub-chain.
Method	A microspecies is defined with a set of given state variable vectors {si}.
Method	These six parameters can be extracted from the nine constants given in Table 2.
Method	This parameterization appears to be the appropriate one to obtain the necessary simplification of the description of acid–base equilibria of polyprotic acids or bases.18–20
Method	As will be discussed in the following, transfer matrices have simple forms for nearest neighbor pair interactions.
Method	Larger structures can be enumerated on a computer, even though the number of sites accessible with this technique remains limited to about 20–30.
Method	In the general case, when u11 ≠ u12 ≠ u22 the isotherm can be found numerically by evaluating the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.
Result	These conditional constants are given in Table 1, and only those will be considered further.
Method	The generating and terminating vectors are given by Ṽg = (1,0,0) and Ṽt = (1,1,1).
Method	In the presence of two metal ions, three types of complexes form.
Method	To a first approximation, the effective free energy of the metal-receptor complex can be written as a general linear and quadratic expression in the state variables, namely17,21,26 where the chemical potential term can be related to the activity of metal αω as µ(ω)i = kT ln αωK(ω)i, where K(ω)i is the microscopic association constant of the center i for the metal of type ω, and kT the thermal energy.
Method	From this expression we find that the probability of the microspecies can be split into two terms, namely, p({si}) = π({si}|nm)Pnm(α1,α2)the macrostate probability Pnm(α1,α2), and the conditional microstate probability where the Kronecker's δn,m is unity for n = m and zero otherwise.
Method	Let us now consider the second example of the linear receptor with three sites, which has two equivalent terminal sites and one central site.
Method	For example, the long chain limit is typically dominated with the largest eigenvalue λ of the transfer matrix T.
Result	We introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.
Method	These include microscopic binding constants for both metal ions to the terminal site K(La)t and K(Eu)t and to the central site K(La)c and K(Eu)c.

Background	Brandts12 and Pohl13,14 proposed that the driving force for stabilizing the protein folded conformation is a non-specific solvation effect in which the preferential exclusion of the co-solvents from the protein surface arises from enhanced water ordering (structure makers).
Method	As the technique has been introduced quite recently only,17,26–28,31 we briefly summarize the thermodynamics on which it is based.
Problem	The present study aims to obtain more insight into the basic thermodynamic properties of protein solvation and volume effects accompanying unfolding scenarios on one hand, and on the other hand, to initiate further potential applications of pressure perturbation calorimetry in studies of biomolecular systems in general.
Background	Under these conditions, the K2SO4 specific binding tendency is reduced.
Conclusion	Since the ΔV is of larger absolute value as the temperature decreases, increasing urea concentration results automatically in a larger absolute value of ΔV.
Result	In contrast to the osmolytes glycerol and sorbitol, the apparent expansion coefficient of the protein in the native state is smaller than that of the protein in pure buffer solution, however.
Background	Increasing thermal energy, however, allows the water molecules to free themselves from this expanded ordered solvation state.
Problem	The effect of solvation strength on the temperature dependence of α, which is largely controlled by protein–solvent interactions, should be expected to change significantly upon replacing H2O for D2O as solvent.
Method	The reference and sample cell volume are identical (0.51 mL) and they open to a common pressure chamber containing a sensor.
Result	As expected, the Tm value decreases with increasing urea concentration, for example Tm(1.5 M urea) = 39.1 °C, Tm(2.5 M urea) = 32.5 °C (Table 1).
Background	The use of co-solvents such as glycerol and sucrose have been used widely, primarily because of their ability to stabilize the folded proteins through a mechanism that does not involve direct contact, but rather their preferential exclusion from the protein surface.11
Result	Thus, the present determination of α as a function of temperature using PPC is in good agreement with the previous observations based on a determination of the specific volume by densimetry, which had to be carried out at a much higher (20×) protein concentration, however.
Result	The volume change of unfolding is drastically reduced for the glycerol solvent systems (e.g., ca.
Method	Differentiation with respect to pressure, at constant T, gives (∂Qrev/∂p)T = T (∂S/∂p)T.
Method	The protein purification was carried out according to the method described by Shortle and Meeker40 with modifications described by Frye et al.41
Conclusion	Secondly, upon unfolding of the surface, the protein becomes more hydrophobic because the native structure tends to bury more of the hydrophobic side chains in the interior.
Result	We find an increase in Cp of 5.7 ± 0.2 kJ mol−1 K−1 between the unfolded and native state.
Conclusion	Another contribution may be that increasing urea concentration leads to a more completely unfolded state.
Background	Direct densimetric measurements on Snase as a function of temperature and pressure36 revealed that below the unfolding transition temperature at atmospheric pressure, the slope of the change in specific volume with temperature exhibits a distinct downward curvature, indicating that the apparent thermal expansivity of the native state of the solvated protein decreases with increasing temperature.
Problem	Here, we looked at the role of the cosmotropic salt K2SO4 in a solvent environment where the net charge of the protein is still small.
Result	Tm and the enthalpy change of the transition (ΔH) are obtained from the DSC experiments (Fig. 2b).
Method	5 wt%) to 3.5 M (ca.
Background	Near pH 5.5, K2SO4 is still left with little chance to bind strongly to the protein.
Background	Unfortunately, the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of the unfolded state cannot be determined at temperatures below the transition temperature, while that of the folded state cannot be determined at temperatures above the transition temperature.
Result	Between 10 and 40 °C, the apparent thermal expansion coefficient of the protein, α, decreases almost linearly from 1.0 × 10−3 K−1 to a value near 0.65 × 10−3 K−1.
Conclusion	Solutions of the cosmotropic and chaotropic compounds glycerol, sorbitol, K2SO4 and urea, respectively, show characteristic deviations from the thermal expansion and volumetric properties of the pure buffer solution.
Conclusion	This effect is already clearly observed when the thermodynamic data obtained using water as solvent are compared with those of a chemically structurally similar solvent, D2O. The increase in thermal stability of the protein in the presence of D2O can be understood to be due to an increase in solvation around the protein as indicated by the much larger α value in the native state of the protein.
Background	The thermal expansivity of the protein interior has been measured over a limited temperature range, essentially using fluorescence and X-ray diffraction (on single crystals),57–60 and the changes observed are rather small.
Problem	9 wt%) and 1.5 M (ca.
Background	Yet, the sulfate anions are still able to decrease the hydration layer around the protein.
Background	For sugars (e.g., sucrose), glycerol and polyhydric alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycerol, sorbitol), the preferential hydration was found to induce also protein stabilization.
Background	These values are taken as a reference to compare relative SASAs in the presence of the various co-solvents.
Background	Moreover, even though it is negative at low temperatures, the absolute value of the volume change upon unfolding is quite small.
Conclusion	The negative volume change upon unfolding observed under most conditions implies that at the transition temperature, the opening of void volume and the increase in accessible surface area with more charged and polar groups upon unfolding overcompensate the positive effects of thermal volume and the decrease in the hydrophilic to hydrophobic balance of the surface area.
Background	The solvation effect also represents a positive contribution to the thermal expansivity, but is expected to decrease with increasing temperature.
Result	In the present study, it is seen that this temperature range corresponds to the tail end of the transition, and thus to the region of rollover in which dα/dT ≈ 0 before changing sign.
Background	As a result, the volume fraction occupied by the co-solvent at the surface of the protein should be less than that in the bulk solvent.
Conclusion	In this case, ΔV is found to be positive which is an indication of the formation of a swollen, molten globule kind of unfolded state at the transition.
Result	In this regard, sorbitol is the more efficient agent.
Conclusion	On the contrary, the chaotropic agent urea destabilizes the protein by direct ligand binding and restricts direct water contact with the protein surface.
Result	30% less than that of the Snase–H2O (buffer) system.
Background	Indeed, addition of osmolyte stabilizes the folded state, such that the Tm (the temperature at which ΔV is measured in the present experiments) increases with increasing glycerol concentration.
Conclusion	The surface term may reflect two contributions: Firstly, since charged or polar surface-affected water is supposed to be condensed, this will give rise to a negative contribution to ΔV.
Background	It is possible, however, that differences in ΔV values may also arise from differences in the structure of the denatured states at high temperature as compared to high pressure.
Method	Using the Maxwell relation (∂S/∂p)T = −(∂V/∂T)p, we obtain eqn. (1): where V is the volume and α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p.
Background	Thus at low temperatures, the solvation effect (in particular, of the polar/charged peptide groups) leads to large positive contributions to α and will decrease steeply with increasing temperature.
Result	Above that temperature, α increases again to a relatively constant level in the post-transition temperature range.
Result	Beyond a concentration of 1.5 M of urea, it is not possible to calculate ΔV accurately as the protein does not denaturate in a cooperative manner anymore.
Result	The PPC results of Snase dissolved at various molar concentrations of glycerol in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.5 are shown in Fig. 4a.
Background	Indeed, urea destabilizes the folded state of the protein leading to a decrease in the Tm as a function of increasing urea concentration.
Conclusion	In the case of K2SO4, above 80 °C, however, its expansivity becomes smaller than that of pure water, which is likely due to the “structure making” effect of the salt.
Result	6% and ca.
Background	40 °C.34,61
Method	The compensation power returns to the baseline typically within one minute and integration of the supplied power vs. time yields the heat consumed or released by the sample.
Result	The uncertainties in α determined from at least three measurements using different sample preparations is ±0.05 × 10−3 K−1.
Method	The glycerol concentration in the buffer was varied from 0.5 M (ca.
Result	Nonetheless, since Δα is positive at the transition temperature, the expansivity of the unfolded state is higher than that of the folded state at the transition.
Result	The shift in Tm value, e.g., from 51.5 to 58.6 °C in 1.5 M sorbitol (53.7 °C in 1.5 M glycerol) indicates the more effective stabilising effect of sorbitol compared to glycerol.
Result	The increase in Tm value is clearly an evidence of the stabilization of the folded state, arising from the energetically unfavourable increase in preferential hydration due to the increase in exposed surface area upon unfolding.
Background	This behaviour is due to the fact that the protein surface binds adjacent water.
Method	From the second law of thermodynamics we know that an entropy change for a reversible process carried out at temperature T, whose heat change is dQrev, can be written as dS = dQrev/T.
Method	Here it is assumed that V and α are nearly invariant within small pressure changes (here 5 bar), which is a very good approximation for all liquids.
Method	The experiment thus yields the difference in expansivity between the protein solution (sample cell) and the buffer (reference cell).
Conclusion	We clearly demonstrate that solvation properties contribute extensively towards the stability of proteins.
Result	The values of ΔV and ΔCp are also smaller for these co-solvents.
Background	Glycerol and other polyolic co-solvents have been shown to lead to a “preferential hydration” of the protein, i.e. the exclusion of the co-solvent molecules from the protein surface.
Background	Since Snase has an extraordinarily large number of ionisable residues (39%), it exhibits very large values of α and |(dα/dT)10–40|.
Method	The temperature of the cell is kept constant by active compensation of the heat change caused by the pressure jump.
Background	However, the acid denaturation studies may include significant electrostriction effects.
Problem	A rather new technique, pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC), was applied to study volumetric and solvation properties of staphylococcal nuclease (Snase) in its native and unfolded state with high precision.
Conclusion	The apparent expansion coefficient of the protein, α, is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of co-solvent and its interactions with functional groups of the polypeptide.
Result	The present more accurate studies are in good agreement with these earlier observations, as they demonstrate a marked decrease in α between 4 and 40 °C, below the transition temperature.
Background	A similar but inverse explanation may also hold for the observed increase in the absolute value of ΔV as a function of increasing urea concentration.
Background	At reduced protein surface charge and at higher anion concentrations, the Hofmeister effects46,55 prevail, however.
Method	Potassium sulfate (K2SO4), deuterium oxide (D2O) were obtained from Aldrich, urea and D-sorbitol from Fluka, and glycerol from Merck.
Result	In the native state, the protein shows a very strong thermal expansion of 1.0 × 10−3 K−1 at 10 °C, which decreases steeply to 0.65 × 10−3 K−1 at 40 °C.
Conclusion	As the temperature increases, water molecules are released from the surface and the value of the thermal expansivity is reduced.
Problem	In the present paper, we examine these perturbations in the hydration layer around a protein caused by addition of co-solvents using a relatively new and efficient technique called pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC).17,26–28
Method	The observed volume and expansivity changes are correlated with further thermodynamic properties obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Result	The comparison of the (dα/dT)10–40 value of Snase–3.5 M glycerol (−2.4 × 10−5 K−2) with that of Snase–H2O (−1.17 × 10−5 K−2) in buffer solution indicates that the addition of glycerol contributes to a ca.
Background	Some specific anions are known to induce the formation of molten globule forms in proteins, for example from acid-unfolded proteins.54
Background	Our previous data were not of high enough quality to determine whether this temperature dependence of ΔV was linear or non-linear.
Background	Aliphatic side chains, for example, are known to have even negative apparent thermal expansion coefficients, α, at low temperatures (near 0 °C) with a large positive temperature coefficient.
Background	Our earlier densimetric measurements also revealed an increase in the apparent value of the expansivity between 45 and 65 °C, consistent with a positive value for Δα.
Method	Degassing was performed at a slightly reduced atmospheric pressure and for a short time only, so that no concentration changes occurred.
Result	33% reduction in ΔV (ΔV = −12.7 mL mol−1 for Snase–D2O).
Result	The solutions with 0.5 M glycerol, sorbitol, urea, and K2SO4 exhibit a greater thermal expansion compared to pure water (shown for comparison), in particular at low temperature.
Result	The increase in glycerol concentration leads to a drastic increase of the thermal expansivity at 10 °C due to the preferential hydration, even though the total amount of water in the system is reduced with increasing glycerol concentration.
Result	This is supported by the reduction in the enthalpy values of denaturation, ΔH, as calculated from the DSC data, which are shown in Fig. 6b.
Method	10 mM of phosphate buffer (di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, from Merck) was used for all experiments.
Result	The absolute volume change upon unfolding, ΔV, can be calculated from ΔV/V using the molar mass of Snase (16 812 Da) and its partial specific volume (0.754 mL g−1)33 which yields ΔV = −19 mL mol−1, which is of the order of −0.15% of the whole system.
Conclusion	The reduction of ΔV in the presence of these stabilisers can in part be attributed to the formation of a partial unfolded state of the protein, in part it is due to the temperature dependence of ΔV.
Background	We note in contrast to this explanation, that another effective denaturant, guanidinium hydrochloride, had no effect on the value of the volume change of unfolding obtained in the pressure-induced unfolding of Snase at 21 °C,69 indicating that such solvation effects do not play a role in the value of the volume change under those high pressure conditions.
Result	From the PPC experiments it is clear that the shift in the Tm value from 51.5 to 59.5 °C is an indication that the salt acts as a strong stabilising agent.
Result	Such a scheme of the individual contributing factors to the volume change upon unfolding changes as a function of temperature.
Problem	This behaviour is discussed in terms of a continuous release of condensed water from the protein surface.
Conclusion	This volume increase at the unfolding transition could be due to the formation of a protein conformation which is not fully unfolded but rather achieves a flexible, expanded state only, which might be a molten globule kind of structure.
Result	The Tm values as obtained by DSC also decrease with increasing urea concentration and are in good agreement with the values obtained by the PPC method.
Result	The values of Tm from DSC (Fig. 4b) and PPC are in good agreement.
Background	At 40 °C, the ΔV was near −65 ± 10 mL mol−1, whereas at 45 °C it had decreased in absolute value to −37 mL mol−1.
Background	For charged and polar groups, α(T) curves exhibit a large negative slope and a positive curvature.
Conclusion	It can be supposed that this effect counteracts the first one to some extent.
Result	The PPC and DSC results on Snase–urea solutions displayed in Fig. 6 are in agreement with these general findings.
Result	This is not to say that the intrinsic expansivity of the protein is negligible, but simply that the protein interior does not appear to contribute significantly to the decrease in expansivity with increasing temperature (see below).
Result	The enthalpy change obtained by integration over the DSC peak amounts to 178 ± 5 kJ mol−1.
Background	Lin et al17. proposed that the dα/dT value of a protein in its native state is a direct measure of the solvation contribution to the volume expansivity.
Conclusion	The experimental Δα and ΔCp values of −0.03 × 10−3 K−1 and ca. −9.5 kJ mol−1 K−1 (Table 1), respectively, point to no drastic increase in SASA in the denatured state, again indicative of a less unfolded and hence less hydrophobically hydrated structure in the denatured state.
Background	Such ligand interactions can be studied based on determining the solvent accessible surface area (SASA).15,16
Method	The reference cell was filled with matching buffer.
Background	Densimetric studies are often not of sufficient sensitivity to reveal these changes in solvation properties or volume changes upon unfolding of proteins.22–25
Background	The thermal volume at the protein solvent interface and the intrinsic volume of the protein increase with temperature leading to a positive contribution to α.
Conclusion	In the case of urea, an increase in absolute ΔV values is observed at the unfolding transition, which is an indication that the protein tends to form a rather extended structure, and the solvation properties at the protein surface are probably largely determined by binding of urea.
Problem	Furthermore, the effects of various chaotropic and cosmotropic co-solvents on the solvation and unfolding behaviour of Snase was investigated in detail.
Background	Early work on metmyoglobin66 and ribonuclease67 and later on Snase as noted above34 has also shown that the pressure effect decreases in magnitude with increasing temperature, and may even change sign, i.e., the partial specific volume of the unfolded state becomes larger than that of the folded state at high temperature and pressure can induce folding, rather than unfolding under these conditions.
Result	High α values at lower temperatures (1.0 × 10−3 K−1 at 10 °C) and their steep decrease up to 40 °C (dα/dT)10–40 = −1.17 × 10−5 K−2) are indicative of the presence of a large number of structure-breaking hydrophilic side chains on the surface of Snase.17
Conclusion	The preferential binding of urea reduces the hydration level, also in the native state, causing the protein to approach a more disordered state at high urea concentration.
Method	An equal pressure of 5 bar was applied to both cells in a programmed manner using nitrogen gas.
Background	Another important factor contributing to the stability of proteins is their relative affinity towards a particular reagent (in the present context, a co-solvent) in comparison to water or buffer solution.
Result	295 kJ mol−1 obtained from the DSC results indicates the drastically increased stability of the protein in the K2SO4 buffer solution.
Background	Indeed, glycerol has been found to decrease the specific volume and the adiabatic compressibility of the protein interior, suggesting that the mechanism involves the collapse of voids in the protein core following a glycerol-induced elimination of flexibility-associated (“lubricant”) water.45
Result	The steady increment of Tm and ΔH in the glycerol containing buffer solutions, up to 56 °C and ΔH ≈ ∼260 kJ mol−1 for the 3.5 M glycerol containing solution (Table 1), confirms the continuous increase in protein stability with increasing glycerol concentration.
Method	The instrument is also equipped with a pressuring cap that allows application of ca.
Background	This might be due to the fact that relatively more aliphatic side chains of the protein are exposed to the solvent in the unfolded state, and the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of aliphatic side chains is opposite to that of the polar side chains and peptide bonds, given the fact that the aliphatic groups tend to promote a higher degree of structure in the water of solvation than exists in bulk water.17
Conclusion	At low temperature, the volume change upon unfolding, ΔV, is negative because elimination of internal cavities and electrostrictive effects around exposed polar groups upon unfolding offset the positive contributions of exposure of hydrophobic groups and the larger thermal volume of the unfolded state.
Result	The PPC results are shown in Fig. 5a and indicate that the hydration changes and stabilisation due to sorbitol are even higher than those for the corresponding concentrations of glycerol (Table 1).
Result	208 kJ mol−1) and Tm (59 °C) values obtained from the DSC data, which are shown in Fig. 5b, are in good agreement with the conclusions drawn from the PPC results.
Method	Moreover, the relative volume changes ΔV/V at the unfolding transition, taking place in the temperature range from To to Te, can be obtained by eqn. (3):
Background	Irrespective of whether co-solvents directly interact with or are preferentially excluded from the protein surface, they induce definite changes in the quantity of bound water and its associated properties, such as hydrogen-bonded structure, and chemical potential.18–22
Conclusion	The solvation effects leading to the strong temperature dependence of α are controlled by two contributions.
Conclusion	Similarly to D2O, a continuous increase in solvation was observed with increase in glycerol or sorbitol content in the buffer, which leads to an increase in protein stability, as is verified by the increasing Tm and ΔH values obtained by microcalorimetric measurements (DSC).
Result	39%, respectively, when compared to Snase–H2O (buffer).
Result	The values of the expansion coefficients of the solvents, αsolv, measured for the phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M co-solvents are shown in Fig. 1.
Result	Interestingly, the ΔV values of Snase–0.5 M urea and Snase–1.5 M urea buffer solutions with −32 and −56 mL mol−1, respectively, are much greater than those of Snase in the pure buffer solution.
Conclusion	Moreover, the water-accessible surface area becomes larger upon unfolding, thus increasing the number of water molecules being affected.
Problem	Pressure perturbation calorimetic studies of the solvation properties and the thermal unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease
Result	As a consequence, the α values in the denatured state are rather small.
Conclusion	At higher temperature, the decreased solvation effect can no longer offset the larger thermal volume of the unfolded state compared to the unfolded state, and the ΔV changes sign.
Background	These pressure studies demonstrated that the absolute value of the volume change upon unfolding was strongly temperature dependent, decreasing significantly in magnitude with increasing temperature.
Background	Hofmeister anions interact favourably with the peptide groups whereas they interact unfavourably with the nonpolar peptide side chains.
Result	From the figure it can be clearly seen that there is a continuous increase in α, |(dα/dT)10–40|, and Tm values with increasing glycerol concentration.
Background	On the contrary, apolar, hydrophobic amino acid side groups act in the reverse manner, as structure makers, by enhancing the space consuming hydrogen-bonded network structure of water, particularly at low temperature.
Method	Recombinant Snase with the sequence of nuclease A from the V8 strain of Staphylococcus aureus was obtained using the λ expression system in the Escherichia coli strain Arλ9 as described by Shortle and Lin.38
Background	The structure-making and structure-breaking tendencies of these compounds on protein-bound water have been studied extensively by Lin et al.17
Background	In contrast, when denaturating co-solvents bind to proteins, water–protein and water–co-solvent interactions, that occur in the unbound state, are replaced by relatively stronger co-solvent–protein interactions in the bound state with concomitant release of water molecules into the bulk phase.
Result	Upon unfolding, the volume decreases by about 19 mL × mol−1.
Conclusion	The solvent contribution to the apparent coefficient of thermal expansion of the protein, α, is enhanced considerably when the protein is immersed in a solvent known to be more structured than H2O (even the more structured D2O has a drastic effect) and nearly eliminated in a solvent in which “normal” water is largely absent (e.g., in 1.5 M urea).
Result	In agreement with the DSC data, the transition has been found to be reversible up to temperatures of 80 °C.
Result	A stabilising effect, even though there is a reduction in solvation around the protein (|Δα/ΔT10–40| is ca.
Method	We have chosen to study the solvation properties and stability of a well characterized monomeric protein, staphylococcal nuclease (Snase), in H2O and D2O buffer solutions, as well as in the presence of various types of co-solvents, such as glycerol, sorbitol, urea and potassium sulfate.
Method	For both compression and decompression experiments, temperature, pressure, and heat flow are recorded as a function of time.
Background	Thus overall, while the thermal expansivity of the unfolded state is likely to be higher than that of the folded state (at least near the transition temperature), its temperature dependence is probably reduced in comparison.
Conclusion	The possibility of extensive glycerol binding to the protein, even at high glycerol concentration, might be ruled out because in such a case part of the water should be expelled from the protein surface to accommodate glycerol which would lead to a decrease in α and hence |(dα/dT)10–40|.
Method	The relative volume change upon unfolding, ΔV/V, as obtained from the area under the transitional peak, is calculated by integrating the α(T) transition curve (after baseline subtraction); ΔV/V = −1.5 × 10−3.
Method	Sample concentration of Snase in 10 mM phosphate buffer was 0.2 wt% with a known quantity of co-solvent.
Background	This layering is probably substantial at low temperature, and thermal activation leads to a continuous release of this “condensed” water from the protein surface.
Method	The cell volume is 0.51 mL.
Problem	Several reports state that stabilisation of proteins in the presence of sorbitol, which is about twice as large as glycerol, is also mainly due to it being excluded from the surface of the protein,47,51i.e., in their presence, proteins are preferentially hydrated.
Result	We observed that there is a continuous decrease in Δα which finally approaches zero with increasing urea concentration.
Result	Concerning Tm values, similar results as from PPC were obtained from the DSC traces of Snase in D2O and H2O, respectively.
Result	The protein begins to unfold (onset temperature) at ca.
Background	Upon denaturation, the surface of the protein increases, which results in an enhanced preferential hydration of the denatured protein relative to the native protein.51,52
Background	Very interesting observations are made when the protein is stabilised in the presence of the salt K2SO4.
Conclusion	In this case, surprisingly, ΔV is found to be positive which is an indication of the formation of a swollen, molten globule kind of unfolded state at the transition.
Background	The pressure effect on the sample volume is negligibly small (0.02%).
Conclusion	The observed reduction in absolute value of ΔV in the presence of these stabilisers may be in part attributed to the formation of a partially unfolded state of the protein (which is consistent with a smaller change in heat capacity upon unfolding) and in part directly due to the temperature dependence of ΔV; as Tm increases, ΔV decreases (in absolute value).
Background	Studies involving the application of hydrostatic pressure to solutions of native proteins have demonstrated that at temperatures below that corresponding to the unfolding transition, the volume change upon unfolding of proteins is negative, i.e. the partial specific volume of the unfolded state is smaller than that of the folded state and therefore pressure induces unfolding.64,65
Result	This would be in agreement with the smaller ΔCp values as obtained by DSC (Table 1).
Method	The calorimeter is then automatically heated or cooled to the next desired temperature and the next two pressure jumps are applied.
Result	The α values at low temperature are much smaller than those of the pure Snase–H2O system, and the absolute value of dα/dT, taken between 10 °C and the onset temperature of the denaturation peak, also decreases with increasing urea concentration (Fig. 6a).
Method	1.8 bar to the cells in order to avoid air bubbles at elevated temperatures.
Conclusion	25% greater than that of the system Snase–H2O (ΔH ≈ 178 kJ mol−1), which is, again, an indication that the protein is more stable in D2O. Such an enhancement of the structure of a solvation layer contributing to the protein stability was also reported elsewhere43,44.
Background	Once the water is released, it no longer contributes to the partial volume of the protein and hence to α.
Method	Each pressure jump starts with equilibration at 5 bar pressure of the calorimeter in the isothermal high gain and low noise modes at the desired temperature with 0.02 °C tolerance.
Result	ΔH values are 168 and 108 kJ mol−1 for the 0.5 and 1.5 M urea containing solutions, i.e., they decreased by ca.
Problem	Hence, in general, for proteins in dilute aqueous solutions, the temperature dependent thermal expansion coefficient at the protein–solvent interface is dominated by protein–water interactions, which arise mainly from interactions between the protein groups with the surrounding hydration layer.
Result	12% increase in solvation of the native protein in the sorbitol containing solvent, which also acts as a more effective stabilising agent.
Result	The larger absolute (dα/dT)10–40 value in the case of Snase–D2O points to a higher solvation than that of the Snase–H2O system.
Background	At higher temperatures, between 55 and 65 °C, our earlier studies show that the increase in specific volume with temperature was nearly linear, i.e. the thermal expansivity appeared nearly constant over this temperature range.
Result	The value of ΔV at the transition temperature of 51.5 °C obtained in this study (−19 mL mol−1) is smaller than those reported in denaturation studies by pressure36 or acid induced33 denaturation.
Background	However, in pressure unfolding experiments on Snase at 21 °C as a function of increasing osmolyte concentration (in that case xylose up to ca.
Background	Since the solvation effects of a protein are dominated by hydrophilic groups, both the native and unfolded protein exhibit a net structure-breaking profile for α(T).
Result	100% for the 3.5 M glycerol solution), which might be due to a less disordered unfolded state.
Method	Baseline subtraction (pure buffer) and normalization with respect to protein concentration were performed by the instrument software, yielding the temperature-dependent apparent molar heat capacity of the protein, Cp.
Background	The X-ray diffraction pattern of native crystalline Snase32 reveals that in the crystalline state the protein contains 26.2% helices, 24.8% β-sheets (barrel), 7.4% extended chains, 24.8% turns and loops, and 8.7% unordered chains, and the remaining 8.1% is uncertain.
Method	Various pH variation studies from 2 to 9 on Snase using DSC indicated that it is most stable at pH 5.5 in 10 mM phosphate buffer.
Conclusion	D2O has a stronger structuring tendency which, in contact with structure-breaking protein groups results in a relatively larger solvation layer around the protein surface.
Background	Glycerol, being a strongly hydrophilic co-solvent, interacts strongly with H2O and has a weaker affinity for the polar residues on the protein surface, thus leading to preferential hydration of the protein.
Result	However, one can assume that at 52.5 °C it would have decreased to at least −25 mL mol−1, a value within experimental error of that determined in the present studies.
Background	This is in accord with our SAXS measurements of the radius of gyration, Rg, of Snase in solution; within the accuracy of our data (±1–2 Å), the Rgvalue is unchanged up to ca.
Result	Similarly to D2O, a continuous increase in solvation was observed with increase in glycerol or sorbitol content in the buffer, hence indicating that they act as protein stabilisers, as is indeed verified by the increasing Tm and ΔH values.
Method	The apparent expansion coefficient of the protein is measured, which includes changes in hydrational properties at the protein surface with regard to the pure solvent system.
Result	100% increase in solvation, assuming that (dα/dT)10–40 is proportional to the degree of solvation.
Result	From Fig. 3b it is clear that there is a shift in Tm from 51.7 °C in H2O to 56.3 °C in D2O. We observe also a considerable increase in the enthalpy of unfolding in D2O. The transition enthalpy change of the system Snase–D2O (ΔH ≈ 227 kJ mol−1) is ca.
Background	Sulfate, for example, is known to be a good protein stabilizer, because sulfate strongly salts out nonpolar compounds and only weakly interacts with and thus salts in the peptide group.55
Method	32 wt%).
Background	All experimental data are again listed in Table 1.
Result	The temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of these groups is very small.
Problem	27 wt%) sorbitol as co-solvents in 10 mM phosphate buffer.
Result	Above a concentration of 2.5 M urea, no clear transition can be observed anymore.
Method	The chemicals were used without further purification.
Background	The mechanism of stabilisation by anions is due to a reduction of the net positive charge on the protein through anion binding.
Conclusion	The observed thermodynamic data obtained drastically depend on the interfacial solvent conditions, which drastically influence the structural and dynamic behaviour of the biomolecular system.
Result	The comparison of (dα/dT)10–40 values of Snase–1.5 M sorbitol (−1.7 × 10−5 K−2) and Snase–1.5 M glycerol (−1.5 × 10−5 K−2) indicates that there is an ca.
Background	D2O has a stronger structuring tendency which, in contact with structure-breaking protein groups results in a relatively larger solvation layer around the protein surface.15
Background	It has an extraordinarily high fraction of ionisable groups.
Background	Stabilisation of proteins due to the presence of such salts are thus more effective at lower pH than at neutral pH.55
Result	In the unfolded state at ca.
Method	The heat peak of compressed and decompressed pressures should agree in absolute values; they are of opposite sign, however.
Background	Hence, in their presence proteins are preferentially hydrated.18,45–51
Result	The Δα and ΔCp values for Snase in phosphate buffer solution at pH 5.5 are 0.12 × 10−3 K−1 and 5.7 kJ mol−1 K−1, respectively.
Background	The excess area available after protein denaturation would be occupied by the remaining free urea molecules, such that electrostatic or hydrophobic hydration effects could be largely reduced.
Result	From this figure it is clear that in the lower temperature region, the negative slope of α(T) is considerably enhanced in D2O: (dα/dT)10–40 = −2.2 × 10−5 K−2 in Snase–D2O, whereas (dα/dT)10–40 = −1.17 × 10−5 K−2 for Snase in dilute buffer prepared from H2O. The larger absolute (dα/dT)10–40 value in the case of Snase–D2O points to a higher degree of solvation than in the Snase–H2O system.17
Method	The cells were grown according to the procedure described by Shortle et al39. except that SB rather than MOPS media was employed.
Method	The software then initiates a pressure release to ambient pressure.
Background	Intrinsic protein volume, including the effects of protonation and deprotonation of amino acids upon unfolding, volume changes due to thermal motions and changes in water structure at the protein surface are the three major factors contributing to the apparent thermal expansivity of a protein.42,56
Conclusion	However, it is altogether possible that the combination of both temperature and urea significantly destabilizes residual interactions in the unfolded state compared to either perturbation alone.
Background	This could arise from significant binding of urea to the protein in the pre- and post-transitional temperature range.
Problem	The interpretation of the present results must be made in the context of previously published work on the volumetric properties of Snase (and proteins in general) as a function of temperature and pressure.
Result	Fig. 2a represents PPC curves of the apparent expansion coefficient, α(T), of 0.4 wt% Snase dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.5, from which α at different temperatures, the midpoint of thermal unfolding (Tm) and the relative volume change upon unfolding, ΔV/V, are obtained.
Result	The PPC and DSC results for Snase dissolved in 0.5 M K2SO4 buffer solution are presented in Figs. 7a and 7b, respectively.
Problem	Furthermore, the steric exclusion principle should make the distance of closest approach of a co-solvent with a larger molecular volume greater than that of water.
Conclusion	The state might be characterized by a swollen, molten globule kind of state.
Problem	Finally, ΔV values for the temperature-induced unfolding are compared with corresponding data for the pressure-induced unfolding of Snase.
Problem	It is well known that the destabilising nature of the chaotropic agent urea on protein stability is caused by binding efficiently to the unfolded state of the protein, compared to the folded state, due to exposure of more binding sites upon unfolding.52,53
Method	The pressure perturbation (PPC) experiments were performed in the DSC calorimeter using the MicroCal PPC accessory.
Background	Moreover, the radius of gyration observed for urea denatured Snase (35 Å)70,71 is smaller than that which we observed by temperature denaturation (45 Å),34 indicating that, on the contrary, urea leads to a more ordered unfolded state than does temperature.
Conclusion	Pressure perturbation calorimetry has been found to be an effective tool for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient and volume changes of biomolecular systems with very high precision.
Result	The Tm value shifts from 51.5 °C in H2O to 56 °C in D2O. Furthermore, there is a ca.
Result	The high ΔH value of ca.
Background	Volume and expansivity changes of Snase upon pressure and acid induced denaturation were given elsewhere33–37 and are compared with these data.
Conclusion	The increase in ΔV and the decrease in ΔH with increasing urea concentration support these conclusions, although a significant contribution to the increase in ΔV arises as well from its temperature dependence; as Tm decreases ΔV increases in absolute value.
Method	The instrument was operated in the high gain mode at a rate of 40 °C h−1 for all experiments.
Result	Given that the specific volume of the unfolded state is smaller at low temperature than that of the folded state, the temperature evolution of the specific volume of the two states may be similar to that schematized in Fig. 8.
Result	In the present case, even though there is a net reduction in solvation, similar to urea, the K2SO4–buffer system increases the stability of the protein.
Method	After complete equilibration, automatically checked by an adjustable slope criterion, an upward pressure jump is applied when the PPC controller reconnects the PPC cells with nitrogen gas.
Result	The value of (dα/dT)10–40 = −0.77 × 10−5 K−2 obtained for the K2SO4 system is ca.
Result	Surprisingly, in this and only in this case, ΔV becomes positive (ΔV = 19 mL mol−1).
Result	At approximately 51.7 °C, where the DSC curve Cp(T) exhibits its maximum, a distinct dip is observed.
Background	More to the point, the pressure-induced unfolding was carried out over a temperature range of 4 to 45 °C, below the unfolding transition temperature.34
Result	The estimation, based on the present PPC results, of the change in α upon unfolding, Δα, at the transition temperature yields a positive value of about 1 × 10−4 K−1, and is in the range (0.5–1.5 × 10−4 K−1) of the values obtained by Lin et al17. on a number of proteins.
Result	The volume change upon unfolding is much smaller, −5 mL mol−1 in 1.5 M sorbitol as compared to −16 mL mol−1 in 1.5 M glycerol and −19 mL mol−1 in the pure phosphate buffer system.
Conclusion	The decrease in thermal expansivity with temperature is indeed largely controlled by the net structure-breaking tendencies of the polar protein groups interacting with water.
Background	Thus, as temperature is lowered this ordering significantly reduces the expansivity.
Background	Firstly, as shown in the seminal paper by Lin et al.,17 hydrophobic groups known to act as structure-makers in water have a large positive slope and a negative curvature in α(T) plots, while structure-breaking hydrophilic groups show the opposite behaviour.
Conclusion	This would be in agreement with the reduced ΔV values observed.
Background	Thus, clearly the value and sign of the volume change upon unfolding at higher temperature will depend upon how the thermal expansivities of folded and unfolded states change with temperature.
Conclusion	This preferential binding of urea to the protein reduces the hydration level causing the protein to approach a disordered, random coil-like state at high urea concentration.
Problem	Taken together, these data lead to a deeper understanding of the solvation process of proteins in different co-solvents in their native and unfolded states.
Method	Both buffer and protein solutions were degassed before being injected into the respective cells.
Conclusion	This state can be achieved only, if K2SO4–H2O interactions dominate over Snase–K2SO4–H2O interactions and specific anion binding is largely missing.
Result	The high ΔH (ca.
Background	The in depth knowledge of various thermodynamical properties of proteins in solution has been drawing attention of many researchers, as these form the basis for understanding their physiological functions, but also their use in drug design and formulations.
Conclusion	These results for the various chaotropic and cosmotropic co-solvents clearly show that the co-solvent not only markedly changes the stability of Snase, but also its solvation, and perhaps also the structures of the denatured state.
Conclusion	For the Snase in glycerol, the changes in expansivity and heat capacity upon unfolding indicate a decrease compared to those measured in pure buffer, indicating a compaction of the unfolded state as the glycerol concentration increases.
Conclusion	The Δα and ΔCp values are less affected by changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic hydration, which is attributed to the strong ligand binding of urea with the protein.
Background	Aromatic groups as well are exposed to the solvent in the unfolded state, whereas they are significantly less exposed in the folded state.
Background	The stability of globular proteins depends on temperature,1–4 solvent properties,5–8 and its hydration capacity.9,10
Result	A stabilising effect, even though there is a reduction in solvation around the protein is observed for 0.5 M K2SO4 as co-solvent.
Background	The volume change that accompanies the unfolding transition of a protein (in this case Snase) clearly will depend upon the temperature at which the transition occurs.
Problem	To quantify the relative hydration changes, PPC experiments were also conducted using 0.5 M (ca.
Method	Applying this method, determination of the thermal expansion coefficient and relative volume changes, ΔV/V, upon unfolding of proteins in solution has advantages over densimetric measurements since its sensitivity is higher by more than one order of magnitude.17,29–31
Method	The thermal unfolding of Snase was measured by means of a high precision VP DSC micro-calorimeter from MicroCal, Northamption, MA, USA.
Background	This is accompanied by a decrease in solvent density around the hydrophobic groups.
Method	Their influence on the expansivity as well as the denaturation temperature, relative volume and enthalpy changes upon unfolding were obtained with high accuracy.
Result	80 °C, α is similar to that of the pure buffer system, again.
Background	These effects are related to specific binding of urea to the polypeptide, thereby replacing water molecules and releasing them into the bulk phase, such that the hydration of the protein is largely diminished in the presence of urea, prior to denaturation.
Result	As the temperature is lowered, it is likely that α of the unfolded state increases, but probably to a lesser degree than that of the folded state.
Conclusion	One explanation for this discrepancy between previous studies and the present can be found in the temperature dependence of the volume change, which is quite large.
Method	4 mg mL−1.
Result	Above 70 °C, α then decreases again.
Background	0.5 M), we observed that while the apparent free energy of unfolding increased with increasing xylose concentration as would be expected, the volume change of unfolding remained essentially constant.68
Background	Furthermore, these compounds tend to reduce the solvent ordering (structure breakers).
Result	All the results are listed in Table 1.
Method	In PPC, the apparent coefficient of thermal expansion of the protein is deduced from the heat consumed or produced after small isothermal pressure jumps, which strongly depends on the interaction of the protein with the solvent at the protein–solvent interface.
Result	Fig. 3a shows PPC results of Snase in dilute buffer prepared from D2O (Snase – D2O) in comparison to those of Snase in H2O (Snase – H2O).
Conclusion	Since the volume change of unfolding decreases strongly with increasing temperature, we can conclude that at least part of the observed effect of glycerol on the ΔV is due to the increase in temperature.
Method	Accurate information related to solvent binding, ligand binding and volume changes during unfolding and denaturation of proteins can be obtained by this technique.
Method	Integration of eqn. (1), at constant temperature, over a small pressure range, Δp, gives the working equation for calculating α The coefficient of thermal expansion, α, can thus be determined from an isothermal measurement of the heat consumed or released upon small pressure changes.
Conclusion	Firstly, ΔV being positive is probably an indication of the dominance of the thermal volume expansion due to an increase in the dynamics of backbone and side chains of the protein over the internal dead volume being exposed during denaturation.
Result	The increase in ΔV and the decrease in ΔH with increasing urea concentration support these conclusions.
Conclusion	Upon unfolding of the Snase, the internal dead volume becomes accessible to water (leading to a decrease in system volume) and the dynamics of the protein backbone, and amino acid side chains increases thus leading to an increase of the thermal volume.
Background	Thermodynamically, this thus also manifests itself as preferential hydration.
Result	43 °C and the temperature of the unfolding midpoint, Tm, was found to be 51.5 °C.
Method	Here, ΔQrev is the heat difference between the sample cell that contains the dissolved sample, and the reference cell, which contains the same solvent, upon the pressure changes Δp.
Conclusion	Indeed, the negative values for Δα and ΔCp in presence of this salt point to no marked increase in SASA upon unfolding.
Background	This high sensitivity is a prerequisite for such studies, as the expansivity and the volume change upon unfolding, which can be either positive of negative, are usually very small (ΔV/V < 0.3%).
Background	Snase is a small protein of about 17.5 kDa containing 149 amino acid residues and no disulfide bonds.
Conclusion	More generally, the present results on Snase combined with the few previously reported studies on other small globular proteins17 demonstrate that the PPC technique provides an exquisitely sensitive handle on the hydration properties of proteins in solution, the understanding of which is prerequisite to a global comprehension of protein stability and dynamics.
Background	Vicinal water molecules may be oriented to the surface charges leading to a more or less layered structure.17,62,63
Result	30% lower compared to the pure buffer system) is also observed for 0.5 M K2SO4 as co-solvent.
Background	Their results indicate that when hydrophilic groups, such as charged or polar side chains of proteins, are exposed or come in contact with the surrounding water, they show a pattern characteristic of structure breakers, with a large positive apparent expansion coefficient of the protein, in particular at low temperature, which decreases drastically with increasing temperature.
Method	In extending eqn. (2) to protein solute (in buffer solvent) and solvent (buffer only) binary component systems, we obtain eqn. (4): where α and αsolv are the thermal expansion coefficients of the protein and solvent, respectively, and Vcell is the active cell volume.17,26
Method	The protein concentration used for the PPC studies was ca.
Result	Similar results were obtained for the Snase–D2O system (data not shown).

Method	The detection principle is based on the quenching phenomenon known as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).

Method	For example, Kimbal and co-workers applied Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) in a polycarbonate micro-device.191
Background	This issue is even more exacerbated by the wide variety of possible substrate material (see Table 1) in conjunction with the vast range of biological matter used as analyte; consequently various surface treatments have been investigated.
Background	Noteworthy is that even though silanisation has been successfully applied to microfluidic devices, criticisms regarding the reproducibility of such coatings have been argued.60
Background	The majority of developments in miniaturisation have stemmed from institutes with strong analytical, engineering, fabrication and optical specialisations.
Method	During the first step—called denaturation—the hydrogen bonding stabilising the double stranded DNA template is broken to form two complementary single strands (see Fig. 1).
Background	Such an amplification process produces tree-like molecules leading to amplified molecules of different lengths.
Background	Importantly however, the devices should also innately incorporate the requirements of each bioassay to enable them to be customised to the exact requirements of the specific bioassay and thus permit the optimum co-selection of device and choice of assay chemistry.
Background	These attractive features explain why the miniaturisation of the PCR apparatus has been of a growing interest in the scientific community.
Method	For example, Denoual et al. presented a microfluidic device in which cells could be directed to cell traps by the fluid flow.71
Method	The loop portion is complementary to part of the target sequence, whereas the stem portion flanks the loop and are self complementary and unable to hybridise to any of the target sequence.
Background	Such a procedure limits the formation of non-specific products, as it impairs the enzyme activity until thermocycling temperatures are reached.
Method	Although the number of cycles could easily be adjusted (by changing the number of revolutions) the manufacturing process required additional and complex steps.
Method	This technique is based on MSDA but instead of using a set of two specific primers, or random hexamers, it involves 3 sets of specific primers.
Method	Based on the background fluorescence signal, a certain level of fluorescence signal (usually around 10 times the value of the average background fluorescence value during early cycles) is imposed as the threshold limit.
Method	These probes are indeed highly specific, rendering the detection of viruses with substantial genetic variation among strains, such as the HIV virus, impractical.
Method	MGBs are used in conjunction with fluorogenic probe technologies and are gaining in popularity with the increasing requirement to place probes over exact regions of target sequences, such as exon-exon boundaries used in splicosomic studies.
Method	Buch et al. combined standard gel electrophoresis to TGGE in their 2-D separation device.192
Method	The use of micro-arrays96,98,99 and drop-metering100 provided these micro-devices with high throughput (more than 10,000 parallel reactions have been reported101–104) and better fluid-handling capabilities, whereas thermocycling conditions, such as temperature uniformity105 and heat transfer optimisation,106 were closely studied.

Background	In this study, a recombinant Taq polymerase-thioredoxin displayed an increase in processivity when compared to the wild-type Taq polymerase (from 50–80 nt to >300 nt).
Conclusion	It is consequently essential to optimise the PCR parameters in order to obtain the most favourable conditions and enhance the PCR yield.
Method	This method, called Rolling-Circle Amplification (RCA), produces a single-stranded product initialised by only one primer.
Method	One of the most widely used processes to prevent on-chip adsorption of molecules consists of silanisation, a method first introduced by Hjertén in .198558
Method	Finally Chiou et al. presented a bi-directional sample pumping system.119,120
Background	Although MSDA can be applied with specific primers, it has also been used with random hexamers, leading to the amplification of entire genomes.22
Method	A spatially resolved map of specific sequence locations on the DNA can then be generated, leading to a ‘genetic barcode’ for each individual molecules.
Method	Similar MGB technology is now used both by Applied Biosystems for their TaqMan® chemistry and by Epoch Biosciences for their MGB Eclipse Probe Systems.
Method	Both devices consisted of a silicon chip with a micro-well in which the sample was loaded (see Fig. 2).
Background	Since its introduction, this model has been replicated by numerous groups, sometimes with major amendments.
Background	There have only been few devices based on a well approach that differed significantly from the original design presented by Northrup.
Background	Other groups have favoured more targeted approaches to isolate DNA from its medium.
Method	On the other hand, Bienvenue et al. implemented a sol-gel technique to extract DNA.34
Method	The innovative component is the DNAzyme, a catalytically active oligonucleotide capable of cleaving nucleic acid substrates at specific locations.
Method	The selectivity of real-time PCR was greatly improved with the introduction of fluorogenic probes (oligonucleotides whose sequences are complementary to part of the target molecules),164 such as the TaqMan® or hydrolysis probes.
Method	Electrophoresis has also been used to increase sample concentration, where Halle et al. introduced a micro-fluidic free-flow zone electrophoresis device to concentrate biological particles in buffer75.
Method	Although regularly achieved by heating the cell,54,76,77 other lysis methods have been developed.

Method	A Monte Carlo Lattice model was proposed by Mercier and co-workers to discribe solid phase amplification.19
Background	It is therefore of paramount importance to be able to differentiate cells or targets of interest from other biological material.
Method	For example, Washizu and co-workers used electrostatic fields for direct DNA manipulations84 and Mohanty et al. applied dielectrophoresis and electrical impedance spectroscopy for single cell manipulation within microfluidic systems.85
Method	A similar experiment was performed in a capillary by Park et al.117
Method	Roche Molecular Diagnostics have also developed a mutation analysis kit based on hybridisation probes.
Background	Interestingly, at the end of the 1st cycle, the product obtained is defined only at one end, as the replication is a function of time at the extension temperature.
Method	Two heaters sandwiched the Rayleigh-Bénard cell and were maintained at constant temperatures, namely 97 °C at the bottom and 61 °C at the top.
Background	A few approaches have also been developed on macro-scale apparatus and could also be of interest for microfluidic PCR.
Background	It is the authors' belief that, although real-time probes are not yet widely used for on-chip detection due to complex detection system requirements, they will soon be routinely implemented for on-chip quantitative and qualitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR).
Method	The Ligase Chain reaction was initially introduced by Landefren et al. in 1988 and is based on the ability of two oligonucleotides to hybridise next to each other given an appropriate complementary DNA target molecule.26
Method	Although this technique might seem limited as it only applies to circular templates with an appropriate promoter, a wider variety of applications are technically possible as circular templates include viruses and plasmids.
Background	Since its introduction PCR sustains a tremendous impact in several fields, including clinical diagnostics, medical sciences and forensics.
Method	Finally, Yoon and co-workers examined the influence of pH, potential and electrode polarity in an electrowetting–based microdevice in order to prevent bio-molecule adsorption148.

Background	This device has since been developed further.35,111
Background	Priming methods comparing poly(A) tails and random hexamers for cDNA synthesis were studied by Resuehr and co-workers,15 while Halford et al. studied the effect of primer-dimer formation over the PCR yield.16
Method	The most widely used procedure of analysis is the threshold method.187
Method	The temperature is then lowered for the annealing step: primers (synthetic sequences of single stranded DNA—normally 17–25 nucleotides long—which flank the target region to be amplified) specifically bind to the complementary sequences of the DNA template.
Method	The latest developments in DNA diagnostic technologies include the expansion of the DNA alphabet.
Method	A high-throughput device capable of genotyping simultaneously 384 samples in less than 325s was presented by Emrich et al.161
Background	In this instance, heat labile antibodies neutralise the enzyme activity until they are denaturated during the initial PCR denaturation step.
Background	A Scorpion primer consists of a three-part molecule based on the following model: (PCR primer) – (blocker molecule) – (probe).
Method	Analysis in less than one minute and femtomolar range sensitivity are claimed to be achieved.
Background	However, they still do not take full advantage of lithographic techniques.
Background	Protocols to optimise PCR reactions are nowadays readily available.17,18
Background	In addition, because the temperature of the entire chip needs to be altered for thermocycling, they display unnecessary inertia.
Method	Although real-time PCR methods using hydrolysis probes, conformation probes or hybridisation probes are powerful techniques, they are inherently limited in some cases, as pointed out by Gardner and co-workers regarding TaqMan® probes.185
Method	Additionally, a common advantage of miniaturised systems over macro apparatus is their reduced thermal mass: as they present less inertia to temperature changes ramping rates for heating or cooling are drastically increased, and this gives rise to more rapid gene amplification, and may present benefit for some of the conformation fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes used in real-time PCR.
Method	A detection method similar to the CPB and also based on a hybridisation probe was recently released by BD Biosciences: the BD Qzyme™ Assay.173
Method	Popular intercalating dyes include ethidium bromide and SYBR® Green, but other intercalators have also been studied such as BEBO,149 YOYO150 and TO-PRO-.3151
Method	Most striking has been the synonymous advent of real-time PCR and delivery of a robust quantitative gene measuring tool.

Method	Operating on a comparable FRET principle as TaqMan® probes, Molecular Beacons were introduced by Tyagi and co-workers.179,165,180
Method	Consequently, the polymerase had to be replenished after each cycle which was arduous, but importantly increased the risks of contamination during PCR as the sample vial had to be re-opened, and made optimisation almost impossible to achieve.
Method	For example, Li and co-workers developed a system that could perform cell counting, cell-lysis, PCR, on-column hybridisation and product detection.200
Method	However, the post-genome era brings with it new problems and exposes old fissures that have undermined the application of PCR.
Method	One approach to continuous flow-through based amplification was introduced in 1994 by Nakano and co-workers when they used capillary-based systems.
Background	Cui and co-workers investigated the effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes on the PCR yield.147
Method	At this stage, the temperature is primer-dependant and usually varies between 50 °C and 65 °C.
Method	Remarkably, specifically amplified products were detected after 20 cycles in 1.5 minutes.
Conclusion	This might be due to an increased simplicity in sample handling for the former method.
Method	In addition, valves, mixers and pumps were incorporated onto the chip.
Method	A few products using this technique are commercially available, such as GenomiPhi™ DNA amplification offered by Amersham Biosciences, and REPLI-g™ from Molecular Staging.
Method	Capillary electrophoresis was also used by Park et al. to demonstrate the capture and subsequent release of DNA fragments within PEEK tubing.50
Method	Different approaches have been implemented on chip, where for example, Lin et al. introduced an in-vitro impedance measurement of cells to distinguish between abnormal cells and normal cells under different frequency domains.67
Background	Indeed, when considered alongside the potential to dissect the PCR process itself to understand more how to increase and maintain PCR efficiency, the miniaturisation of PCR and future PCR applications seem to become permanently entwined.
Background	Tissues are heterogeneous, in that many types of different cells co-exist within biological samples.
Background	At the same time as the above techniques enabled quantitative PCR, the issue relating to data analysis became a paramount concern.
Method	Although these three steps are performed at three different temperatures, it is not uncommon to combine the annealing and the extension into one operation.
Background	A high versatility in terms of thermocycling conditions was shown by Kajiyama and co-workers when they presented independently-addressable wells.107
Method	DNA amplification in a water-in-oil emulsion, presented by Nakano et al.,137 could be pushed to further limits thanks to the better fluid handling provided by micro-devices.
Background	Not only could system features easily be integrated to ease complex sample handling and tracking, but also possible risks of contamination would be reduced.
Background	A theoretical evaluation of a system based on this concept was provided by Bu and co-workers.133
Method	A sample-shunting device using ferrofluidics for actuators has also been introduced by Hardt et al.134
Background	Whilst several of the more successful and reproducible applications of PCR are manifested in qualitative analyses, increasingly the requirements of PCR testing are placing a burden on elucidating a robust means to accurate and precise gene quantitation.89
Method	Lettieri and co-workers have also introduced a microfluidic device for performing controlled micro re-circulating flow capable of DNA trapping.72
Method	Although this method was introduced as a single-base-modification detection method, it has since been used for the sole purpose of DNA replication.27
Background	Fuchs and co-workers have used DEP to trap individual particles among a few thousand cells suspended in a liquid on a microelectronic chip.68
Method	The scaling-up of pre-existing procedures for higher throughput would be inappropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and population studies.
Background	To circumvent this issue, several methods have been investigated, and for instance, different strategies were implemented to prevent protein adsorption in PDMS microfluidic devices.
Method	However, most PCR experimental testing to date does not clearly relate the gene content measured to the contribution made by all specific cell types.
Background	The reader is also directed to other reviews covering either a wide range of applications,1,2 or specific fields such as DNA and protein analysis,3 genomics and proteomics analysis4 or molecular diagnostics5.
Method	This detection method is based on a chimeric DNA-RNA-DNA probe labelled at one end with a reporter and at the other end with a quencher.169
Conclusion	As the amount of DNA generated is directly dependent on the number of primers immobilised at the surface, SPA would highly benefit from on-chip applications where area-to-volume ratios are greatly enhanced.
Method	Integrated heaters provided the temperature zones necessary for thermocycling.
Problem	Miniaturised nucleic acid analysis
Result	Other structures have also been investigated, and for a more detailed overview of some of the most recent, the reader should refer to Table 2.
Method	Finally, Sundararjan and co-workers demonstrated immobilisation and programmable release of single DNA molecules by electrical heating86.
Background	This is for example the case of PfuUltra™ Hotstart DNA polymerase, which is commercialised by Stratagene.
Method	As FRET is impaired, the reporter's emission can be detected.
Background	The influx of interdisciplinary interest offers distinct and critical benefits to the application driven life sciences.
Background	Disciplines both directly and indirectly related to the life sciences can readily exploit PCR, and with various genome study initiatives increasingly making available sequence data, this trend is set to continue into the future.
Method	Additional dynamic coatings have also been studied by Giordano et al. and include hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), epoxy (poly)dimethylacrylamide (EPDMA), and diaminobutane (DAB).146
Method	However, indiscriminate binding is also a major drawback: both specific and non-specific products will generate the same type of signal, making it difficult to differentiate between them.
Method	In addition, since cells can be manipulated in a microfluidic environment (see section ‘Sample Preparation’), another application could be in situ (meaning inside a cell) DNA amplification.
Method	FRET corresponds to the transfer of energy from a fluorescent reporter molecule (R) to a quencher molecule (Q), leading to light emission by Q at a longer wavelength than the donor.
Method	The GENE-CODE system is a real-time nucleic acid detection system based on the reduction in fluorescent signal during PCR.
Background	Since 1985, different parameters for the PCR have been extensively studied to optimise the reaction and maximise amplification yield throughout a number of constraints imposed by different bioassays.
Problem	Therefore, to allow researchers from engineering and life science backgrounds to reflect on the recent progress and to help traverse interdisciplinary boundaries, we have compiled a concise review of papers based around nucleic acid assay miniaturisation and microfluidic PCR, and set these against a framework of biological applications.
Method	Notomi et al. developed another method for DNA amplification: Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification (LAMP).23

Background	This device was later modified by Wheeler and co-workers.114
Method	The denaturation-annealing-extension cycle is repeated, typically between 25 and 40 times.
Method	Upon denaturation, the extended-DNA-strand/target hybrid is dissociated and so are the two arms of the Scorpion.
Background	As the development of microfluidic devices continues, newly devised microstructures need to utilise the better production and micro-engineering procedures.

Method	It consisted of a serpentine channel that passed through three heating zones maintained at constant temperature by copper blocks (see Fig. 3).
Background	A dynamic, moving-sample system particularly addresses previously described issues relating to full process integration.
Method	Based on a comparable concept, Curcio and co-workers performed a high-throughput DNA analysis system in a Teflon tube by separating different sample plugs with immiscible organic plugs.116
Background	Firstly, the value p is positively linked to the PCR yield.
Method	Although the continuous-flow approach allows for fast heating and cooling rates (thus improving product specificity) parallelisation is not easily applicable as it would significantly complicate the design and most likely increase the footprint of the PCR chip.
Method	However, one probe is labeled at the 3′ end with fluorescein (the “donor” probe), whereas the two other probes are labeled with an acceptor dye on the 5′ end (either LC-Red 640 or LC-Red 705, each dye corresponding to a mutation possibility).
Background	However, even though the merits of PCR are widely recognised, the process of DNA amplification impairs the speed, the cost-effectiveness and even sometimes the accuracy and the sensitivity of such detection methods.
Method	It is also well documented that PCR is highly prone to contamination due to its efficiency and high sensitivity.87,88
Background	Biological samples are most often present as a complex matrix.
Method	For example, Oda et al. addressed the invasive characteristics of heating elements conventionally used by replacing the heaters with a transparent contact-free heating technique based on infra-red wavelengths.110
Method	Such characteristics were proved to stabilise DNA hybridisation, resulting in shorter primers retaining higher melting temperatures177 and increased probe specificity.178
Background	Similarly, during a study of blood components and their inhibitory effects on PCR, Wolff and co-workers captured cells on electrodes by DEP while inhibitors were eluted by washing.69
Method	Alternatively, Tan and co-workers recreated a tissue-like structure in a micro-fluidic environment using cell-matrix assemblies and biopolymers,64 while Schaak et al. have performed cell culture in droplets.65
Background	DNA hybridisation is widely exploited to achieve high selectivity and sensitivity.
Method	The introduction of a thermostable enzyme obviated this cumbersome procedure and also enabled the automation of the process.
Background	Alternatively, Shin and co-workers coated PDMS micro-channels with parylene in order to prevent adsorption on the chip surface.62
Background	Several examples of on-chip integrated systems have also been published in the literature.
Background	Other sequence-independent detection methods have also been investigated.
Background	Indeed several operations (such as sample preparation, PCR and DNA detection) could ultimately be integrated into one device.
Background	The efficiency of biological reactions is often limited by interactions between the microchannel surfaces and the bio-molecules present in solution.
Problem	We also introduce some applications that have as yet to be explored in a miniaturised environment, but should benefit from improvements in analytical efficiency and functionality when transferred to planar-chip formats.
Method	For example, Single Strand Displacement Amplification (SSDA) is an isothermal technique first introduced by Walker et al. in .199221
Background	Other enzymes such as Pfu,11 KlenTaq,12Vent13 or Tfi14 have been applied to PCR.
Method	With this technique, the DNA molecules are effectively labelled with an intercalator dye and subsequently separated according to their sizes.
Background	For example, El-Ali et al. performed a gas phase silanisation of a SU-8 chamber surface in order to enhance its PCR compatibility.44
Method	This temperature is often close to 72 °C, which is related to the temperature optimum of the DNA polymerase in conjunction with retaining hybridisation specificity of primers.
Background	RCA has been coupled to other techniques such as MSDA,24 or RCA itself (Circle-to-Circle Amplification).25
Background	A microfluidic approach to DNA amplification would present several advantages.
Background	Significantly, some enzymes are nowadays modified to block their activity until they are heat activated.
Background	Secondly, for large values of p, the distribution of the DNA population becomes multinodal, presenting multiple probability peaks.
Method	In 2003, Krishnan et al. presented an original device relying on convection to provide thermocycling conditions.113
Background	Once cell lysis has been performed, the issue of DNA extraction can be addressed.
Background	Indeed the generated strands are not cleaved from the strand molecule from which the amplification originated.
Method	EraGen Biosciences, Inc. developed the AEGIS (An Extended Genetic Information System) platform that extends the DNA alphabet by up to 8 new bases.
Method	With this method, CT values can be compared and DNA template concentrations can be calculated.
Background	For a more detailed overview of some of the materials used, the reader should refer to references in Table 1.
Background	Different approaches have been applied on chip.
Background	Applications of such barcodes include genetic comparison of samples or populations, SNP detection and genome mapping or microorganisms.
Background	Based on this theory, the number of molecules generated by a PCR reaction starting with a single molecule after n cycles is: (1 + p)n, where p is the probability for a molecule to duplicate.
Method	Increasingly the need to analyse from the single cell is gaining in popularity, and once again the packaging and process offered by integrated miniaturised PCR offers great promise.
Method	Since the introduction of the DNAzyme probes, several applications have been reported in the literature such as quantitation of nucleic acid sequences in real-time,174 study of the probe fluorescence signal175 and elaboration of a circular probe176.
Background	Such an equation leads to two consequences.
Method	This method has been implemented on chip with success in Professor Harrisson's group170–172.
Background	In addition, a variety of applications were successfully demonstrated, such as ligase chain reaction108 and isothermal nucleic acids amplification (NASBA).109
Method	Lizardi and co-workers used circularisable oligonucleotide priming to investigate amplification of circular DNA templates.24
Method	Miniaturisation of PCR integrated bioassays potentially possesses all of the desired qualities and comes with additional benefits relating to sample tracking, contamination, and savings in finances and time.
Method	Due to cost-effectiveness, the use of intercalators (molecules that upon binding to double-stranded DNA exhibit significant enhancements in their fluorescence quantum efficiencies) in combination with gel electrophoresis is probably the most widely used method in biological laboratories for the detection of post-PCR products.
Method	During the PCR process, the primer hybridises to the target molecule and is then extended.
Method	The use of intercalators to detect DNA molecules presents two main advantages: it enables real-time detection152,153 and it is highly versatile, as the dyes have been selected to bind selectively to dsDNA.
Background	In this section the reader will find a brief overview of some of the commercially available real-time probes.
Background	Ensuing Taq polymerase engineering succeeded in enhancing processivity (which is defined for polymerases as the number of nucleotides added per unit to a strand during one sequence of binding and dissociation from the primer template) and fidelity (capability of a polymerase to faithfully replicate a DNA strand without expansion or deletion in the number of base pairs, nor substitution of the bases (AT ↔ CG)).10
Method	Upon hybridisation with the target sequence, the enzyme RNaseH specifically cleaves the RNA region of the probe, resulting in fluorescence emission.
Method	This in-vitro enzyme-mediated method facilitates the generation of nucleic acid sequences based on the choice of specific primers.
Method	MGB are flat molecules that can fit in the minor groove and interact with the phosphate-sugar backbone either by hydrogen bonds or by hydrophobic interactions.
Method	Long ignored issues relating to the meaningfulness of data are starting to be questioned.
Method	Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequent non-random base substitutions, present at 1 per 1000 base pairs within the genome, and are avidly studied for association with diseases.
Method	To this extent, different techniques have been implemented on chip, such as dielectrophoresis (DEP).
Method	Once the temperature reduced for the annealing/extension phase, the probe-part of the Scorpion anneals to the extended strand, the quenching process is impaired and fluorescence is detected.
Method	Finally the temperature is raised to allow extension: the template is typically replicated by a thermostable DNA polymerase.
Background	Although this problem can be sometimes traced to inhibitory materials used during micro-device fabrication (e.g., residual chromium from chrome masks in glass chip fabrication142 or thermocouples110), the most predominant problem is the elevated adsorption of the PCR components onto the chip surface due to the increase of the surface-to-volume ratio in a micrometer-scale environment.
Background	However this technique presents several drawbacks.
Method	The sample was continuously pumped through the capillary unidirectionally and DNA amplification occurred as the sample was going through each temperature cycle.
Method	Efforts to develop matrices for on-chip CE with lower viscosity comprised a novel sieving buffer based on hydroxypropylmethylcellulose presented by Han et al.,159 as well as a study of a series of poly(ethylene oxide) matrices by Xu and co-workers.160
Background	On the contrary, during the annealing step, the loop part hybridises to the target molecule to separate the reporter and quencher dyes and a signal can be detected.
Method	Sequence-specific probes are first hybridised to the DNA molecule.
Method	Each capillary was coated with a transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) layer, ensuring that thermal cycling conditions could be independently controlled.
Method	Device improvements have included optimisation of the PCR conditions to prevent any cross-contamination during injection series,122 modification of the design to combine RNA Reverse-Transcription and PCR123 as well as a sensitivity study.124
Method	Molecular Beacons have been used in a microfluidic environment to detect the breast cancer gene BRCA1 by Culha and co-workers,181 and also as a mean to study DNA hybridisation kinetics and to perform DNA melting temperature analysis by Dodge et al.182
Background	Although surface coating strategies such as silanisation are possible solutions (see section ‘Surface treatment’), their effectiveness is sometimes questionable due to a lack of reproducibility.60
Background	The well-approach PCR41,44,54,76,208–217 seems to be favored for integrated systems when compared to the continuous-flow process.35,123,125,206,218–220
Method	Based on a similar concept, Nazarenko and co-workers introduced self-quenched primers.183
Method	Alternatively, DirectLinear™ Analysis enables the sequencing of single linear genomic DNA molecules.
Method	For example, high-speed PCR could be achieved on chip by using a microwave-assisted technique first demonstrated by Fermér et al.136
Method	To resolve this issue, U.S.
Method	For example, the costs associated with each reaction are still quite high (mostly due to the price of the enzyme), even if current parallel processing has attenuated costs.
Method	In addition, an integrated on-capillary arrangement capable of cell-lysis, reverse transcription PCR and product analysis was reported by Matsunaga et al.,77 while a set-up capable of PCR, sequencing and purification in capillaries was introduced by Hashimoto et al.201
Background	After having detected the cell of interest, the next step is usually some form of isolation and concentration.
Method	A different approach was introduced by McKendry et al.:199 using cantilever assays they were able to determine the sequences of unlabeled DNA molecules present at nanomolar concentrations.
Method	For example, Grodrian et al. applied the principle of segmented flow on chip for parallel cell culture by separating culture media plugs with immiscible fluid.63
Method	They enclosed the PCR sample inside a capillary, the ends of which were blocked by rubber pads.
Background	This is due to the amplification during the initial cycle becoming critical and a failure for the original molecule to replicate having a lasting impact.
Method	Ito et al. favoured Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (ACE) to develop a gene mutation assay.194
Background	By rendering the system quasi-autonomous, interactions with the sample would be minimised and the number of possible sources of contamination would be greatly lessened.
Method	After hybridisation (and during annealing) the probe is cleaved due to the 5′ nuclease activity of the enzyme.
Background	Although DEP and electrophoresis are widely used techniques for cell trapping, other methods have also been investigated.
Method	Upon extension the probe is displaced and recovers its quenched conformation with a resultant drop in the fluorescence signal.
Method	The extraction of a thermostable enzyme, Taq, from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus was the first breakthrough.7–9
Method	An optical system stopped the pumping mechanism when the sample reached the desired temperature zone.
Background	Much attention has focussed on the transfer of cell culturing techniques to planar chip formats.
Method	An alternative to conventional DEP has been proposed by Lapizco-Encinas et al. and involved electrodeless DEP for cell trapping.70
Method	In this paper the chips were mounted onto a ferrous ring, while the inductor was made of a copper wired wound around a ferrite core.
Method	It is often called the threshold value, or CT value, and represents the number of cycles necessary to generate an exact amount of DNA.
Method	This technology is still fairly new but clinical diagnostics assays based on the AEGIS bases isoC and isoG are already commercially available (such as the VERSANT HIV Assay developed by Bayer Diagnostics).
Method	As the sample moved up and down in the cell, PCR conditions were provided and DNA was amplified.
Method	They then induced Eddy currents in the ferrous ring, which generated localised heat without any physical contact.
Method	After plotting the fluorescence signal obtained during PCR against the number of cycles performed, the intersection of this curve with the threshold limit can be determined.
Method	The merging of PCR with gene micro-array applications has been demonstrated by Solid Phase DNA Amplification (SPA).28,29
Background	The PCR is a three-step amplification process first introduced by Saiki and co-workers in .19856
Method	From another perspective, Pollack and co-workers used an electrowetting process to control droplets containing PCR reagents and demonstrated that such fluid handling did not inhibit DNA amplification.135
Background	The future of high throughput gene analysis will benefit greatly from the implementation of micro Total Analysis Systems, particularly for the analyses requiring multi-step procedures such as those including sample preparation.
Background	A second approach, called dynamic passivation, includes passivating reagents directly in the PCR mixture.
Method	Comparably to PCR, this method allows exponential amplification of double-stranded DNA.
Method	The detection principle is based on FRET: the single-base-mutation is detected depending on the wavelength at which the signal is detected, as LC-Red 640 and LC-Red 705 emit at two different wavelengths.
Background	Microfluidic devices will serve therefore to provide a level of standardisation not presently achievable with current laboratory standard operating procedures, especially those based upon minute quantities of samples.
Method	The first on-chip PCR devices were presented by Northrup and co-workers in 199390 and Wilding et al. in .199491
Method	This technique, first introduced in 1990 by Haase et al.,138 has since been optimised139 and has been combined to reverse transcription140 and to LAMP amplification,141 offering enhanced flexibility in terms of possible applications.
Method	In addition, this type of device is restrictive in terms of number of cycles: the number of meanders is decided during the design procedure and cannot be modified to increase the number of cycles once the chip is manufactured.
Method	The application of PCR to define specific sequences for subsequent use as micro-array probes has also recently been described by Greiner et al30.
Method	In this device, the capillary was rested on three heating blocks and the sample was pumped back and forth to provide thermal cycling.
Method	Trau and co-workers applied PCR reactors combined to microarrays to genotype Chinese medicine plants.198
Background	For example, Erill and co-workers pinpointed that the component the most prone to adsorption was the Taq polymerase enzyme.143
Method	The most common additives are polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)144 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)144 or proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA).143
Method	For example, Rutledge and co-workers studied the mathematics of quantitative PCR and offered an alternative analysis tool based on DNA mass at threshold limit,188 whereas Liu et al. favoured the kinetic curves to extrapolate the initial amount of gene transcript.189
Method	Prior to this discovery, the enzyme was heat labile and lost its activity after each denaturation step.
Background	The application of micro total analysis systems has grown exponentially over the past few years, particularly diversifying in disciplines related to bioassays.
Method	The DNAzyme operates in coordination with a DNAzyme-specific fluorogenic target that is cleaved during the PCR process, and consequently the fluorescent signal enables the real-time monitoring of DNA amplification.
Method	Different approaches have been used to simulate the temperature distribution in continuous-flow PCR chips, such as finite element analysis,127 CFD-ACE+ (computational fluid dynamics and multi-physics software)128,129 and Lattice Boltzmann simulations.130
Method	By alternating the current going through the inductor, magnetic fields were produced.
Method	New algorithms have also been developed to promote automatic analysis of real-time PCR data190.
Background	Although an emphasis has been placed on papers published since 2002, pertinent articles preceding this publication year have also been included.
Background	Also heat inertia is reduced to a minimum because only the sample thermal mass needs to be taken into consideration rather than the chip plus sample as in the case of microwell PCR, with a direct consequence of enhanced rates of heating and cooling.
Background	Not only were systematic errors in fluorescence measurements investigated,186 but different methods of analysis were also introduced.
Method	In order to provide the energy necessary to break the bonding, this step is commonly performed at temperatures between 94 °C and 96 °C.
Background	An additional approach was introduced when Kirby et al. studied the effect of polarity and surface charge on cell adsorption by controllably modifying the zeta potential at the surface of their device39.
Background	Indeed, when attempted this approach reveals the necessary requirement to integrate gene analysis into a process that serves best to eliminate both sampling and experimental error.
Method	Interestingly, Robinson et al. studied the influence of the molecular weight of PVP over the coating efficiency, as well as the effect of analytes in solution over BSA adsorption.145
Background	The physical elements the most integrated are heaters41,44,125,205,206,209–214,216–219 and valves.41,54,76,82,202,206,209,210,212,216–218
Method	For example, Reddy and co-workers presented an organic-aqueous liquid extraction on a micro-device in order to purify DNA obtained directly from cells.83
Method	Several techniques to detect SNPs have been implemented on chip.
Method	Using DirectMolecular™ Analysis, quantitation, SNP analysis and molecule interaction quantification can be performed by colour coincidence counting.
Background	The following section addresses recent studies in the areas of cell culturing, cell identification and cell trapping, cell lysis and DNA extraction within microfluidic formats.
Background	Biological matter is comprised from the unit of life, the cell, and gene analysis is portrayed in terms of gene abundance, presence, or absence, within a particular biological sample.
Method	They consist of single-stranded oligonucleotides arranged in a stem-loop structure, with a reporter probe attached to one of the stem arms and a quencher to the other.
Method	For example, Lai and co-workers developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on a compact disk platform,56 while Cai et al. determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that DNA hybridisation is strongly frequency-dependent.197
Background	Whilst quantitative PCR assays present a significant challenge for microfluidic applications, the development of qualitative assays such as the analysis of genetic mutations has attracted much attention.
Background	One of the main challenges in miniaturisation is the integration of functional components to perform several operations without the need for macro apparatus or manual user input.
Background	Although this method is well accepted among the scientific community, new approaches have been proposed.
Method	This approach, based on shunting the sample back and forth over heating zones in a straight channel by applying alternate pressure, combines the cycling flexibility of the well-chips with the quick temperature transition of the continuous-flow PCR micro-structure (see Fig. 4).
Problem	The primary focus of this review is to detail recent new approaches to sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection within microfluidic devices or at the microscale level.
Method	Friedman and co-workers proposed a static sample approach to nucleic acid amplification in .1998118
Background	PCR has also been studied from a more theoretical approach and statistical models describing the reaction are often based on the branching theory.19
Method	These include integration of electrophoretic product sizing on a monolithic device,92 as well as optimisation of conditions to provide faster PCR (under 7 minutes),93 single-molecule detection,94 real-time applications95 and multiplexing.96,97
Background	Although PCR is the most popular DNA amplification technique, other methods also exist20 and are potentially suitable for microfluidic-based devices.
Method	These single-fluorophore labelled primers emit fluorescence with different intensities depending on their conformation: a weak emission is noticed when the primers are in a stem-loop configuration, whereas the fluorescence signal is at its maximum when the primers are incorporated in a double-stranded DNA helix.
Method	In order to extract the different nucleic acid analytes from within a cell, controlled lysis is usually performed.
Method	One of the most widely used on-chip detection techniques for DNA molecules is capillary electrophoresis (CE).
Method	Pal and co-workers performed PCR using induction heating, another non-contact heating method.112
Background	The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has succeeded in revolutionising the analysis of nucleic acids.
Method	The length of capillary in each bath determined the duration of the annealing, extension and denaturation steps.
Background	The studies described in this review were published in commonly available journals as well as in the proceedings of three major conferences relevant to microfluidics (Micro Total Analysis Systems, Transducers and The Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show).
Problem	A few groups have started to tackle this issue and a brief overview of the integrated systems available at the moment is given in this section.
Method	However, Liu et al. circumvented this drawback by manufacturing a rotary device,131 where a12nL-sample was introduced in the chip and subsequently pumped at a rate to enable 2–3 revolutions per minute.
Background	When they are in a loop-stem structure, the fluorescence signal is quenched by FRET or proximity effects.
Method	Therefore the cumbersome processes that endure sample losses and sample degradation, ultimately compromise gene quantitation can be circumvented by employing closed μTAS.
Background	To simplify, Molecular Meacons exist in two different states.
Method	Genomics has developed a unique method with which single molecules from an un-amplified sample can be detected using the GeneEngine™.
Background	In the case of continuous-flow chips for example, transition times to change temperature depends only on the sample pumping rate and the time the sample needs to reach temperature equilibrium.
Method	Scorpion primers are an alternative to Molecular Beacons.184
Method	In the first dimension, molecules were separated by gel electrophoresis according to their sizes, while TGGE allowed a SNP analysis in subsequent perpendicular channels.
Background	Choi et al. favoured a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(acrylic),61 while Xiao and co-workers used a polyacrylamide gel.49
Method	During the amplification process, a site-specific quencher is inserted opposite a complementary AEGIS base in one of the primers, resulting in signal diminution by FRET phenomenon.
Method	For example, strong ultrasonic fields were applied by Tachibana et al.,78 whereas Marmottant and co-workers presented an experiment during which gentle bubble oscillations were successfully applied to rupture lipid membranes.79
Background	Although the linear replication process is negligible in terms of amounts of DNA produced, it is a crucial intermediary step in PCR as it is through linear replication that a specific amplicon is obtained, thus rendering exponential amplification possible.
Background	Results showed that the nanotubes increased the amount of DNA amplified when they were introduced in concentrations below 3 µg/µL.
Background	Although microfluidic devices were originally structured in silicon or glass, polymers such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and Polycarbonate (PC) have increasingly been used as alternative substrate materials.
Method	The strand is then stretched and the probes are detected linearly by the GeneEngine™.
Method	Zangmeister and co-workers developed a novel fluorescence detection method based on the displacement of a fluorescent-tagged oligomer by the untagged target molecule163.
Method	Integrating a size separation method or denaturing gradient profile often assists the identification of authentic amplicons.
Method	From another perspective Goubault et al. captured rare cells using magnetic filaments and adjusted the specific/non-specific discrimination ratio by optimising flow rates,73 while Lu and co-workers presented a rapid organelle separation by free flow isoelectric focusing.74
Background	In this method, the primers are surface-bound and thus do not freely diffuse in solution.
Method	Alternatively, Emmelkamp and co-workers chose an optical detection technique for sorting cells based on their intrinsic fluorescence signal within a microfluidic structure.36
Background	DNA amplification is mostly performed to increase the detection sensitivity either of a specific molecule among a heterogeneous population or to characterise and/or measure a given section of a target.
Method	Due to the difference in temperature, a convection flow developed in the cell, with an upward flux in the centre and downward fluxes on the sides.
Background	It is only at the end of the 2nd cycle that the specific product is first produced.
Method	Another system offering various capabilities—namely cell capture, cell lysis, purification and DNA amplification—was introduced by El-Ali and co-workers.44
Method	RQ-PCR optimisation using TaqMan® probes has been performed and include the study of the best possible combinations between commonly used fluorophores and quenchers by Marras et al.,165 as well as quantitative co-amplification of multiple targets (multiplexing) by Wang and co-workers.166
Background	As can be seen in this table, the pre-PCR steps that are integrated the most include cell capture,44,54,76,82,202–205 cell lysis44,54,76,82,202–204,206,207 and sample purification.35,44,54,76,82,203,205,208
Background	It is to be noted that these devices are fairly flexible in terms of design: the well geometry can be tailored to a specific application, or arrays of wells are easily manufactured.
Method	The entire chip was heated and cooled to provide the adequate thermocycling conditions.
Background	A number of instances of integrated on-capillary systems have been recently presented in the literature.
Background	As with ligase chain detection, the probes are specifically designed to target the amplicon at adjacent sites.
Background	Two of the new bases, isoC and isoG, have already been combined to the natural DNA bases to produce the company's diagnostic technology.
Method	To assess the viability of the cultured cells Goto and co-workers implemented a protocol to detect nitric oxide released by macrophages66.
Background	Another interesting point is that two types of replication occur at the same time: semi-specific products such as those from cycle 1 lead to linear replication, whereas truly specific products or amplicons that are defined at both ends lead to exponential replication.
Method	Two flows (an electroosmotic flow and a pressure-driven flow) were opposed and molecules were trapped by adjusting the different velocities.
Method	Magnetic beads were also used in microfluidics devices to immobilise by hybridisation alternatively the target template,54 the capture probe42 or various sensing agents.48

Conclusion	Again, this discrepancy, at least partially, might be caused by spin–vibronic interaction between the singlet and triplet states.
Method	Consequently, to get accurate valence-only estimates higher-order electron correlation contributions have to be determined in this case, as well.
Result	The resulting value is 7045 ± 60 cm−1 (20.13 ± 0.17 kcal mol−1).
Conclusion	Another possibility would be to record the absorption spectrum, e.g., by the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique.
Result	The final estimates for the triplet–singlet energy gap, T0(ã), are 2170 ± 40/2171 ± 40 cm−1 for HCCl/DCCl and 7045 ± 60 cm−1 for CCl2.
Background	Considering the most dependable results67,68 among these calculations the computational estimate of ΔETS is 6.4 ± 0.8 kcal mol−1.
Result	Although for CH2 and HCCl we found that the post-CCSD(T) electron-correlation contributions are small, and their CBS values can be estimated relatively accurately using small basis sets, it is desirable to check in an independent way whether the same holds for CCl2.
Background	The highest-level calculation so far was performed by Demaison et al79 using the Weizmann 2 (W2) model chemistry.84,85
Conclusion	It is worthwhile checking if the available dispersed fluorescence spectrum above 7000 cm−1 (see Fig. 1) is consistent or inconsistent with the computed T0(ã) and the ã state vibrational levels of CCl2.
Method	Beyond the apparent accuracy of the FPA method its other advantage is that the uncertainty of its final energy predictions can be estimated reliably due to the systematic build-up of its composite calculations.
Background	A year later Andrews24 performed a similar experiment and assigned the lower of these frequencies to the symmetric stretch (ν1).
Method	Second, the variational method, unlike the second-order expansion of the anharmonic oscillator model, treats exactly the resonances between the vibrational levels belonging to the same electronic state.
Method	The one-particle basis sets chosen for the frozen-core correlation calculations include the correlation-consistent (aug)-cc-pVXZ, X = 2(D), 3(T), 4(Q), 5, and 6, basis sets developed by Dunning and co-workers.116,117
Method	The PES for the variational calculations was built using force constants in the quartic (SPF, SPF, bend) representation, where the non-zero forces were not neglected in the expansion of the potential.
Background	Although these calculations were carried out at a relatively low level of electronic structure theory, the singlet and triplet states were treated in a balanced manner, i.e. Hartree–Fock theory was used for the triplet and the generalized valence bond (GVB 1/2) method for the singlet.
Background	They have estimated the magnitude of these perturbations by the difference between the experimentally determined vibrational levels and the vibrational levels calculated from fitted effective spectroscopic parameters, when only the unperturbed levels were included in the preceding fit.
Result	Together with this the contribution of their cross term, namely the difference between the correlated and non-correlated one-electron scalar relativistic effects, is also increasing.
Background	Moreover their chemistry is particularly fascinating because their lowest singlet and triplet states are expected to be closely spaced in energy but have quite different chemistries.1–5
Method	This was then augmented by the difference of the DKH(2) and the MVD1 results calculated also at the ROHF level.
Result	The vibrational levels obtained by substituting these parameters into the anharmonic oscillator equation of a triatomic molecule,are given in Tables .11–16142
Background	In 1999 Lineberger et al have published a report on the photoelectron spectrum of CCl2−.42
Method	The use of the quartic force field in SPF coordinates was chosen because according to previous results133,134 (i) employing an SPF representation instead of the simple stretch representation results in better agreement between the variationally computed and the experimental energy levels; and (ii) the quartic and sextic force fields in SPF coordinates result in highly similar energy levels.
Result	From our calculations the errors of the Var4+ results for the X̃(0,n2,0) energy levels of HCCl (Table 11) are {+5, −2, +8, +11} cm−1 for n2={1,2,3,4}.
Background	The analysis of these spectra resulted in effective rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, nuclear quadrupole interaction constants, and spin-rotation constants for these species.
Background	Similarly to HCCl, the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl2 was first estimated reliably ab initio by Bauschlicher et al56 Including this work the theoretical predictions between 1977 and 1999 started to converge to around 19–23 kcal mol−1 as follows: 13.5 kcal mol−1 (1977),56 19.1 kcal mol−1 (1979),70 21.9 kcal mol−1 (1985),71 {21.1, 23.2, 21.6 ± 1.4, 25.9} kcal mol−1 (1987),58,59 20.5 kcal mol−1 (1990),60 23.7 kcal mol−1 (1991),72 20.0 kcal mol−1 (1992),61 23.7 kcal mol−1 (1992),73 20.5 ± 1 kcal mol−1 (1993),62 19.7 kcal mol−1 (1996),63 21.0 kcal mol−1 (1999),74 and {23.1, 19.6} kcal mol−1 (1999).65
Result	The root-mean-square (rms) errors calculated from the first eight and 12 vibrational levels of HCCl and DCCl are 3.6 and 4.5 cm−1, respectively.
Method	Utilizing the high-quality ab initio results described above, the enthalpies of formation of HCCl(X̃1A′) and CCl2(X̃1A1) at 0 K have been determined by calculating the enthalpy change of the reactionsCH2(ã1A1) + HCl(X̃1Σ+) → HCCl(X̃1A′) + H2(X̃1Σg)andCH2(ã1A1) + 2HCl(X̃1Σ+) → CCl2(X̃1A1) + 2 H2(X̃1Σg)
Result	It was found in many cases that the convergence with the correlation level is significantly different in the two cases.
Background	In ref. 17 Chang et al discussed the spin–vibronic coupling and the perturbation between certain vibrational levels of the X̃ and ã states.
Result	Our error estimate for the ZPE correction is ±5 cm−1.
Background	Nonetheless as the brief discussion below shows, there are still major discrepancies and unanswered questions.
Method	The electronic structure calculations reported in this paper have been performed with the help of the ACES II,93,94 PSI 2,95 Gaussian03,96 and MRCC97,98 program packages.
Conclusion	This estimate is in good agreement with other recent ab initio predictions, but the assigned error bar of the theoretical prediction is reduced by an order of magnitude.
Conclusion	Another problem making the above assignment ambiguous is related to spin–vibronic coupling.
Conclusion	In a similar way, considering the error series of the calculated X̃(0,n2,1) vibrational levels ({0, +3, −4, +4} for n2 = 0,1,2,3), a smaller, roughly +4 cm−1 energy increase would be obtained for the X̃(0,2,1) vibrational level at 3181 cm−1 (experimental, Table 11) due to the interaction with the ã(0,1,0) and/or the ã(0,0,1) vibrational levels at 3050 cm−1 and 3110 cm−1 (experimental T0(ã) + Var4+ vibrational level), respectively.
Conclusion	An alternative explanation is offered if a relatively large spin–vibronic perturbation existed between the singlet and triplet states, and it is different for the two species.
Result	As it is expected, no perturbation due to spin–vibronic interaction with the triplet state can be found up to 4000 cm−1, since the calculated triplet–singlet energy gap is well above this energy region.
Result	The best technically feasible values for the triplet–singlet energy gap and the enthalpies of formation of the HCCl and CCl2 radicals have been determined through the focal-point approach.
Result	Utilizing the calculated thermal correction, ΔfH298° − ΔfH0° = 0.07 kcal mol−1, of ref. 77. results in 76.35 ± 0.20 kcal mol−1 for ΔfH298° of HCCl(X̃1A′).
Result	This reveals that in spite of the large deviation, 1688 cm−1, observed at the HF level, the two CBS CCSD(T) values agree within 24 cm−1.
Conclusion	On the other hand, if the coupling is large, the triplet state vibrational levels computed using the triplet-state PES only could be significantly different from their experimental counterparts.
Method	In the case of CCl2 the computations have been repeated using an unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) reference, as well.
Result	Comparing the Var4 energy levels up to 4000 cm−1 to the experimental data of Liu et al43 results in an rms error of 2.6 cm−1, which is even less than the assigned uncertainty, ±3 cm−1, of the experimental data.
Result	Nevertheless, the δCCSDTQ increment is comfortably small, +47 cm−1.
Result	For these two vibrational levels of DCCl the calculated data and the experimental values agree to within 6–15 cm−1.
Problem	After the detailed description of the methodologies applied (Section II), we report in Section III the theoretical determination of the triplet–singlet energy gap [T0 (ã)] of HCCl and CCl2 by employing the focal-point approach (FPA).86,87
Result	The VPT2 vibrational parameters of the X̃ and ã states of HC35Cl, DC35Cl, and C35Cl2 are listed in Table 10.
Background	All the theoretical results47,65,77–79,82,83 favor the higher value and predict ΔfH298° between 51 and 56 kcal mol−1.
Result	Moreover, we give reasonable estimates of the expected errors in these calculations.
Background	Therefore, it is not described here in detail.
Background	In 1977 Huie et al29 recorded the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) excitation spectrum of the Ã1B1 ← X̃1A1 transition of CCl2 in the gas phase.
Conclusion	Since peak A is slightly out of the error bar of the computed T0(ã), peak B becomes the most probable candidate for the ã(0,0,0) energy level.
Background	The first direct spectroscopic observation of HCCl/DCCl in the gas phase was reported in 1966 by Merer and Travis,6 who have assigned the band system between 550 and 820 nm to the Ã1A″ ← X̃1A′ transition.
Method	Quartic (and partial sextic) force fields in (stretch, stretch, bend) internal coordinates have been determined by finite differentiation of frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ energy values.
Background	The paper is concluded by a short summary detailing the possible impact of the new theoretical data on subsequent experiments.
Background	There are no experimental data available on the vibrational energy levels of triplet HCCl, and only two vibrationally excited energy levels in the ã state of DCCl were observed experimentally.17
Conclusion	We believe that our calculations are sufficiently precise to guide in a detailed fashion experimental planning and ultimately to aid the acceptance or rejection of various experimental interpretations of the measured spectra.
Background	Two microwave studies39,40 on C35Cl2 provided not only accurate rotational constants but also centrifugal distortion constants, elements of the complete nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor, and nuclear spin-rotation constants.
Background	This was followed by several other gas-phase laser30–36,44 and synchrotron37,38 fluorescence excitation studies.
Background	McKee and Michl assumed,81 and supported it with calculations, that the “mystery” band corresponds to the quartet state of CCl2−.
Background	In this work they have determined the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl2 to be 3 ± 3 kcal mol−1.
Method	The advantages of this procedure over calculating the appropriate atomization energies lies in that (i) the contribution of the spin–orbit effect can be neglected since it is much smaller for a non-linear open-shell species than for an atom; and (ii) the errors due to neglecting higher-order correlation effects (e.g. δCCSDTQP) is expected to cancel out in a proper reaction scheme.
Problem	Accurate ab initio determination of spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of mono- and dichlorocarbenes
Background	The Ã1B1 ← X̃1A1 excitation energies have also been obtained, T0=17 092 cm−1 in Ar, first from matrix isolation experiments.23,25–28
Conclusion	Since this contribution is relatively small and the δCCSD(T) contribution converges relatively fast with the basis set size to CBS limit, it is expected that post-CCSD(T) electron correlation contributions are well estimated by CCSDT and CCSDTQ calculations even using small basis sets.
Result	Convergence of the valence-only energy difference of the singlet and triplet states of CCl2 with the correlation level is similarly slow (see Table 7) as observed for CH2 and HCCl.
Problem	This paper will focus upon the study of the singlet/triplet gap of mono- and dichlorocarbene, HCCl and CCl2, respectively, by state-of-the-art quantum chemistry techniques.
Method	The variational calculations were performed with the program DOPI3,133 where DOPI stands for DVR (D)—Hamiltonian in orthogonal (O) coordinates—direct product (P) basis—iterative (I) sparse Lanczos eigensolver.
Result	This perturbation lowers the energy of ã(0,0,0), in other words the unperturbed T0(ã) of HCCl is larger than the experimentally observed value.
Result	From considerations analogues to those given in Section V.1. the uncertainty of this value is ±0.20 kcal mol−1.
Background	Among these probably the most notable are the first rotationally resolved jet-cooled studies of Clouthier and Karolczak,34,35 which yielded structural and vibrational parameters of the two lowest-lying singlet states.
Background	There has been a history of both experimental6–55 and theoretical56–83 studies of chlorocarbenes.
Conclusion	From this we expect that the contribution of the post-CCSD(T) electron correlation is on the order of a few tens of cm−1.
Problem	Indeed we aim to approach “near-spectroscopic” accuracy, i.e., ±∼50 cm−1 for ΔETS.
Conclusion	From the data presented the following conclusions, similar to those found for CH2,138 can be drawn: (i) Both the extension of the one-particle basis set and the electron correlation treatment systematically lowers the energy of the singlet state with respect to the triplet state.
Method	Finally, the electron correlation contribution to the one-electron scalar terms were obtained as the difference of the ROHF and CCSD(T) MVD1 results.
Conclusion	(ii) The HF triplet–singlet energy splitting is fairly independent of the size of the one-particle basis set, it changes only 276 cm−1 between the aug-cc-pVDZ and the CBS limit.
Result	The calculated vibrational levels of triplet C35Cl2 are summarized in Table 15.
Result	Practically we were able to carry out CCSDT calculations only with the aug-cc-pVDZ and the ‘old’ (i.e. one less d orbital on Cl) cc-pVTZ basis set, while CCSDTQ calculations were limited to the ‘old’ cc-pVDZ basis set of Dunning.
Conclusion	Above 3000 cm−1 the situation is, however, quite different.
Method	Although the variationally obtained vibrational levels have somewhat larger errors than the levels obtained by the use of the fitted expansion, determination of the perturbations from the variational results has certain advantages.
Result	In contrast to this, the ZPE contribution of the total T0(ã) value, +75 ± 5 cm−1 (see Table 6), of CCl2 is in between the corresponding values obtained for CH2 and HCCl/DCCl.
Background	Later they revised this number to 4.2 ± 2.5 kcal mol−1.22
Background	Therefore a precise determination of the singlet/triplet gap, ΔETS, is important for understanding reaction mechanisms.
Result	Inclusion of core correlation (Tables 3 and 8) and relativistic effects (Tables 4 and 9) are becoming more and more important as one goes from the lighter to the heavier species.
Result	The final estimates for the triplet–singlet energy gap, T0(ã), are 2170 ± 40 cm−1 for HCCl and 7045 ± 60 cm−1 for CCl2, favoring the singlet states in both cases.
Conclusion	This result further supports the alternative reassignments76,81 of the photodetachment spectrum of CCl2− over the original assignment42.
Method	All-electron correlation calculations have been carried out using the (aug)-cc-pCVXZ sets,120,121 which are able to describe the core region adequately.
Conclusion	Nevertheless, this seems to be a consequence of fortuitous cancellation of errors in this region, since the errors of the perturbationally obtained vibrational energy levels of modes with low bending excitation have opposite signs.
Background	Ideas have been put forward to reinterpret the “mystery state”75 of the photoelectron spectrum.
Method	Since the geometry optimizations and the force field calculations have been performed at different levels of theory, the force fields included non-zero forces.
Conclusion	The present result is in excellent agreement with the recent W2 computation of Demaison et al79 Furthermore, due to the inclusion of higher-order correlation effects in its computation in this study and utilization of a reaction scheme instead of atomization energies it was possible to reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions by a factor of two.
Conclusion	A possible source of this apparent discrepancy is the assigned error bar of the experimental observations, which is comparable to the difference of the two T0(ã) values.
Conclusion	The uncertainty of the present result is smaller by a factor of five than the uncertainty of the former highest-level calculation,77 and more than an order of magnitude smaller than the values obtained by experiments45–47 or reported in the available thermochemical databases143–146.
Result	The valence-only FPA results for the triplet–singlet energy splitting of HCCl are summarized in Table 2.
Background	Besides the rotationally resolved X̃(0,0,1) ← (0,0,0) transition,19 pure rotational transitions of the X̃(0,0,0) vibrational level have also been observed recently for H35CCl and H37CCl.20
Background	For this reason, the determination of these energy gaps has attracted intense interest from quantum chemists and experimentalists alike.
Conclusion	In this case the high-energy X̃ state vibrational overtones (n2 > 20 or n1 > 10) are not expected to appear in the spectrum, while the intensity of the triplet state levels is determined by the spin–vibronic coupling.
Background	Some of these studies, especially the earlier ones, resulted in values below 50 kcal mol−1: 47 ± 3 kcal mol−1 (1967),48 44 ± 2 kcal mol−1 (1976),50 47.8 ± 2 kcal mol−1 (1978),52 37 ± 7 kcal mol−1 (1980),53 39 ± 3 kcal mol−1 (1985).45
Method	The zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) corrections have been computed both by the VPT2 and the variational methods (see Table 6).
Method	No virtual molecular orbitals were kept frozen in any of the calculations.
Background	A few years later the same group has re-recorded these spectra and assigned 19/24 vibrational levels of HCCl/DCCl in the X̃ state.17
Background	All the available quantum chemical calculations47,65,77,82 are consistent with these results, scattering between 75.3 and 77.4 kcal mol−1.
Method	If not noted otherwise, the improved version118 of these basis sets have been employed for Cl, which include more d-functions than the original version.119
Conclusion	Consequently, we allocate an 50 cm−1 error bar to the 7050 cm−1 valence-only result of the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl2.
Result	The enthalpies of formation of HCCl (X̃1A′) and CCl2(X̃1A1), at 0 K, are 76.28 ± 0.20 and 54.54 ± 0.20 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Background	Lee et al76 suggested that it could be an excited state of the anion or that the discrepancy could come from the errors fitting the Franck–Condon factors.
Background	After this work the ab initio prediction of the triplet–singlet gap of HCCl has evolved in the following way: 5.4 kcal mol−1 (1986),57 {5.8, 6.7, 5.6 ± 0.7, 9.3} kcal mol−1 (1987),58,59 {6.0, 6.4 ± 0.7} kcal mol−1 (1990),60 6.39 kcal mol−1 (1992),61 4.8 kcal mol−1 (1993),62 5.8 kcal mol−1 (1996),63 6.2 kcal mol−1 (1997),64 {9.0, 5.7} kcal mol−1 (1999),65 {0.9–6.6} kcal mol−1 (2000),66 {6.1, 6.6} kcal mol−1 (2000),67 {6.1, 6.8, 5.9} kcal mol−1 (2001).68
Background	The first data on the X̃ state vibrational levels of HCCl, more specifically the ν2 (HCCl bend) and the ν3 (CCl stretch) fundamentals were provided by matrix isolation infrared (IR) studies.7,18
Conclusion	Hence, it would be advisable to utilize other experiments to determine T0(ã) of CCl2.
Conclusion	In agreement with Chang et al,17 significant perturbations, as much as 4–12 cm−1 are observed for the X̃(0,2,0), X̃(0,2,1), and X̃(0,2,2) vibrational levels.
Method	The electronic structure computations were based on high-level coupled cluster (CC) methods, up to quadruple excitations (CCSDTQ), and large-size correlation-consistent basis sets, ranging from aug-cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pV6Z, followed by extrapolation to the complete basis set limit.
Background	Xu, T. Sears and J. T. Muckerman entitled “Potential energy surfaces and vibrational energy levels of DCCl and HCCl in three low-lying states”.
Conclusion	Convergence of the higher-order electron correlation contributions, δCCSD(T)139 and above, with the one-particle basis set is even faster.
Background	The ã3A″ − X̃1A′ energy splitting, ΔETS, was estimated experimentally first by the analysis of the negative ion photoelectron spectrum of HCCl− by Lineberger et al21,22 In their first report they obtained 11 ± 0.3 kcal mol−1.21
Problem	In order to understand the source of this error we have added the pure fifth- and sixth-order bending force constants to the quartic force field and reran the variational calculations using this augmented force field (see the Var4+ columns of Tables 11 and 13).
Problem	In this work, we strive to produce calculations of ΔETS for both HCCl and CCl2 of “near-spectroscopic” accuracy.
Background	However, the structure of the rest of this section is organized in a way to follow the major steps of FPA and give insight for a reader not familiar with this approach.
Method	For DBOC energy correction calculations the Dunning–Huzinaga-type DZP and TZ2P basis sets124 have been used.
Background	This pioneering work was followed by numerous spectroscopic studies on the Ã ← X̃ transition both in the gas phase8–17 and in Ar matrix.7
Background	The first spectroscopic study on CCl2 was carried out in 1967 in an Ar matrix by Milligan and Jacox.23
Background	The enthalpy of formation, ΔfH298°, of CCl2 has been obtained experimentally in numerous ways including kinetic studies,48 electron impact experiments,49,53 ion cyclotron resonance techniques,45,50–52 collision induced dynamics studies,47,54 and by determination of the ionization potential.55
Background	In their recently published paper,17 which presented the analysis of new dispersed fluorescence spectra with much better signal-to-noise ratio, they have not only observed perturbations, but assigned some weak bands to the ã3A″ state.
Method	This level of electronic structure theory was chosen because it represents a well-known Pauling-point in the computational armamentarium, and according to our experience it provides an almost as good local PES as the best state-of-the-art ab initio surfaces (i.e. CBS extrapolated and augmented by auxiliary corrections)125.
Result	Some further converged variational results as well as results for other isotopologs can be found in the ESI.
Conclusion	A larger part of the uncertainty of the present calculation comes from the uncertainty of ΔfH0° of CH2(ã1A1) and a smaller portion from the uncertainty of ΔfH0° of HCl(X̃1Σ+).
Result	The deviation of the Var4 results from the experimental data set of Kable et al44 is somewhat worse, the rms error is 6.9 cm−1 for the same region.
Background	Since in these works the ground-state vibrational parameters were determined from the observed hot bands of the excitation spectra, these data were substantially refined by the analysis of the recently recorded43,44 dispersed fluorescence spectra.
Result	As can be seen from Table 6, the anharmonic and the G0 contributions to the triplet–singlet energy splitting are only on the order of 1–2 cm−1.
Conclusion	Considering the excellent performance of the Var4 results for the singlet state, the predictions for the triplet state are expected to be similarly good, which could help the further analysis of the experimental data, including the determination of T0(ã).
Result	Marking the calculated triplet state n2 vibrational progressions (and the first n3 level) in the same figure (Fig. 1) it is apparent that progressions starting from peaks A and B match the other peaks of the spectrum best.
Result	Using these force fields vibrational energy levels were computed both by second-order vibrational perturbation theory and variationally.
Conclusion	As expected, the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) to the triplet–singlet energy gap of HCCl/DCCl is smaller (see Table 5) than it was found for CH2.138
Result	As expected, the DBOC contribution (see Table 5) to the triplet–singlet energy gap is decreasing in the CH2, HCCl (DCCl), and CCl2 series.
Background	The new, revised ΔETS values were 6.20 ± 0.05 kcal mol−1 for HCCl and 6.25 ± 0.05 kcal mol−1 for DCCl.
Background	These two papers together report 83 and 40 assigned X̃-state vibrational levels for C35Cl2 and C35Cl37Cl, respectively.
Conclusion	In the former case the larger rms error is probably due to the lower precision of the experimental data set, while in the latter case it is the consequence of the less accurate theoretical treatment, i.e., perturbational vs. variational, of the nuclear motion problem.
Method	All the necessary force field transformations both for the VPT2 and the variational calculations have been carried out with the help of the INTDER135–137 program.
Background	Carbenes are among the most important of reactive chemical intermediates.
Method	Electron correlation was accounted for by standard methods of electronic structure theory: second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory,99 and the coupled cluster (CC) series, including single and double (CCSD),100 single, double and perturbatively estimated triple [CCSD(T)],101 single, double and triple (CCSDT),102,103 and single, double, triple and quadruple excitations (CCSDTQ).104,105
Method	The related structural parameters are collected in Table 1.
Method	At the same time, it is much more demanding to perform higher-order correlation calculations for CCl2 than for the smaller HCCl and CH2 systems.
Conclusion	Note that the present value, as well as recently published theoretical values,78,79 have at least an order of magnitude smaller uncertainty than the values given in the available thermochemical databases143–148.
Method	Relativistic electronic energy corrections were determined by the 1-electron mass-velocity–Darwin (MVD1)106,107 and the second-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess [DKH(2)]108–112 methods.
Background	All of these studies revealed strong and complicated perturbations caused by the Renner–Teller effect and spin–orbit coupling with the low-lying ã3A″ state.
Result	This value is equal to the calculated value of ref. 77, and it results in 54.83 ± 0.20 kcal mol−1 for ΔfH298° of CCl2(X̃1A1).
Conclusion	Somewhat surprisingly the perturbational predictions, which of course utilize the quartic force fields only, are better for the highly excited bending modes than the variational results.
Conclusion	In these situations, since both series converge ultimately to the same valence-only limit, the difference of the restricted and unrestricted methods at the same computational level indicates the uncertainty of the calculations due to the neglect of higher-order correlations.
Result	In the case of CCl2 the obtained CBS result for {ΔETS(HF), ΔETS(MP2), ΔETS(CCSD), ΔETS[CCSD(T)]} is {–22, 6660, 5896, 6997} cm−1 using an ROHF reference (see Table 7), and {–1710, 6922, 5864, 7021} cm−1 when an UHF reference is used.
Method	The total VPT2 ZPE value can be calculated by the following formula:where the three terms are the G0, the harmonic, and the anharmonic contributions, respectively.
Conclusion	Consequently the difference (see Section III.1) between the experimentally determined (20 cm−1) and the calculated (1 cm−1) difference of the T0(ã) of HCCl and DCCl would be slightly smaller if the computed values included spin–vibronic interactions.
Background	(The isotopologs containing 35Cl and 37Cl have the same BODC energy corrections to within 1 cm−1).
Conclusion	It is shown that due to the accuracy of these vibrational calculations they can help the further analysis of the dispersed fluorescence spectra, including the possible identification of the triplet state of CCl2.
Conclusion	Of course, this assignment should be considered only very preliminary and tentative.
Conclusion	Since these uncertainties are ±0.16 and ±0.024 kcal mol−1, respectively, we allocate a ±0.20 kcal mol−1 uncertainty to our final value of ΔfH0° (HCCl).
Background	These data were notably complemented by Chang et al,13,14 who have identified six and 11 vibrational levels in the dispersed fluorescence spectra of HCCl and DCCl, respectively.
Result	As it is expected, the predicted Var4 and Var4+ vibrational energy levels are the same within 1 cm−1 for modes with small n2 vibrational quantum numbers.
Result	Complete quartic force fields in internal coordinates have been computed for both the X̃ and ã states of both radicals at the frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level.
Conclusion	Furthermore, the uncertainties of the present results are smaller by a factor of 2–5 than the uncertainties of even the best of the former theoretical values, and more than an order of magnitude smaller than ΔfH0° given in the available thermochemical databases.
Method	As it is mentioned in the Introduction the electronic structure calculations have been carried out according to the recipe of the so-called focal-point approach documented well in recent publications.86,87
Conclusion	The Var4 results for the vibrational energy levels involving small bending quantum numbers still agree very well with the experimental data, while highly excited bending modes show significant (>15 cm−1) deviation from the experimental observations.
Result	These tables also contain the vibrational levels obtained by variational calculations and from experiments.
Method	The VPT2 calculations were performed using the ANHARM128 program package.
Conclusion	It is unlikely that these transitions are attributable to highly excited X̃ vibrational levels due to the poor Franck–Condon factors involved.
Conclusion	This is well demonstrated by the extremely large δCCSD(T) contribution, 691 cm−1 at the CBS limit.
Method	First, one does not need to consider prior to the fit which levels are perturbed and which are not and hence all appropriate levels can be considered.
Result	From the accurate theoretical values the enthalpies of formation of HCCl(X̃1A′) and CCl2(X̃1A1) were determined at 0 K, which are 76.28 ± 0.20 and 54.54 ± 0.20 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Result	On the other hand, the Var4 and Var4+ results for highly excited bending modes are rather different, the Var4+ energy levels are 15–40% closer to the experimental values than the corresponding Var4 ones.
Result	This cross term is three times larger in CCl2 than in HCCl.
Method	Reference geometries of CCl2 and HCCl for the single-point energy calculations within the focal-point approach and for the force field calculations have been obtained by geometry optimization at the all-electron CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVTZ level of theory.
Method	A well-established way to do this is the comparison of the correlation series using ROHF and UHF references.141
Result	Our best numerical estimates for the core correlation and the relativistic correction of the triplet–singlet energy gap of CCl2 are −176 ± 25 cm−1 and +91 ± 15 cm−1, respectively.
Background	Chang et al17 pointed out large perturbations with given ã-state vibrational levels for the X̃(0,2,0), X̃(0,2,1), and X̃(0,2,2) vibrational levels of HCCl and for the X̃(0,4,0) and the X̃(0,4,1) levels of DCCl.
Background	One of the interesting observations of ref. 20 was that the spin-rotation constants make a significant contribution to the hyperfine structure due to the relatively low-lying Ã state.
Method	First, the one-electron scalar contribution was obtained by the MVD1 perturbation method using the ROHF wave function.
Result	The enthalpy of formation of CCl2(X̃1A1) at 0 K, ΔfH0° (CCl2), calculated through Reaction (6), is 54.54 kcal mol−1.
Conclusion	These calculations serve to increase the precision of previous calculations significantly.
Result	From this we can deduce an 8–9 cm−1 perturbation between the X̃(0,2,0) level at 2383 cm−1 (experimental, Table 11) and the close-lying ã(0,0,0) level at 2167 cm−1 (experimental).
Result	Our final estimate for the valence-only triplet–singlet energy gap is 2205 ± 35 cm−1.
Result	The vibrational energy levels of singlet HCCl and DCCl computed variationally from the quartic force field (see the Var4 columns of Tables 11 and 13) show excellent agreement with the experimentally observed levels up to 3000 cm−1.
Method	To obtain the best estimate for T0 (ã), one sums the lowest, rightmost numbers in Tables 2–4 and the corresponding bottommost numbers in Tables 5 and 6.
Result	Similarly to findings for CH2,138 the ZPE correction is larger for the triplet state, the numerical results for the HCCl and DCCl radicals are 47 and 50 cm−1, respectively.
Conclusion	The estimate for HCCl is in very good agreement with the recently revised experimental value, 2167/2187 ± 18 cm−1 for HCCl/DCCl, of Chang et al,17 while the estimate for CCl2 supports alternative reassessments76,81 of the photodetachment spectrum of CCl2− over the original assignment,42 as well as the experimental lower limit value of T0(ã) suggested by Liu et al43
Method	In this paper we estimate these spin–vibronic perturbations a similar way, but instead of the fitted expansion we use the Var4+ results.
Conclusion	Although further converged Var4 results are available in the ESI, due to the high density of vibrational levels above 4000 cm−1 the assignment of these energy states to given vibrational quantum numbers is ambiguous without detailed wave function analysis.
Background	For an even more detailed summary of the experimental and theoretical evaluations of the triplet–singlet energy splittings and enthalpies of formation of HCCl and CCl2 see Tables S1–S4 of the electronic supplementary information (ESI).
Result	The DBOC contribution, in the case of CCl2, is only 5 ± 2 cm−1.
Conclusion	Although the corresponding rms errors of the perturbationally obtained energy levels are somewhat larger, 5.4 and 5.9 cm−1, this still can be considered as a fine performance for a simple, purely theoretical treatment.
Background	Some further Ne,41 Ar,18,25 and Kr18 matrix IR studies have confirmed this assignment, while fluorescence studies in cryogenic matrices26–28 resulted in a value for the bending fundamental (ν2) of 333 cm−1 in Ar, for the first time.
Result	Furthermore, again similarly to observations for CH2,138 inclusion of core correlation is important, it considerably stabilizes the triplet state with respect to the singlet state (see Table 3).
Conclusion	From the fist three members, {−3, −6, −17}, of this error series only a very rough estimate of the perturbation effects can be determined, for X̃(0,2,2), 6–10 cm−1.
Conclusion	It is also in good correspondence with the observations for CH2 and other previous studies that, due to the opposite signs of the δCCSD and the δCCSD(T) contributions the MP2 level of theory, with a large enough (e.g., cc-pCVQZ) basis set, estimates well the converged core correlation contribution, which is determined in this study to be −146 ± 20 cm−1.
Conclusion	Although this perturbation is not included in our theoretical treatment, the estimation of the magnitude of this perturbation, based on the comparison of the computed and the experimentally observed vibrational levels, will be discussed in Section V.1.
Conclusion	If the coupling is too small, the emissions to triplet state levels might not appear in the dispersed fluorescence spectrum at all.
Result	The enthalpy of formation of HCCl(X̃1A′) at 0 K, ΔfH0o (HCCl), calculated from the enthalpy change of reaction (5) and ΔfH0o of CH2(ã1A1),138 HCl(X̃1Σ+),91 and H2(X̃1Σg)90 is 76.28 kcal mol−1.
Background	Some suggested directions for future experiments utilizing these computed data will be discussed briefly in Section VI.
Background	The only smaller difference between our and their results is in the numerical value (4 vs. 22 cm−1, respectively) of the perturbation between the ã(0,1,0) and X̃(0,2,1) levels of HCCl.
Conclusion	It is evident that the X̃(0,2,2) level of HCCl at 3976 cm−1 can be perturbed by the close-lying ã(0,2,0) and the ã(0,1,1) vibrational levels at 3915 cm−1 and 3983 cm−1 (experimental T0(ã) + Var4+ vibrational level), respectively.
Background	In this study 54.48 ± 0.4 kcal mol−1 was obtained for ΔfH0°, which, when combined with other reliable results,77 gives 54.8 ± 0.4 kcal mol−1 for ΔfH298°.
Conclusion	(iv) The well-known imbalanced treatment of the two electronic states at the HF level of theory is slowly corrected as the single-reference electron correlation treatment is improved.
Conclusion	Since the bond angles, and consequently the rotational constants are remarkably different in the singlet and triplet states (see Table 1), one possibility would be to record the rotationally resolved stimulated emission pumping (SEP) spectrum of CCl2.
Background	In their first dispersed fluorescence reports Chang et al,13,14 due to the lack of perturbations in the observed X̃ state vibrational levels, determined the low limits of the triplet–singlet energy splitting for HCCl/DCCl as ≈8/11 kcal mol−1 with an error estimate of ±2 kcal mol−1.
Method	The thermal correction of the enthalpy of formation of CCl2(X̃1A1) can be obtained as follows: ΔfH298° − ΔfH0°[CCl2] (X̃1A1)] = {H298 − H0[CCl2(X̃1A1)]} − {H298−H0[Cgraphite]} − {[Cl2 (X̃1Σg)]} = {2.737}90 − {2.194}90 − {0.251}79 kcal mol−1 = 0.292 kcal mol−1.
Problem	It will also report related thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of these molecules.
Result	In this paper the best technically feasible values for the triplet–singlet energy gap of the HCCl/DCCl and CCl2 radicals have been determined through the focal-point approach.
Result	Complete quartic force fields in internal coordinates have been computed for both the X̃ and ã states of both radicals at the frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level.
Background	At present these values seem to be the most dependable experimental estimates of ΔETS of HCCl.
Result	If the trend in the errors is systematic, one would expect a +6 – +7 cm−1 error for the X̃(0,2,0) mode.
Conclusion	These estimates are in an excellent agreement with the recently revised experimental value, 2167/2187 ± 18 cm−1 for HCCl/DCCl, of Chang et al17 On the other hand, the experimentally obtained difference of T0(ã) of HCCl and DCCl is considerably larger than the theoretically computed difference.
Method	The final estimate of this study for T0(ã) of CCl2 is obtained by summing the lowest, rightmost numbers in Tables 5–9.
Result	The resulting values of HCCl and DCCl are 2170 ± 40 cm−1 (6.204 ± 0.114 kcal mol−1) and 2171 ± 40 cm−1 (6.207 ± 0.114 kcal mol−1), respectively.
Background	Efforts to obtain a new experimental value for the triplet–singlet energy gap have also been made by analyzing the laser-induced dispersed fluorescence spectrum of CCl2.43
Conclusion	Similarly to this, both the X̃(0,4,0) and the X̃(0,4,1) levels of DCCl fall in the energy region where the accuracy of the present variational calculations starts to deteriorate, consequently no reliable estimate of the perturbation effects can be determined based on the present data.
Background	Although the two methods approximate the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian by different partitioning schemes, due to the effective treatment of the first- and second-row elements by these relativistic perturbation techniques this difference basically covers the two-electron scalar and spin–orbit relativistic corrections within the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian.
Background	Hence, only a lower limit of 14 kcal mol−1 could be determined from this experiment.
Method	Since the contribution of the relativistic effects is expected to be more important in the case of HCCl than in CH2 it was computed in a somewhat more careful manner.
Conclusion	Unfortunately, the fourth member of the X̃(0,n2,2) series already falls in the region where the accuracy of the variational calculations is not sufficient to be included in the error series.
Result	Furthermore, the total VPT2 ZPE correction agrees with the variational results to about 1 cm−1.
Background	Among these predictions for ΔfH298° the most reliable, 76.5 ± 1 kcal mol−1, was obtained by basis set extrapolation of CCSD(T) energies and inclusion of scalar relativistic corrections.77
Background	Although the spectrum of CCl2 has been recorded up to 8500 cm−1, due to its complexity, e.g., the occurrence of Fermi resonances and an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, in the high-energy region it could be fully and unambiguously assigned to X̃-state vibrational levels “only” up to 5000 cm−1.
Method	Small corrections due to core correlation, relativistic effects, diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction, as well as harmonic and anharmonic zero-point vibrational energy corrections have been taken into account.
Conclusion	It really just demonstrates that there are transitions in this spectral region consistent with the presence of the ã state.
Result	Within the error bar of the theoretically determined T0(ã), three–four peaks can be assigned to the vibrational origin of the triplet state; namely, A: 6954 ± 5 cm−1, B: 7012 ± 5 cm−1, C: 7033 ± 5 cm−1, and D: 7071 ± 10 cm−1.
Method	Corrections beyond the Dirac–Coulomb theory113 (e.g., the Breit term) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) contributions (Lamb-shift),114 which supposed to be much smaller than the remaining uncertainty of the non-relativistic calculations, were neglected in this study.
Conclusion	Because of the high density of states in this region, spectra obtained at higher resolution and with better signal-to-noise ratio could notably facilitate arguments about the assignment.
Background	This was omitted in the present study.
Background	This has ignited a huge trepidation in the community of theoretically oriented chemists and inspired several groups to perform more accurate theoretical predictions and publish papers on the “surprising difference”75 or on the “remarkable discrepancy between theory and experiment”66 including these new estimates for the triplet–singlet splitting: 19.5 ± 2 kcal mol−1 (2000),75 20.0 ± 1 kcal mol−1 (2000),76 {19.2, 20.9} kcal mol−1 (2000),77 {14.7–21.5} kcal mol−1 (2000),66 {21.0, 21.5, 19.9} kcal mol−1 (2001),68 19.8 kcal mol−1 (2003).80
Method	Reference electronic wave functions have been determined by the single-configuration restricted-open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF) method.
Problem	In Section V accurate ab initio determination of the enthalpies of formation, ΔfHT°, of HCCl and CCl2 is described, utilizing FPA results of this study and related existing high-quality thermochemical data.88–92
Conclusion	Our best estimate is +10 ± 4 cm−1 and +8 ± 4 cm−1 for HCCl and DCCl, respectively.
Conclusion	The importance of the inclusion of the higher order bending force constants is connected to the fact that the barrier to linearity of HCCl in its X̃ state is relatively low, 17 766 cm−1 at the all-electron CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVTZ level.
Result	Due to the abovementioned error compensation of the total energy of CH2(ã1A1) and HCCl(X̃1A′) the enthalpy change of reaction (5) is expected to be estimated to better than ±0.1 kcal mol−1.
Method	Estimation of the complete basis set (CBS) limits have been performed by well-established extrapolation formulas, namely by an exponential formula,122EX = ECBS + aexp(−bX)in the case of HF and an inverse power formula,123EX = ECBS + cX−3for both the frozen-core and all-electron correlated energy increments.
Background	In this matrix isolation IR study the symmetric and the antisymmetric stretching frequencies, 748 and 721 cm−1 for C35Cl2 and 726 and 700 cm−1 for C35Cl37Cl, respectively, were obtained, but without an unambiguous assignment of which is which.
Background	The MRCI calculations reported in this paper are in good agreement with our results.
Conclusion	(iii) The δMP2 and δCCSD contributions converge rather slowly, the change of their absolute value from the aug-cc-pCVDZ basis set to the CBS limit is 977 and 522 cm−1, respectively.
Problem	Since the technical details and the qualitative observations during determination of the triplet–singlet energy gap of CCl2 by the FPA were similar to those for CH2 and HCCl, here we mostly concentrate on the differences and the tendencies in the CH2/HCCl/CCl2 substitution series.
Conclusion	These results, especially the variational ones, show excellent agreement with the experimentally determined energy levels.
Background	These calculations resulted in ΔETS = 1.6 kcal mol−1.
Method	Vibrational energy levels were computed using formulas based on second-order vibrational perturbational theory (VPT2)126–129 and by an approximately variational discrete variable representation (DVR)130–132 technique.133
Result	The rms error calculated from comparing the Liu et al43 data set with the VPT2 results is even larger, it is 9.7 cm−1.
Method	Finally, it is noted that larger errors can be by-passed if they are systematic for a given series.
Result	Using these force fields vibrational energy levels of {HCCl, DCCl, CCl2} up to {6000, 5000, 7000} cm−1 were calculated both by second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) and variationally.
Method	Computation of the mass-dependent diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) was performed by the BORN program operating within the PSI 2 program package at the Hartree–Fock level, using the formalism of Handy, Yamaguchi and Schaefer.115
Method	The (stretch, stretch, bend) quartic force fields were first transformed to (SPF, SPF, bend) coordinates, where SPF stands for Simons–Parr–Finlan134 coordinates, where the forces were neglected, then to Cartesian coordinates, the necessary inputs of ANHARM.
Result	As can be seen from Table 4 the relativistic correction calculated by MVD1 perturbation theory and an ROHF wave function estimates the final result well, both the two-electron and the electron-correlation contributions to the total relativistic correction are small.
Conclusion	The accuracy of these calculations and the systematic behavior of errors of vibrational progressions allowed us to determine the extent of perturbations due to spin–vibronic coupling between singlet and triplet vibrational levels of HCCl.
Background	The enthalpy of formation, ΔfH298°, of HCCl was obtained experimentally by ion cyclotron resonance (ICR)45,46 and collision induced dynamics (CID)47 techniques, which resulted in 71 ± 5 kcal mol−1 (1985),45 75.7 ± 4.8 kcal mol−1 (1994),46 and 80.4 ± 2.8 kcal mol−1 (1997).47
Background	The first reliable ab initio study on ΔETS of HCCl was published by Bauschlicher et al in .197756
Background	After submission of the paper we have received a manuscript from H.-G.
Conclusion	Our final estimate of the relativistic corrections to ΔETS is +54 ± 10 cm−1.
Background	The analysis of the dispersed fluorescence spectra also resulted in triplet–singlet energy splitting values for HCCl and DCCl.
Conclusion	These results are in good agreement with other recent calculations.
Problem	The purpose of this paper is to reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions for the above-discussed spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of the HCCl and CCl2 radicals by using sophisticated theoretical techniques.
Problem	In Section IV vibrational energy levels calculated both perturbationally and variationally from an accurate quartic force field representation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of HCCl and CCl2 are presented.
Conclusion	These results, especially the variational ones, show excellent agreement with the experimentally determined energy levels.
Method	In the valence-only correlated-level calculations the 1s orbital of C and the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals of Cl were kept doubly occupied.
Result	As expected, the variationally calculated vibrational levels of singlet CCl2 show an even better agreement with the experimental observations than it was found for HCCl and DCCl.
Result	All the vibrational energies presented were converged to better than 0.01 cm−1.
Method	For the enthalpies of formation of HCl(X̃1Σ+), H2(X̃1Σg), and CH2(ã1A1), required to evaluate ΔfH0° (HCCl) and ΔfH0° (CCl2), see Table 17.
Conclusion	They are also expected to complement experimental work, which ultimately should produce a gold standard of measurement for ΔETS.
Background	In contrast to these, other measurements, including the most recent ones scatter between 51 and 57 kcal mol−1: 56.5 ± 5 kcal mol−1 (1968),49 53.8 ± 2 kcal mol−1 (1977),51 52.1 ± 3.4 kcal mol−1 (1991),54 51.0 ± 2.0 kcal mol−1 (1993),55 55.0 ± 2.0 kcal mol−1 (1985).47
Method	(A correct analytic formula for the computation of the G0 term from quartic force fields for asymmetric tops has been derived by Allen et al.140)
Method	In some variational calculations the quintic and sextic diagonal bending internal coordinate force constants have also been included to improve the description of the bending motion.

Method	Taking into account the fact that the electrons are characterized by free-like behavior12 in rare-gas solids, in other words, they are highly mobile, one can expect an efficient recombination on the electron thermalization.
Conclusion	Bearing this in mind, one can assume that the short-lived defect of the off-center configuration can be stabilized by the reorientation of the dimer axis to the 〈100〉 direction (d in Fig. 5).
Problem	Let us take up possible channels of electronically induced defect creation keeping in mind that the key point for this process is the relaxation energy release in a confined region of the crystal.
Method	The samples were grown in a closed cell with an electromagnetic shutter mounted on a L-He cryostat holder in the vacuum chamber.
Method	The energy release during the M-STE vibronic cooling ΔE*(M-STE) is about 0.45 eV 36 which is higher than the binding energy per atom in solid Xe (172.3 meV .12)
Result	The excitation above the Γ(3/2) exciton band bottom resulted in the appearance of two subbands with the predominance of a M2 subband at 7.22 eV.
Background	A special type of lattice defects is an electronically induced point defect–Frenkel pair.
Method	The energy needed for the reorientation can be released in the lattice in the course of the vibronic relaxation.
Background	Defects of structure are of substantial importance in the kinetics of solid-state chemical reactions and have a pronounced effect on the efficiency of formation and stability of radicals and ionic species in cryogenic solids.
Background	In contrast to the case of exciton self-trapping into atomic states the luminescence spectra of molecular self-trapped excitons (M-STE) have a shape of broad bands stemming from the electronic transition from the 1,3Σ+u to a repulsive part of the ground state 1Σ+g (the well-known M bands.12,14,15)
Result	Each of the subbands approximated by the Gaussian is depicted in Fig. 1.
Background	The results obtained in combination with the activation spectroscopy study19,20 supported the theoretical model21,22 of the evolution of atomic self-trapped excitons (A-STE) into permanent lattice defects—Frenkel pairs of the second neighbour configuration.
Result	The shape of the M band in the luminescence spectrum of solid Xe measured at different excitation energies—below the bottom of the lowest exciton band n = 1 Γ(3/2) and in the range of the exciton absorption—is shown in Fig. 2 where the difference in the position and halfwidth FWHM of the M band is clearly seen.
Method	The position and FWHM of the M1 and M2 subbands were obtained from the numerical fit of the band shape assuming a Gaussian shape of the subbands.
Method	The samples of required quality were grown in a special closed cell mounted on a He-flow cryostat holder in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment (10−10 mbr).
Method	The samples were condensed from the vapour phase at elevated temperature under isobaric conditions (P = 1000 Pa) with a constant cooling in the temperature range 125–110 K. Then the temperature was controllably reduced at a constant rate of 0.1 Ks−1.
Result	The intensity of the M2 subband related to the exciton self-trapped in the regular lattice remains constant.
Problem	The lattice defect creation was studied using the selective vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy methods.
Background	The recent study suggested this band to be originated from trimer Xe3*43.
Background	The computational results were presented for Ar and Kr cryoscrystals and it was mentioned that the formation of crowdions is also expected in the Xe lattice.
Result	The separation between the “dumb-bell” atoms is found to be 0.86d (d is the distance between the nearest neighbours), which only slightly exceeds the interatomic distance between the atoms in the Xe2* dimer (0.31 nm).
Conclusion	One can suggest that on long-term exposure there occurs an aggregation of defects.
Method	The center formed resembles a “dumb-bell” configuration of the interstitial atom.
Method	The experiments were performed at the Laboratory of Condensed System Spectroscopy at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics & Engineering NASU.
Method	The efficiency of this defect creation channel via recombination depends on the rate of electron thermalization and is not expected to be high.
Result	The earlier data on the excitation spectra obtained by the “red–blue-side” separation method31 supported the assignment of the M2 subband as originated from the M-STE in the regular lattice whereas the M1 subband was assigned to the exciton of molecular configuration trapped in the defect site.
Background	Another interesting example to mention is the influence of local matrix morphology on the formation of neutral ground-state chemical compounds involving rare-gas atoms.11
Problem	The temporal evolution of the intensity distribution in the band of molecular type self-trapped exciton luminescence was analyzed.
Background	Physics and chemistry in cryomatrices is an active research field and rare-gas matrices have been used frequently in studies over many years.1–7
Conclusion	The excitation energy is transferred to the defects by free excitons followed by their trapping and radiative decay yielding the M1 subband.
Method	At both relaxation stages an essential amount of energy ΔE+(STH) and ΔE(DRec) is released in the vicinity of STH, which can be spent on the lattice defect creation.
Problem	A sequence of spectra were measured upon exposure to the VUV light.
Result	Note that the exposure time is not corrected for the synchrotron radiation pulse duration, so it is in fact a real time of the measurements.
Method	Note that STH and M-STE might be considered as “matrix isolated” molecular centers within its own host crystal.
Method	The contribution of the initial defects can be easily found by extrapolating the dose dependence of the M1 subband intensity to zero.
Method	The selective excitation was carried out with a bandpass of Δλ = 0.25 nm.
Background	The vacancy also becomes delocalized, forming a smeared sparsed region (anticrowdion).
Result	During the next 100 min we observed a saturation of the dose dependence of the M1 intensity followed by a slow decrease with long irradiation time.
Background	To cite an example, the stabilization effect of structural defects on the intrinsic ionic species Rg2+, so-called self-trapped holes (STH), in cryomatrices was recently found in the experiments carried out at Bondybey’s Laboratory.9,10
Method	It was shown37 that the split 〈100〉 “dumb-bell” form is the only stable form of the interstitial atom in the Xe lattice.
Background	The rare-gas solids are characterized by extremely small binding energies in comparison with the energies of electronic excitations.
Method	While relaxing through the vibronic levels, the positively charged dimer STH can recombine with a thermalized electron into a repulsive electronic state yielding two Rg atoms separated energetically (a so called dissociative recombination DRec).
Background	The self-trapping of excitons into atomic states is suggested to be a stimulating factor.
Method	The electron-hole pairs were generated by a short-term exposure to the VUV radiation.
Background	The accumulation of radiation-induced defects was detected in all heavy rare-gas solids—Ar, Kr and Xe.23,25–27
Background	The spectroscopic investigation of lattice defect creation in the case of exciton self-trapping into molecular states, as occurred in solid Xe, Kr and Ar, is a rigorous task.
Result	The procedure applied enabled us to estimate the low energy excitation thresholds E1 and E2 for the M1 and M2 subbands, respectively: E1 = 8.18 eV, E2 = 8.28 eV.
Method	The samples were excited by synchrotron radiation in the range of excitonic absorption.
Conclusion	Analysis of the intensity redistribution upon exposure to the VUV light in the range of the exciton absorption enabled us to gain clear evidence for the permanent lattice defect creation via exciton self-trapping into the molecular state.
Method	However, the direct proof of the excitonic mechanism requires experiments with state-selective excitation.
Method	The samples were then subjected to prolonged irradiation by the VUV light.
Result	The intensity of the M2 subband associated with the M-STE in the regular lattice remained constant during exposure to the VUV light.
Result	The existence of the two subbands points to a branching of the relaxation channels.
Method	If a part of the electrons is trapped in some defect sites, STHs remain stable in the lattice at temperatures low enough to prohibit the release of the electrons from their traps.
Background	TSL of solid Xe at the photon energy 7.2 eV after irradiation by X-rays was observed in ref. 41 but the M1 and M2 subbands in the TSL band were not discriminated.
Result	The excitation below the exciton band gave rise to a defect M1 subband with a maximum at 7.05 eV.
Method	The self-trapping occurring during the lifetime of the excited state results in the formation of a molecular dimer aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic directions with an interatomic distance of 0.31 nm.35
Method	The first stage of these reactions corresponds to the self-trapping of holes (1) and excitons (2) followed by the formation of vibronically hot charged (STH) and neutral (M-STE) dimers.
Method	Investigation of electronically induced lattice rearrangement requires definite experimental conditions—first, high quality samples with low concentration of initial defects and impurities, then subthreshold excitation of the samples using slow particles of energy deficient to produce defects via knock-on mechanism or photons of appropriate energy, and finally, excitation of the samples at low temperatures to exclude the conventional thermally-activated defect creation.
Method	The primary monochromator was tuned to the energy of the n = 2 Γ(3/2) band in the absorption spectrum of solid Xe.
Background	The interpretation was supported by the recent experiments on selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.24
Method	The relevant relaxation processes involving the self-trapping of holes and excitons can be given by the reactions:RgH+ + Rg → Rg2+ + ΔE+(STH) → Rg2++ e → Rg* + Rg + ΔE(DRec)RgE* + Rg → Rg2* + ΔE*(M-STE) → hν (M-STE) + Rg + Rg + ΔE(D)We take RgH+ and RgE* to denote a free hole and free exciton, respectively.
Background	The comprehensive study performed in pure and doped Kr matrices28 permitted us to suggest mechanisms of defect creation via exciton self-trapping into molecular states.
Result	The distinct enhancement of the defect subband M1 upon irradiation indicates an increase in the number of defect sites, i.e. accumulation of permanent lattice defects.
Result	The recorded TSL spectrum is shown in Fig. 6.
Background	Note that the TSL from solid Xe grown at low temperature yielded a 7.6 eV band.42
Method	The following decomposition of the M band into M1 and M2 subbands yielded the dose dependence of the defect component and the regular one.
Problem	The influence of the annealing at 60 K on the intensity distribution in the M band was examined.
Result	The resulting excitation spectra are shown in Fig. 3.
Background	This peculiarity in conjunction with the strong electron–phonon interaction followed by the self-trapping of excitons and holes12,14,15 results in a high quantum yield for the electronically induced processes, making the rare-gas matrices excellent objects for studying the topic under consideration.
Method	It seems to be the case for the M-STE relaxation which offers the basis for the development of the “excited state” mechanism.
Method	The sequence of luminescence spectra was recorded using a normal incidence 1 m VUV monochromator with a bandpass of Δλ = 0.16 nm.
Method	The secondary electrons produced under excitation well above Eg for the most part remain in the solid, and hence each hole has, in the mean, its counterpart—an electron elsewhere.
Method	The dose was increased with exposure time.
Background	The difference in energies is of the order of 102–103.
Method	We used a combination of the luminescence analysis, excitation spectroscopy, and thermally stimulated luminescence.
Problem	This paper reports the results of a synchrotron radiation study into permanent lattice defect creation in the Xe matrix via excitonic mechanism.
Method	However, there are no stable interstitials of the “dumb-bell” configuration aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic direction.37
Method	The irradiation was performed under steady state conditions with a current density of 50 μA cm−2.
Method	To restore the excitation spectra we used the following procedure:24 a series of luminescence spectra were recorded with a successive increase of the excitation energy, then the luminescence spectra recorded were resolved into the M1 and the M2 components and the intensities of each subband were plotted as a function of the excitation energy.
Result	In view of the low TSL intensity the spectrum was collected over the heating time.
Result	Note that at low temperatures the thermally activated diffusion of vacancies to sinks is negligible and only the radiation-induced defect motion comes to play.
Result	However, because of the strong overlapping of the two subbands the direct measurement of the separate excitation spectra of the M1 and M2 subbands is impossible.
Result	Ionizing radiation (electrons in our case) creates primary excitations—free electron-hole pairs.
Method	The Frank–Condon transition of this dimer to the ground state will correspond to the transition of the molecular center to the permanent defect level with almost no change in the interatomic distance.
Background	Despite the aforementioned attractive properties of the rare-gas solids the experimental study into electronically induced defect creation was undertaken not so long ago.
Conclusion	Because of low intensity, reliable decomposition of the M band in the TSL spectrum is impossible.
Background	These defects are created in different classes of wide-gap insulators12 and even in narrow-gap materials.13
Result	The solid line represents the total yield of the luminescence in the M band as a function of the excitation energy.
Problem	Based on this assignment we measured the dose dependence of the M1 and M2 subbands to probe the defect creation upon excitation in the exciton band.
Result	The careful check of the spatial distribution of the centers emitting M1 and M2 subbands, performed with the electron beam of different energy, and hence, of different penetration depth, demonstrated the bulk origin of both centers.24
Method	Its displacement along the 〈110〉 direction to an off-center configuration (position c in Fig. 5) cannot stabilize the center.
Problem	In order to distinguish clearly the recombination (1) and excitonic (2) channels of defect creation the direct experiments with selective excitation into the exciton band were performed.
Method	The excitation energy was chosen in the range of the n = 2 term of the Γ(3/2) excitonic series.
Result	The result of this treatment—the corresponding points of the curves—yields the dose dependence of the subband intensity shown in Fig. 4.
Conclusion	The method of lattice defect detection developed in our studies16,17,23 is in fact a modification of the sensitized luminescence method.
Result	The comparison with the luminescence spectrum excited by photons of 8.86 eV energy (in the band of intrinsic exciton absorption of solid Xe) shows that the TSL band consists of two components M1 and M2.
Method	These high-resolution spectral studies revealed a creation and accumulation of point defects in the Ne lattice under irradiation by slow electrons.
Background	The exciton self-trapping caused by exciton–phonon interaction was found in all rare-gas solids and reported in a number of books, reviews and papers.12,14,15,31–35
Method	As the theory shows,38 in a system with a strong local vibration the energy release proceeds in a jump-like multiphonon process.
Method	In accordance with this consideration, the mechanisms of exciton-induced defect creation can be classified as an “excited state” mechanism and a “ground state” one.28
Result	A direct evidence for the creation and accumulation of point lattice defects in solid Xe via the excitonic mechanism was obtained for the first time.
Method	The irradiation and measurements were performed at low temperature (15 K) in order to exclude the conventional thermal mechanism of defect creation and to avoid the annealing of the defects produced.
Problem	If the hole is trapped in a defect site one can expect the appearance of the M1 subband in the TSL spectrum.
Method	The design of a special cryogenic cell23 for sample growth enabled us to grow samples of high crystal quality and to reveal the internal structure of the M bands.
Method	For comparison, we replicated the experiments with excitation by an electron beam following the identical procedure of the sample growing.
Method	After the sample preparation and cooling, the cell was removed and the free-standing cryocrystal of 1 mm thickness was studied.
Method	This stage followed by the M-STE formation in the on-center position is shown in Fig. 5 (a and b).
Result	Due to the low absorption coefficient the exciting light penetrated deep inside the sample, and the M-STE dimers were efficiently formed in the bulk.
Method	The synchrotron radiation providing an intense VUV light tunable through the range of excitonic absorption of rare-gas solids is best suited to such an experiment.
Conclusion	However, the contribution of both subbands can be ascertained.
Conclusion	First of all, the origin of the M1 and M2 subbands was verified using the advantages of the selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.
Background	The basis for the physics of electronically induced lattice rearrangement is a concentration of the excitation energy released in the relaxation process within a volume about that of a unit cell followed by the energy transfer to the surrounding matrix.
Method	In the case of exciton self-trapping by reaction (2) the relaxation energy is transferred to the surrounding atoms at both stages—in the excited state of the M-STE and in the ground state.
Result	At low temperatures and small doses, the reactions of recombination and trapping are extremely slow, and we observe a linear increase of the M1 subband intensity indicating the accumulation of defects in the sample.
Background	The existence of these two components in the M bands provides a way for application of the sensitive VUV luminescence spectroscopy method to characterize the samples and to study the electronically induced defect creation.
Method	High-purity Xe gas (99.9996%) was used, and the gas handling system was operated under UHV conditions.
Problem	We performed the experiment with detection of a thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) spectrum of the samples irradiated by VUV photons.
Problem	The experimental findings are compared with the results obtained under electron beam irradiation, and discussed in relation to the suggested model of defect creation.
Method	The matter is that during self-trapping Rg atoms are brought closer together displacing along the 〈110〉 direction, as shown in Fig. 5b.
Problem	Creation of permanent lattice defects via exciton self-trapping into molecular states in Xe matrix
Method	On completion of the irradiation the spectrum of the TSL was recorded.
Conclusion	The results obtained provided solid evidence of the “defect” nature of the M1 subband and the intrinsic nature of the M2 subband—emission of the true M-STE center in the regular lattice.
Background	Whereas in the case of “matrix-site” effect the defects adversely affect guest optical spectra causing a band broadening, the presence of defects, which can be seen as charge traps, is favourable for stabilization of ionic species in cryomatrices.
Background	The part of the defects in the accumulation of matrix-isolated species has already been discussed in earlier studies1,8 and the well-known “matrix-site” effect often involves lattice imperfections.
Method	The luminescence analysis was performed with Δλ = 2 nm by using a 0.5 m high-flux Pouey VUV monochromator equipped with a multisphere plate detector.
Result	Apparently, both kinds of defects—the initial structural defects and the defects created via electronic excitation—contribute to the M1 subband.
Problem	The internal structure and the intensity distribution were analyzed.
Method	The model of defect creation by the “ground state” mechanism is not as straightforward as it may seem at first sight.
Method	The dose dependence of radiation-induced point defect (e.g. vacancies) concentration Cv is described by the following equation∂Cv/∂t = Kdc − Kr (CiCv) − Ci0Cv0) − Kt (Cv − Cv0)Here Kdc is the coefficient that characterizes the rate of permanent defect creation via exciton self-trapping, whereas Kr and Kt are the coefficients of the vacancy-interstitial recombination and trapping by some kind of sinks, respectively.
Result	At the first stage of VUV irradiation (up to 100 min) we observed a pronounced enhancement of the M1 subband intensity.
Method	After the sample preparation and its cooling, the shutter was open providing the free access for the electron beam and emerging luminescence.
Method	To probe the defects we used thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL).
Background	The direct experimental proof of this mechanism of defect creation was provided by a recent study carried out with synchrotron radiation.18
Method	The study to be described was performed at the SUPERLUMI station of the Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor HASYLAB at DESY.
Conclusion	Free excitons can be then self-trapped in the regular lattice or trapped in some defect site.
Background	The recent theoretical studies39,40 showed that in the fcc lattice of rare-gas solids the weak coupling between close-packed atomic rows and the crystal matrix may give rise to an interstitial atom of a specific configuration—a smeared clump called a crowdion.
Result	The recombination of STHs with electrons gives rise to the self-trapped excitons emitting the M2 subband.
Conclusion	The existence of two subbands of molecular luminescence was verified—a defect related component and component originated from the exciton self-trapping in the regular lattice.
Method	As was already mentioned, two efficient channels of electronic excitation self-trapping exist in the lattice of heavy rare-gas solids–formation of STEs and STHs.
Problem	Let us discuss some possible models of exciton-induced defect creation via self-trapping into molecular states—M-STE.
Method	The entire M band was periodically recorded during exposure.
Conclusion	The details of the defect transformation on long-term irradiation invite further investigation.
Conclusion	Three channels of “indirect” exciton creation were found under selective excitation above the band gap energy Eg: (i) recombination of electron-hole pairs, (ii) inelastic scattering of electrons, and (iii) excitonic side bands of valence or inner-shell excitation.30
Result	With increasing the concentration of the radiation-induced Frenkel pairs (interstitials and vacancies) the contribution of the defect annihilation processes (second and third terms of the equation) increases.
Result	Fig. 1 demonstrates the internal structure of the M band in solid Xe and its temporal evolution under excitation by slow electrons.
Problem	In order to shed more light on the origin of the internal structure of the M band, we restored the excitation spectra of the M1 and M2 subbands.
Result	These changes are caused by the intensity redistribution between the two components of its internal structure—M1 and M2.
Result	The dose dependence of the subband intensity is shown in the insert of Fig. 1.
Conclusion	The model of permanent lattice defect creation and transformation is discussed.
Method	After the radiative transition (hν (M-STE)) of the relaxed M-STE to a repulsive part of the ground state potential, the excess energy ΔE(D) = 0.86 eV is shared between two dimer atoms, in other words, there appear the two “hot” atoms with a 0.43 eV kinetic energy available for the defect creation.
Result	The polycrystalline samples thus produced were optically transparent.
Result	The intense luminescence of free excitons indicated their high quality.
Method	Even in our first studies23,25 slow electrons were used for the excitation in order to prevent the knock-on defect creation—formation of defects by elastic collisions.
Method	The first efforts were concentrated on defect creation via self-trapping of excitons into atomic states that is the case for solid Ne.16,17
Problem	The electronically induced lattice rearrangement of solid Xe was studied by the VUV spectroscopy methods under selective excitation with synchrotron radiation.
Method	We used electrons of 1 keV energy, deficient to create defects by knock-on collisions.
Result	The shape of the M band profoundly varies with exposure time.
Background	It has been shown that the M band in all rare-gas solids consists of two components—M1 (related to the molecular centers in the defect sites) and M2 (related to the molecular centers formed in the regular lattice at the exciton self-trapping).
Result	Electronic excitation is shown to affect the structural properties of the Xe matrix at low temperatures.
Method	The set-up designed for luminescence experiments in the VUV range is given elsewhere,29 so only essential details are mentioned here.

Method	O2 was pulsed in all cases (100 µl, every 75 s).
Method	TPR profiles are designated as severe reduction (SR) procedures; after TPR, cool to 700 K and oxidise (mild oxidation—MO) in O2 (1 h), or oxidise at 1173 or 1273 K (severe oxidation—SO).
Conclusion	Thus, aspects of the behaviour reported in Fig. 1 are consistent with previous observations.8,9
Background	It is known that the temperature at which CZMOs release oxygen under reducing conditions may be decreased or increased upon application of SR/MO or SO treatment regimes.3,4,8,9
Conclusion	Despite this, pyrochloric structure was observed only in Fig. 2B, corresponding to TPR profile B1′, thereby indicating that extent of reduction is not directly responsible for pyrochlore formation.
Result	Consistent with the suggestion of the importance of surface modifications, studies carried out on the present sample indicated that the scrambling capacity between D2 and surface hydroxyl groups is affected by the redox treatments.8
Result	In the case of the sample treated to 1273 K in 10% H2, the first spectrum shows peaks at 184, 301, 470, 540 and 623 cm–1, which are also consistent with the presence of a t′ phase.
Background	This is an ordered defect structure, related to that of fluorite, with ⅛ of the anions missing.
Method	SR and SO were conducted at both 1173 K (A) and 1273 K (B).
Result	The most striking feature of this data set is that, for SR and SO at 1173 K (A), the procedure followed results in low temperature reduction with 10% H2 but not with 1% H2.
Result	Evidence is presented that the well-established phenomenon of promotion of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 reduction by suitable treatment procedures may be controlled by adjusting the conditions; and that such reduction leads to the formation of the pyrochlore structure at extremely low temperature.
Result	For SR and SO at 1273 K (B), low temperature reduction is observed with both H2 concentrations, but the effect is more pronounced with 10% H2, in the sense that the relative intensities of the two peaks observed indicate more uptake in the low temperature feature.
Result	At 623 K a weak peak appears at 295 cm–1, which becomes more intense and shifts to lower wavenumber as the temperature increases, while others appear at 380 and 495 cm–1.
Method	TPR-Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw Raman System 1000, with an Ar laser (514 nm, 25 mW) fitted with an in-situ cell that allows control of temperature and gas flow.
Result	It is important to underline the possibility of superimposed luminescence signals, derived from rare earth impurities at ppm levels, in these spectra.11
Problem	Promotion of reduction in Ce0.5Zr0.5O2: the pyrochlore structure as effect rather than cause?
Method	Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, BET surface area 40 m2 g–1 after calcination at 773 K (5 h), was prepared by a previously reported citrate route.8
Background	Correlation between structure and ease of reduction, which has received particular interest, remains an open question.
Background	The kinetics of the pyrochlore formation at high temperature has not been carefully studied.
Result	Similar analysis after subsequent SR (corresponding to 1A2 and 1B1)–MO showed only a small cell volume decrease from the SO-treated samples, suggesting that the procedures do not induce significant changes in the cation sub-lattice, at least on the XRD scale of detection (see ESI).
Background	The metastable nature of CZMOs with intermediate compositions has created difficulty in establishing certainties about the structure of such materials; which has generally complicated structural analysis of TPR behaviour.
Conclusion	These peaks are consistent with the formation of a pyrochlore phase.3
Background	Such a process would be difficult to observe given the detection limits of the techniques employed here.
Result	All show H2 uptake at relatively high temperature, the maximum of which depends on H2 concentration.
Conclusion	In summary, formation of a bulk pyrochloric structure, i.e. an ordered system, is not a necessary prerequisite to achieve promoted redox properties in Ce0.5Zr0.5O2.
Result	No Raman features could be observed at 1173 K and above due to the blackbody radiation, which overwhelms the Raman signal.
Result	Finally, the Raman spectra recorded after the CP, in Fig. 2 and at the start of TPR profile B1 (not shown) may all be assigned to t′.
Background	For CZMOs, they are generally reported to form under severe reducing conditions.5
Conclusion	Therefore, as suggested by an anonymous referee, it cannot be excluded that the pyrochlore nucleation process occurs in high temperature conditions (its rate being increased by increasing hydrogen pressure), while the growth process could occur with a significant rate at moderate temperatures.
Result	It is clear that the temperature at which the pyrochlore structure becomes visible (673 K, Fig. 2) is well above the start of the reduction profile (<500 K, Fig. 1B1′).
Conclusion	However, here we show that the effect is also strongly dependent on H2 concentration and temperature, in addition to the known dependence on the oxidation conditions (SO vs. MO).9
Background	Further studies are in progress in order to ascertain these aspects.
Background	The latter is an established TPR phenomenon.10
Background	The Ce1–xZrxO2 phase diagram2 may be summarised as follows: for x ≤ 0.15 a cubic, fluorite-type phase is formed, while for x ≥ 0.85, a monoclinic phase is present.
Result	For the sample treated to 1173 K in 1% H2 (Fig. 2A), the first spectrum shows peaks at 225, 306, 470, and 623 cm–1 which are consistent with the presence of a t′ phase.12
Result	Thus, reduction is not limited by H2 concentration.
Background	Despite this, the observation of promoted TPR profiles has recently been linked to a newly reported κ phase, formed by oxidation (873 K) of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 with the pyrochlore structure and destroyed by high temperature oxidation (1323 or 1423 K) to yield another new phase (t*).3,4
Background	The redox properties of ceria–zirconia mixed oxides (CZMOs) have been extensively investigated due to their use in automotive three-way catalysts (TWCs), in which CZMOs are included as the oxygen storage component.1
Result	This effect is reported in Fig. 1, which shows a series of TPR profiles obtained using 10 and 1% H2.
Result	Between 523 and 573 K, after commencement of sample reduction (Fig. 1B1′), peak intensities decrease strongly.
Result	Table 1 reports the degree of reduction for the eight TPR profiles of Fig. 1, as measured by O2 uptake during MO.
Background	At intermediate compositions, various phases (t, t′, t″, κ and t*) have been identified.2–4
Problem	Here we present evidence of formation of the pyrochlore phase during low temperature reduction.
Conclusion	Instead, we believe that a more complex situation than a simple structure–TPR relationship may be inferred for the TPR behaviour of this sample.
Problem	The formation of surface domains which promote reduction of the sample could instead offer an explanation.8
Method	After intermediate MO procedures, further TPR profiles (A1′, A2′, B1′ and B2′) were recorded.
Result	Cycling between the related profiles in Fig. 1B may be achieved by further SO and SR–MO treatments.
Result	Rietveld analysis of the XRD profile after SO at 1173 and 1273 K initially indicated that the structure may be fitted equally well using cubic (Fm3m) or tetragonal (P42/nmc) models.
Background	The pyrochlore was initially formed by high temperature reduction of a t′ phase.
Background	Oxygen deficient structures, such as the pyrochlore structure (A2B2X7), may also be formed.5
Method	Flow and ramp rates: 25 ml min–1 and 10 K min–1 respectively.
Result	It should be noted that the profile always remains on-scale with 1% H2.
Result	These Raman spectra offer a representative study of the TPR profiles A2′ and B1′ shown in Fig. 1.
Conclusion	On the other hand while the Raman technique proved to be sensitive in detecting the κ phase,13 no evidence for its presence was observed here.
Conclusion	Neither effect is observed with 1% H2, SR and SO 1173 K, thereby implying a link between promoted reduction and low temperature pyrochlore formation.
Result	Careful collection of XRD data revealed the presence of a low intensity characteristic t′ reflection (2θ = 42°).
Conclusion	Clearly, the preceding treatments have already conferred upon the sample the potential to undergo low temperature reduction, which in turn leads to very low temperature pyrochlore formation.
Method	Powder XRD spectra were collected on a Siemens Kristalloflex Mod.F (Ni-filtered Cu Kα).
Method	Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles (25 mg of sample) were recorded in a system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector: CP-O2 at 773 K (1 h), then cool, first to 423 K in O2, then to room temperature (rt) in Ar; TPR-H2 (10 or 1%) in Ar at rt (30 min), ramp to 1173 or 1273 K, hold 15 min, switch to Ar (15 min).
Result	In both cases, there was negligible change in the position and a small decrease in intensity of the peaks between rt and 473 K (first spectra shown).
Problem	Finally, after a TPR-Raman series corresponding to Fig 1B1, the sample was cooled to 700 K and spectra were measured before and after oxidation.
Problem	Here, we report evidence for the formation of a pyrochlore for Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 during low temperature reduction of the sample.
Method	Oxidation was performed in the same cell at the same temperatures as for TPR experiments.
Problem	The difference in experimental procedure (ramped vs. stepped temperature increase) should mean that, at a given temperature, the sample is more reduced during TPR-Raman than during TPR.
Background	In practice, pyrochlores are often not stoichiometric and are more correctly represented as A2B2X7+y.
Background	In addition, the existence of antiphase domain boundaries may further weaken the XRD peaks due to the κ phase.
Background	The intensity of such peaks strongly depends on factors such as temperature and environment, so great care must be taken when comparing spectra for structural analysis.
Method	Due to the different response to 1 and 10% H2, the profiles shown have been normalised to the total area detected.
Result	No evidence of the pyrochlore or related structures was found, indicating that the pyrochlore was not formed at high temperature during the previous TPR.
Result	As the reduction temperature increases, the peak intensities decrease, until, at temperatures corresponding to complete reduction of the sample (Fig. 1A2′), a featureless spectrum is observed.
Background	Current interest in the pyrochlore structure in CZMOs is strong as its formation has been suggested to enhance oxygen storage behaviour.3,4,6,7
Result	Comparable and high degrees of reduction were achieved in all experiments suggesting that formation of pyrochlore should be equally favoured.
Method	Profiles A1, A2, B1 and B2 were obtained after: SR–MO–SR–SO.
Method	Reduction was performed by introducing the reducing gas (1 or 10% H2 in Ar), heating in a stepwise manner (50 K intervals) and recording the spectra during the isothermal steps (15 min).
Result	Fig. 2 shows two series of in-situ TPR-Raman spectra obtained during reduction of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 using 1% H2 (A) and 10% H2 (B).
Conclusion	We find no clear correlation between the appearance of the Raman spectra and reduction profile (or formation of pyrochlore), although it must be reiterated that the possible presence of impurity peaks makes identification of any such correlation difficult.
Conclusion	Once formed superficially at high temperature, a very thin pyrochlore layer (the nuclei) could be transformed into the κ phase under mild conditions, which in turn gives the pyrochlore structure (as in Fig. 2b) at low temperature, first on the surface then inwards of the particle (growth process).
Method	An in-situ cleaning procedure (CP) was applied before each set of experiments.

Result	The strain and the relaxation are found to contribute equally to the large red shift of the emitted light.
Result	This, and the fact that the absorption and the emission energies are in close agreement with experimental data indicate that the potential-energy curve of the excited state does not possess any outer minimum.
Method	In order to check whether the excited state has an outer potential minimum trapping an exciton state at the surface of the Si cluster, the optimization of the molecular structure of the first excited state was performed without any symmetry constraints i.e. in C1 symmetry starting from a structure with a long Si(3)–Si(5) distance of 3.18 Å.
Conclusion	Fig. 4 shows that energy shift due to the relaxation of the excited state is equally significant to the red shift as the strain-energy contribution of the ground state.
Result	In the first three columns, the excitation energy and oscillator strengths obtained using the Td structure of the ground state are given, while the remaining columns contain the corresponding data obtained using the optimized D2d structure of the first excited state.
Result	The potential-energy curves for the ground and excited states along the same trajectory are shown in Fig. 4.
Background	The large red shift of the luminescence has been explained by localized surface states in the Si nanocluster.15
Background	They found that the ground state has an all-confining single well, whereas the excited state has a double-well potential.
Result	The molecular structure of the ground state of the Si29H36 cluster belongs to the Td point group, whereas the symmetry of the first excited state was found to be D2d.
Result	Thus, the wavelength of the emitted light is 396 nm; blue light is emitted as also detected experimentally.1–9
Problem	The potential-energy curve for a relaxation pathway of the first excited state of the Si29H36 cluster has also been investigated.
Background	Experimental and computational studies suggested that the Si nanoparticles most likely consist of 29 Si atoms which is a magic number for approximately spherically shaped clusters of Td symmetry.
Conclusion	Instead, the small structural changes due to the relaxation of the excited state result in a lower energy for the excited state and simultaneously the energy of the ground state increases significantily due to the strain.
Method	However, as a first guess one can assume that in the relaxation process the internal coordinates change linearly between the two extremes.
Result	The calculated wavelength of the emitted light is 396 nm which agrees well with experiment as the silicon cluster emits blue light.
Result	In Table 2, the excitation energies of the first few dipole-allowed excitations are given.
Result	The potential-energy curves for both states are smooth functions with one single minimum each.
Conclusion	The present calculations thus show that it is most unlikely that the potential-energy curve of the excited state has two minima separated by a barrier as previously suggested by Allan et al.15
Background	Based on empirical tight-binding and first-principle local-density calculations, Allan et al15. proposed that such states exist under the form of self-trapped excitons at the Si–Si dimers on the nanocluster surface.
Background	The calculations also showed that the silicon cluster of 1 nm size possesses a band structure consisting of more than one hundred excited states below the ionization threshold at about 8 eV.14
Method	As the emission spectrum is also constructed from calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths, not all contributions to the emission are taken into account.27
Result	The excitation energy plot shown in Fig. 3 is obtained from such an interpolation procedure.
Background	Spectroscopic studies showed that the Si cluster is covered by hydrogens.
Background	However, the ground-state structure is not necessarily optimal for the excited state resulting in a relaxation of the molecular structure of the excited state.
Problem	The corresponding emission spectrum as well as the absorption spectrum for the ground-state structure have been studied by employing TDDFT calculations.
Background	This simplified absorption-emission mechanism suggests that the emitted light is red shifted as compared to the absorbed one.
Result	Small structural changes caused by the relaxation of the excited state introduce strains in the ground-state structure.
Result	Si(2) is attached to Si(1), which is the central Si atom, and to Si(4) which is a surface Si atom with only one attached hydrogen.
Result	However, the absence of a potential threshold along this trajectory for the excited state shows that the molecular structure of the excited state is, after excitation, relaxed without any barrier.
Result	In Table I, one can see that the changes in the bond lengths are rather small.
Background	Calculations at the CC2 level and DFT calculations using a hybrid functional yielded somewhat larger excitation energies, whereas calculations at the coupled-cluster singles (CCS)14 and the closely related configuration-interaction singles (CIS) levels6–8 yielded an excitation threshold of about 6 eV.
Conclusion	The chosen trajectory is not necessarily the exact pathway of the relaxation process.
Problem	Density functional studies of the luminescence of Si29H36
Conclusion	Thus, the present calculations do not support the notion that the potential-energy surface of the excited state has a double-well structure.
Background	In photophysical studies of ultrasmall nano-sized Si particles, Nayfeh et al1–11. found that the absorption occurs in the ultra-violet (UV) region, whereas the excited Si particles emitted blue light with such a high intensity that one was able to observe the individual particles.
Result	The changes in the bond lengths are remarkably small especially when one considers that the difference between the absorption and emission energies is as large as 0.72 eV.
Result	The largest difference of 2.1 pm is obtained for the Si(2)–Si(4) bond.
Result	As seen in the figure, the excitation energy is a smooth function decreasing from 3.85 eV for the ground-state structure and reaching 3.14 eV for the fully optimized structure of the excited state.
Result	The electronic absorption and emission energies for the fully optimized molecular structures have been calculated at the TDDFT level.
Background	The deexcitation giving rise to the luminescence can probably be considered to occur vertically from the relaxed excited state structure.
Result	By optimizing the doubly degenerate 1e state one obtains a higher luminescence energy of about 3.5 eV, whereas for symmetry reasons, the three individual components of the 1t2 state are identical.
Background	A more detailed understanding of light absorption and light emission processes requires information about the potential-energy surfaces of both the ground and the involved excited states.
Background	At the DFT level using the Becke–Perdew (BP) functional, the excitation energy of the first excited state is 3.85 eV which agrees well with the experimental excitation threshold of 3.7 eV.
Conclusion	These two contributions seem to be equally responsible for the obtained luminescence shift of 0.72 eV.
Result	When the molecular structure of the Si cluster in the first excited state is assumed to belong to the Td point group, the luminescence energy is red shifted by 0.26 eV as compared to the absorption threshold, while when the cluster is allowed to relax to a D2d structure, the energy decreases by 0.72 eV yielding a deexcitation energy of 3.14 eV.
Method	The relaxation pathway between the molecular structures of the ground and first excited states is difficult to compute.
Result	The absorption and emission spectra obtained using the data of Table 2 are displayed in Fig. 2.
Method	The molecular structure of the first excited state was fully optimized at the BP TDDFT level using the Egrad module of Turbomole.25,26
Result	The molecular structures of the ground and the lowest excited state of a Si29H36 cluster have been optimized at the density-functional-theory (DFT) level using the time-dependent perturbation-theory (TDDFT) approach for the excited state.
Background	The electronic absorption spectrum up to the ionization threshold has recently been calculated for the Si cluster at density-functional-theory (DFT) levels and the accuracy of the obtained excitation energies were checked using coupled-cluster response-theory (CC2) calculations.14
Method	Structure optimizations were performed at the density-functional-theory (DFT) level18 using a gradient-corrected local-density approximation (BP)19–21 and triple-zeta valence quality basis sets augmented with polarization functions (TZVP).22
Background	Experimentally, the excited Si cluster is found to emit blue light which corresponds to an excitation energy of about 3 eV.
Result	However, no outer potential minimum could be found in the reoptimization of the first excited state.
Result	No avoiding crossing yielding double minima of the potential-energy surface of the excited state, as previously proposed, can be seen in the figure.
Method	The molecular structure of the Si29H36 cluster was optimized in the ground and the first excited state using the Turbomole program.17
Method	For the luminescence spectrum, the molecular structure of the 1b2 state has been assumed.
Result	The calculations show that there are two equal sources to the huge red shift: the relaxation of the excited state and the energy shift due to the strain of the ground state.
Problem	In this work, the molecular structure of the first excited state of the Si29H36 cluster has been fully optimized at the time-dependent density-functional-theory (TDDFT) level.
Result	See Fig. 1 for the atom numbering.
Background	Thus, the relaxation of the excited state leads to a huge shift of about 0.7 eV.
Result	The molecular structure of the Si29H36 cluster is shown in Fig. 1, and the bond lengths of the ground and excited states are given in Table I. Structure changes (ΔR) due to the relaxation of the excited state are also given in the table.
Background	Si particles with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen termination have also been prepared5,8 and studied computationally.12,13
Background	The inner minimum corresponds to a normal nonradiative delocalized excited state with a Si–Si distance of the surface dimer of 2.35 Å, while the outer minimum corresponds to a radiative and trapped excitonic surface state with a Si–Si interspacing of 3.85 Å.1,16
Background	Previous calculations showed that at least TZVP basis sets have to be used in order to obtain an accurate excitation spectrum.14
Result	The bonds to the central Si(1) become 1.1 pm longer than for the ground state, while when the Td symmetry is enforced on the excited state, the Si(1)–Si(2) bond becomes 3.3 pm longer than for the ground state.
Method	The absorption and emission spectra were calculated using the time-dependent perturbation-theory approach (TDDFT).23,24
Result	The excitation energy calculated for the equilibrium structure of the excited state using the Becke–Perdew (BP) functional was found to be 0.72 eV smaller than the vertical excitation energy for the ground-state structure.
Method	Population of higher excited states leads to other molecular structures and different luminescence spectra.
Background	Nayfeh et al1. adopted their notion and examined various photoexcitation pathways involved in accessing and populating these molecular states.1
Background	At absorption, the molecular system is excited from the ground state in its equilibrium geometry to an excited state and during the excitation process the molecular structure is approximately unchanged; the excitation is usually thought to be vertical.

Result	Recall that the intensity of the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band is ca. 103 times weaker than the 2–0 band when using a He-carrier gas with a backing pressure of 14.8 bar and at xd−1 = 10.7.
Method	The rotational contour of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 LIF band was fit using known spectroscopic constants22,23 in order to determine the Boltzmann rotational temperature representative of the I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) ground state level, Trot, in each set of experiments.
Background	Subsequent papers have suggested, however, that resonances need not be invoked to explain the large cross sections.8–10,12
Background	A fundamental goal of reaction dynamicists is to develop an understanding of a bimolecular encounter on the state-to-state level.
Result	The intensities of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 bands decay monotonically with increasing distance with the 3–0 band decaying more rapidly than the 2–0 band.
Method	The Lennard-Jones 6–12 model is especially convenient because the collision frequency, ZLJ, can be related to the hard sphere collision frequency, ZHS, using published Ω(2,2)* collision integrals: ZLJ = Ω(2,2)*ZHSThe collision integrals have been tabulated as a function of the reduced temperature, T*, whereT* = kT/εand ε corresponds to the well depth of the potential.
Conclusion	The amount of energy found in the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) and I35Cl(B,v′ = 1), Δv = −1 vibrational relaxation channels represents ca. 6% of the total available energy.
Problem	Having observed that the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band is detected as a result of collision-induced vibrational relaxation with He atoms in the expansion, we sought to characterize the full-collision dynamical process by examining the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2,j′) rotational product-state distribution.
Result	While both of these vibrational predissociation product-state distributions bear some resemblance to those of the collision-induced product-state distribution, Fig. 5a, the distribution formed from the vibrational predissociation of the n′ = 0, J′ = 0 level is quantitatively more similar.
Background	The assumption that Ttot = TAB will be qualitatively justified in the following section.
Result	Of these three collision partners, Ne is observed to have the smallest probability for inducing vibrational relaxation even though the excited-state binding energy of I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) with Ne is significantly larger than that with He and comparable to that with H2.
Conclusion	While several approximations and assumptions were made in extracting these cross sections, the large values are suggestive of the significant probability for vibrational relaxation of ICl(B,v′ = 3) rotor states induced by collisions with He atoms in the supersonic expansion.
Method	These experiments were performed in a similar manner as reported previously.16–18,21
Method	The intensity of the I35Cl E → X, 11 → v″ fluorescence induced by the probe laser was then monitored as a function of the temporal delay between the pump and probe lasers.
Conclusion	Because of the strong possibility that Ne⋯ICl(B,v′ = 3) van der Waals complexes undergo electronic predissociation, we find it plausible that collisions between Ne atoms and ICl(B,v′ = 3) excited-state molecules can induce non-adiabatic dissociation of ICl via the repulsive Z1 state.
Method	The spectra were taken using a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar, and at a downstream distance of xd−1 = 11.2.
Conclusion	This suggests that at low temperatures, the He atoms are steered toward the minimum of the He + ICl(B,v′ = 3) intermolecular potential before scattering off the repulsive wall.
Method	Rather than attempting to incorporate each of the temperatures in estimating ZHS, we have chosen to use Ttot = Trot + Tslip for TAB and ρ for ρB in eqn (3) to provide an upper limit for ZHS.
Result	Minima were observed at j′ = 8 and 10 for the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) and I35Cl(B,v′ = 1) products, respectively.
Result	To higher energy than the monomer bands are spectroscopic features attributed to transitions of He⋯I35,37Cl complexes with T-shaped and linear equilibrium orientations in the ground state to different intermolecular vibrational levels in the excited state.16,18,24
Result	The measurement was repeated with the pump laser set at 21.7 mm downstream, xd−1 = 24.4, and with backing pressures of 7.9 and 14.8 bar, and the same velocity was obtained in all measurements.
Problem	It is interesting to compare the results of the full-collision dynamics with those of the recently reported half-collision, vibrational predissociation dynamics of He⋯I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) van der Waals complexes prepared with varying amounts of intermolecular vibrational excitation.20
Result	The error bars were estimated using the signal-to-noise levels of the LIF features.
Conclusion	The intensity of the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band also increases with He-backing pressure and tracks roughly with the collision frequency of ICl molecules with He atoms in the expansion.
Result	The values of Trot were found to change only slightly with increasing backing pressure throughout this pressure range, varying from 1.36(3) to 1.49(3) K. The I35Cl–He collision frequency, which should be approximately proportional to the I35Cl*–He collision frequency, was calculated using eqns (1), (3), and (4) and assuming TAB is equal to either Trot or Ttot at each pressure.
Conclusion	A possible explanation for this behavior may be that in colliding with the ICl molecule at the low temperatures achieved in the expansion, the He atom is steered by the He + ICl(B,v′ = 3) potential where it tends to find the region of the minimum of the multi-dimensional PES, which is also where the lowest bound intermolecular vibrational level is localized.
Method	The probe laser was aligned so that it crossed the expansion 3.5(1) mm downstream from the pump laser.
Method	In addition, the mechanical opening of the solenoid pulsed valve varied slightly on a day-to-day basis and, as a result, the pulsed valve widths and the temporal delay between the opening of pulsed valve and the firing of the laser were optimized for each set of experiments.
Background	In our group’s work on the Ne⋯ICl complex,53 we noted that the signals observed in the ICl B–X, 2–0 region were larger than the signals observed in the 3–0 region.
Result	When more highly excited intermolecular vibrational levels are prepared, however, the bimodal structure blurs out.
Result	The resultant estimates of ρI35Cl vary from 1.0 × 1014 cm−3 at xd−1 = 5.8 down to 1.6 × 1013 cm−3 at xd−1 = 14.0, as shown in Fig. 3 as open squares.
Background	A recent publication on He⋯ICl has shown that excitation to these different intermolecular vibrational levels gives rise to different vibrational predissociation dynamics due in large part to the region of the intermolecular potential that is populated.20
Conclusion	Consequently, we can only deduce an upper limit for the velocity slip between the I35Cl molecules and the He atoms of 60 m s−1.
Result	However, because our integration gate is delayed 150 ns after the laser, I35,37Cl B → X, 3 → v″ fluorescence is not detected.
Result	The calculated total densities range from 3.8 × 1017 cm−3 at xd−1 = 5.8 down to 0.6 × 1017 cm−3 at xd−1 = 14.0.
Method	The rates, k3–2, can be approximated using the f3–2 values at each distance and the I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) excited-state lifetime.
Result	The integrated intensity of the 2–0 band is 30.4 on this intensity scale, and we would expect the 3–0 band to have an integrated intensity of 91.2 on the same scale if the v′ = 3 rotational states were not predissociative.
Background	Because of this, the debate is still considered by some to be open.
Method	The local temperatures associated with each xd−1 at which LIF spectra were recorded are calculated using eqn (2).
Problem	A combination of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and two-color, pump–probe experiments are performed in conjunction with a systematic interrogation of the spectra recorded using different expansion conditions to shed light on these energy transfer processes.
Method	Weighted fits of the data to power dependencies were made to provide a guide for the experimental trends of the intensities, shown as solid lines.
Conclusion	This velocity would correspond to Tslip < 0.6 K, suggesting that Tslip may be either within or below the range of Trot, 0.19 to 3.0 K. Consequently, we do include Tslip in some of the analyses described below to investigate what contribution the velocity slip may have on the observed dynamics.
Method	We assume that the contribution of the spontaneous emission of ICl(B,v′ = 3) is negligible.
Background	Because of the low temperatures, a potential incorporating an attractive term gives much more reasonable estimates of collision frequencies.
Result	By thoroughly characterizing the expansion properties, we observe that collisions of ICl(B, v′ = 3) molecules with He atoms in the expansion induce vibrational relaxation of the initially prepared dihalogen down to rotor states in the next lower ICl(B,v′ = 2) level on timescales that compete with the rate for non-adiabatic transfer from the B state to the Z1 state.
Method	The relative temperature between A and B is TAB, the local density of B within the expansion is ρB, the reduced mass of the collision pair is μAB, and k is Bolzmann’s constant.
Background	Previously reported pump–probe experiments indicate that the I35,37Cl B–X, 3–0 LIF features are observed as a result of a mechanism that populates rotational states of the long-lived I35,37Cl(B,v′ = 2) vibrational level following the preparation of rotor states in the short-lived I35,37Cl(B,v′ = 3) level.25
Method	The data points and the fits were normalized by dividing each data point by the value of the fit at xd−1 = 5.8.
Method	The ICl/carrier gas mixture was pulsed through an orifice with a diameter, d, of 890(30) μm at 10 Hz into a vacuum chamber maintained at pressures <2.7 × 10−5 bar during an experiment using a roots blower mechanical pumping system.
Conclusion	This indicates that some other phenomenon must be giving rise to the observed trends.
Background	A special subset of the experiments examining the collisional-relaxation dynamics of halogen molecules with rare gas atoms involves dissociation of rare gas–dihalogen van der Waals complexes, Rg⋯XY.
Method	Since the energy difference between the I35Cl(B,v′ = 3,j′ = 0) and I35Cl(B,v′ = 2,j′ = 0) states and the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2,j′ = 0) and I35Cl(B,v′ = 1,j′ = 0) states is 163.4 and 182.7 cm−1, respectively,22 we can estimate the fraction of the available energy that is found in rotational excitation of the products.
Background	The values of the collision integrals in ref. 48 only extend to T* = 0.3; however, lower values of T* have been reported by Knight and co-workers.39
Problem	The experiments that are described in this manuscript were undertaken to identify the relaxation dynamics induced by collisions of a He carrier gas with ICl excited in the B–X spectral region within a supersonic expansion.
Conclusion	Hence, similar rotational product-state distributions are observed.
Background	Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been undertaken to characterize the properties of atoms and molecules within isentropic supersonic expansions.31–35
Conclusion	The resulting ICl(B,v′ = 2,j′) product rotational distribution, along with the analogous ICl(B,v′ = 1,j′) distribution formed by collisional relaxation of molecules in the long-lived ICl(B,v′ = 2) level are compared to ICl(B,v′ = 2,j′) products formed by vibrational predissociation of He⋯ICl complexes prepared in different intermolecular vibrational levels within the He + ICl(B,v′ = 3) potential.
Conclusion	Thus, we do not include effects from the velocity distribution in the analyses below.
Result	The intensities of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 band are found to be proportional to the density of the ground-state I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) molecules at each distance, ρI35Cl, calculated as described in Section III. b.
Result	In contrast, the intensity of the 3–0 band is significantly smaller, ca. 106 times weaker, than the 2–0 when using a 90% Ne in He carrier gas at the same backing pressure and distance.
Problem	Vibrational relaxation dynamics of I35Cl(B, v′) induced by low-temperature collisions with He atoms
Result	The different values of the temperatures within the expansion, Tcalc, Trot, and Tslip, indicate the complexity of fully characterizing the properties of an expansion comprised of multiple species.
Result	Since the fluorescence following excitation of the 3–0 band is from the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) level, we can directly compare the value of 91.2 to the integrated intensity of the 3–0 band, 0.12, and we find that f3–2 ≈ 1.3 × 10−3 at xd−1 = 11.2 and with a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar.
Conclusion	Within the experimental error, this value is the same as both the terminal velocity of pure He in a supersonic expansion, 1760 m s−1,38 and the mass weighted terminal velocity of 360 ppm ICl in a He expansion, 1747 m s−1.
Background	Recent work by our group, however, has shown that different conformers of Rg⋯XY complexes can be stabilized within a supersonic expansion.16–19
Method	The difference in the velocities along the expansion direction results from the different masses of the species and is referred to as a velocity slip, with the heavier species travelling more slowly than the lighter species.
Conclusion	The rotational-state distributions of the low-energy, collision-induced vibrational relaxation and of the vibrational predissociation from low-lying He⋯ICl(B,v′) intermolecular vibrational levels are seen to match quite well as opposed to the agreement with the distributions from the vibrational predissociation of levels that have more intermolecular vibrational excitation and are delocalized in the angular coordinate.
Background	Since then, a debate has ensued over the role that orbiting resonances, or weakly-bound collision complexes, have in the collisional relaxation of I2(B,v′).
Result	The values of σ3–2 as well as f3–2, and k3–2 at each xd−1 are listed in Table 1.
Background	An initial report suggested that orbiting resonances were the primary contributor to the large vibrational relaxation cross sections observed.7
Problem	The collision-induced vibrational relaxation of ICl* molecules should be proportional to the product of the He-atom carrier gas density and the ICl*–He collision frequency, as mentioned above.
Method	The bandwidth was 0.06 cm−1, and neutral density filters were used to lower the laser pulse energies so that saturation effects were minimized; we found that pulse energies as low as 30 μJ were needed to avoid saturating individual rotational lines in the strong ICl E–B, v†–v′ product spectra.
Result	Using our observed upper limit for the slip temperature for the He calculations and assuming no slip for the Ne calculations, the worst case scenario, we find that there is a factor of 2.5 more collisions in the Ne expansion than in the He expansion.
Result	The collision frequency between molecules prepared in the short-lived I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) level and the He atoms is high enough that vibrational relaxation down to rotational states in the next lower I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) level can occur with measurable yields.
Method	This is critical since Trot is dependent on the precise expansion conditions utilized, specifically the downstream distance that the laser crosses the expansion17 and, to a lesser extent, the backing pressure of the carrier gas.
Result	The spectrum recorded in the ICl B–X, 2–0 region was reported previously in Fig. 1 of ref. 20 but is plotted again in Fig. 1a for clarity of the discussion in these studies.
Method	Since Trot is the most reliable measurement of the expansion temperature for our current apparatus, and Trot is known to be an upper limit for the equilibrium temperature, Teq,40Trot is used in eqn (1) to approximate the total density (He atoms and ICl molecules) ρ at each distance in the expansion.
Background	Presumably, this is because until recently the dynamics of Rg⋯XY complexes were only observed from one geometry, that of the T-shaped intermolecular orientation.13,14
Conclusion	This mechanism would compete with vibrational relaxation and thereby reduce the observed yields for the collisional-relaxation products.
Method	Regions with different local temperatures within the expansion, as well as varying densities and collision frequencies, were sampled by adjusting the downstream distance at which the laser axis intersected the supersonic expansion; most of these experiments were performed at downstream distances, x, ranging from 5.0 to 25.0 mm, or xd−1 = 5.6 to 28.1.
Problem	The ICl molecules in a He expansion are thus predicted to be travelling slower than the lighter He atoms, and collisions between the two species will occur with a temperature of Tslip.
Method	These measurements are used to estimate the physical parameters associated with the collisions of He atoms with ICl(B,v′ = 3,j′) molecules that compete with the non-adiabatic dissociation dynamics of the excited-state molecules.
Result	The highest observed rotor lines are the P(21) and the P(23) lines in the 10–2 and 9–1 spectra, respectively.
Result	The frequency resolution of the dye laser was measured to be 0.06–0.07 cm−1.
Result	These features, therefore, cannot be attributed to transitions originating from bound He⋯I35,37Cl(X,v″ = 0) intermolecular vibrational levels or from weakly interacting He + I35,37Cl(X,v″ = 0) collision complexes that would have different rotational contours than those observed.
Background	Experimentally, the dynamics are simplified within a supersonic expansion in which low temperatures, and consequently small initial-state distributions, are easily attainable.
Problem	Finally, a comparison of the full-collision measurements with half-collision dynamics of He⋯ICl(B,v′ = 3) complexes will be made.
Result	There is poor agreement between the values of Tcalc and Trot, especially at low xd−1, as Tcalc is more than a factor of two greater than Trot up to xd−1 = 14.0.
Conclusion	We believe that these spectra are of the nascent product-state distributions since pump–probe spectra were recorded at two extreme distances downstream, 5 mm and 20 mm, and therefore in regions with different collision frequencies, and no significant changes in the rotational distributions were observed.
Method	The rotational-state distributions of the Δv = −1 vibrational relaxation channels were determined using a linear least-squares fitting algorithm, known spectroscopic constants,22,50 and the appropriate rotational linestrength factors51 to fit the rotational contours.
Result	The spectrum of the I35Cl E–B, 9–1 band recorded with the pump laser fixed on the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 bandhead, which also corresponds to excitation of the j′ = 1–3 rotor levels, is plotted in Fig. 4b for comparison.
Result	This indicates that the Lennard-Jones potential is a slightly better model for calculating collision frequencies than the simplistic hard-sphere potential.
Result	Using laser-induced fluorescence and two-laser, pump–probe spectroscopy, collision-induced vibrational relaxation is observed to compete with the dissociation of electronically excited ICl in a helium carrier gas expansion.
Method	The pump laser was fixed at the wavelength of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 bandhead, at 17 664 cm−1, and the probe laser was fixed on the I35Cl E–B, 11–2 bandhead, 23 066 cm−1.
Problem	Using the aforementioned equations for density and collision frequency, eqns (1), (3), and (4), as well as the characterization of the temperature of the expansion, we can model the downstream-distance and backing-pressure dependences of the intensities of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 features in an attempt to gain insight into the collision dynamics that give rise to the observed signals.
Background	While this is particularly true for reactive systems, insights into the dynamics and mechanisms guiding energy transfer in non-reactive partners are also desirable.
Result	The weak features near 17 821 and 17 828 cm−1 correspond to transitions of the I37,35Cl(X,v″ = 0) monomers to the short-lived I37,35Cl(B,v′ = 3,j′) rotational states.26,27
Background	Based upon previous experimental investigations, the low ICl(B,v′ = 3,j′) rotor states accessed in these transitions have lifetimes on the order of 0.5 ns due to the presence of a nearby repulsive curve, the Z 1 state.27–30
Problem	We have also monitored the dependence of the intensities of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 LIF bands as a function of He-backing pressure; LIF spectra in each vibronic region were recorded at xd−1 = 10.7 nozzle diameters using various He-backing pressures between 11.4 and 28.6 bar.
Result	Vibrational predissociation from the n′ = 4,J′ = 1 level is better in this respect, but lacks a definitive bimodal distribution as well as non-negligible population at Erot > 20 cm−1.
Background	Similar behavior has been reported for a He/I2 expansion using a slit nozzle.3
Result	The maximum probe signal was observed at a temporal delay of 2.00 μs with the pump laser crossing the expansion 9.9 mm downstream from the pulsed valve orifice, xd−1 = 11.1, when using a backing pressure of 14.8 bar.
Method	Recall that since we have monitored the intensity of the fluorescence signal using a boxcar integration gate positioned 150 ns after the excitation laser pulse, we detect fluorescence from only those excited-state molecules that undergo collisions and not from a vast majority of the prepared molecules that non-adiabatically dissociate.
Background	This was attributed to the competition between electronic predissociation and vibrational predissociation that is present in the 3–0 region due to the presence of the nearby repulsive ICl(Z 1) electronic state.26
Background	The ICl(B,v′ = 2) rotational populations that result following the preparation of complexes in the metastable He⋯ICl(B,v′ = 3,n′ = 0,J′ = 0) and He⋯ICl(B,v′ = 3, n′ = 4, J′ = 1) states are shown as black diamonds and open triangles, respectively.
Method	A dichroic mirror was used to co-propagate the pump and probe laser beams through the expansion region.
Method	Also, the dynamics of the full-collision events are conveniently compared to those of the half-collision dynamics that were recently reported for vibrational predissociation of He⋯ICl van der Waals complexes from varying energy regions within the He + ICl(B,v′ = 3) intermolecular potential energy surface (PES)20.
Method	The full-collision data can be analyzed to determine whether evidence exists for resonance-enhanced cross sections for collisions of ICl with He at low temperatures.
Conclusion	The values of σ3–2 are in the range of 20–50 Å2 under these conditions and are comparable to the hard-sphere scattering cross section of 43 Å2 obtained using dHe(ICl) = 3.7 Å.
Method	Slight deviations in the I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) rotational temperatures were found with these timing changes even when all other conditions were kept constant.
Result	The rotationally resolved spectrum of the I35Cl E–B, 10–2 band recorded with the pump laser fixed on the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 bandhead, which corresponds to excitation of the j′ = 1–3 rotor levels, is shown in Fig. 4a.
Method	Fluorescence was detected by imaging the interaction region of the laser with the expansion onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) via a mirror and telescope assembly.
Result	Collision-induced vibrational relaxation results in a bimodal I35Cl(B,v′ − 1) rotational state distribution with maxima at j′ = 6 and 12 and a minimum at j′ = 8 or 10, Fig. 5a.
Method	Furthermore, each species in the expansion will have a different velocity distribution, which can be characterized by a translational temperature, Ttrans.
Problem	Pathways that compete with the non-adiabatic dissociation of electronically excited ICl(B,v′ = 3) in a He-carrier gas expansion are investigated using LIF and two-laser, pump–probe spectroscopy.
Problem	This distribution could then be compared to the recently published He⋯ICl half-collision data20 in an effort to understand the relationships, if any, between the two processes.
Problem	We have recorded LIF spectra of ICl entrained in a number of different carrier gases to qualitatively check for the effect of the collision partner on the vibrational relaxation of ICl(B,v′ = 3).
Result	The distributions obtained from the I35Cl E–B, 10–2 and 9–1 bands, Fig. 4a and b, are plotted as a function of I35Cl(B,v′) internal rotational energy in Fig. 5a as black circles and open squares, respectively.
Method	In order to calculate k3–2, we use f3–2 to determine the relative yields of the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) and I 2P3/2 + Cl 2P3/2 products that result from collisional relaxation and non-adiabatic dissociation, respectively.
Result	The mean rotational energy found in each of these product levels is 9.5 and 10.9 cm−1.
Result	As will be shown below, the general trend observed of decreasing I35Cl density as a function of xd−1 is reproduced using Trot in eqn (1).
Result	The intensities of the ICl B–X, 3–0 features in these ICl/H2 spectra are about twice those measured in the helium expansion.
Background	With this goal in mind, groups have undertaken investigations into the collision dynamics of several systems, some of which include rare-gas atoms with halogen molecules, especially helium atoms with molecular iodine, I2.1–12
Method	One such model that has worked well is the Lennard-Jones 6–12 potential.8,39,45–47
Problem	In order to best characterize the dynamics and mechanism of the collision processes occurring in the expansion, special attention was focused on characterizing the local environment within the supersonic expansion and on tracking the experimental observables as a function of the expansion conditions.
Background	These papers do acknowledge, however, that even though resonances are not required to explain the results, they could still be contributing to the observed behavior.
Background	Thus, we propose an alternative possibility.
Method	The simplistic equation for collisions between hard spheres43 is most often implemented to estimate order-of-magnitude collision frequencies of a molecule A with carrier gas atoms B:ZHS = πd2AB (8kTAB/πμAB)1/2ρBThe collision diameter dAB is taken to be the average of the diameters of A and B, dAB = ½(dA + dB).
Method	These spectra were recorded using a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar, at xd−1 = 11.9, and with the same laser pulse energies and PMT settings so that the relative intensities of the spectral features observed in both spectra can be compared.
Method	It is also important to emphasize that the rotational structure indicates that bare I35Cl molecules are being promoted to rotational states within the I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) level, not He⋯I35Cl complexes that would form I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) products via vibrational predissociation of metastable He⋯I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) intermolecular vibrational levels.
Result	These temperatures, Tcalc, are shown in Fig. 2 as open squares, as are the I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) Boltzmann rotational temperatures Trot, that were experimentally determined by fitting the rotational contour of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 LIF band, black squares.
Background	The intermolecular potential energy surfaces for He + ICl(B,v′ = 3), Ne + ICl(B,v′ = 3), and ortho-H2 + ICl(B,v′ = 3) have all been shown to have minima in the T-shaped orientation with binding energies of 16.2(7),52 65(5),53 and 69.5(3)–76.3(3) cm−1,54 respectively.
Result	2, and, as a result, we use the intensity of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 band to monitor changes in the I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) ground-state density.
Result	A fit of the experimental data indicates that the functional form of eqn (2) is appropriate only with a larger value for the constant A, 5.28(5), black line in Fig. 2.
Result	The main difference is that in the collisional-relaxation data the two maxima have comparable populations, while vibrational predissociation from the n′ = 0, J′ = 0 level has the first maxima with significantly more population.
Method	High-resolution LIF spectra of ICl entrained in a He supersonic expansion were recorded in the ICl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 spectral regions, Fig. 1a and b, respectively.
Method	A commercial dye laser, pumped by the 532 nm output of a 10 Hz, Nd:YAG laser, was used in LIF spectroscopy experiments.
Result	The agreement of ZHS*ρI35Cl with the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band is reasonable but not quite as good as the agreement with ZLJ*ρI35Cl.
Method	The densities of the ground state I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) molecules ρI35Cl are then estimated by multiplying ρ by the partial pressure of ICl in a He carrier gas, ca. 360 ppm at 14.8 bar and 274 K,41 and by the isotopic abundance of the I35Cl isotope, 0..757742
Background	The dissociation of these complexes is often thought of as a half-collision event because it mimics the second half of a collision that occurs at a specified intermolecular geometry.
Result	This spectrum is dominated by the I37Cl and I35Cl monomer bands near 17 659 and 17 664 cm−1, respectively.
Method	The distribution of the lighter species is broader than that of the heavier species, which will also contribute to the slip between the light and heavy species in the expansion.
Method	We take the Lennard-Jones well depth, ε, to be equal to that of the calculated He + ICl(B,v′ = 3) PES, 32 cm−1 in the T-shaped orientation;18 the potential will be more shallow at other collision geometries.
Method	The pulsed valve and the supply lines, except for the sample reservoir, were kept at room temperature, ca. 294 K. The collision frequencies and densities in the expansion region were varied by utilizing different carrier-gas backing pressures within the range of 3.8 to 28.6 bar.
Background	However, while numerous papers have been published on the dissociation dynamics of Rg⋯XY van der Waals complexes both by experimentalists and theoreticians,14,15 surprisingly little effort has been spent connecting the half-collision and full-collision regimes.
Method	The larger rotor constant of ICl in comparison to that of I2 permits rotational populations to be accurately determined.
Result	Furthermore, the effectiveness of both of these potentials in modeling collision frequencies eliminates the necessity of invoking a resonance enhancement to the collision cross section.
Conclusion	Furthermore, because of the relatively large mass and polarizability of Ne compared to H2 or He, collision-induced non-adiabatic dissociation should be much more prevalent with a Ne carrier gas than with H2 or He.
Method	The current signal from the PMT was amplified, integrated and averaged with a boxcar-gated integrator, and recorded as a function of laser wavelength.
Result	The temporal breadth of the pump–probe signals in all the measurements was approximately the same, ca. 0.22 μs, and appears to be limited by the diameters of the focused lasers in the expansion region.
Result	Strong agreement between the integrated intensity of the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band, filled circles, and ZLJ*ρI35Cl, open circles, is observed in Fig. 3.
Conclusion	The different efficiencies for vibrational relaxation with the He, Ne, Ar, and H2 collision partners do not appear to be a result of the corresponding attractive intermolecular potential wells in the excited state.
Conclusion	Our estimates of the vibrational relaxation cross sections of ICl(B,v′ = 3), 20–50 Å2, are in accord with the reported cross sections for vibrational relaxation of I2(B,v′) molecules in a He expansion, which are found to be in the range of 15 to 700 Å2 with a dependence on the initially prepared vibrational level, v′.5,6
Method	In order to do this, high-resolution pump–probe spectra were recorded by probing the Δv = −1 channel that results from collisions between molecules initially prepared in the long-lived I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) and short-lived I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) levels and He atoms in the expansion.
Conclusion	However, using the aforementioned binding energies of the He⋯ICl, Ne⋯ICl, and H2⋯ICl complexes to estimate their well depth, as well as our velocity-slip experiments to determine Ttot, we find that the velocity slip is not nearly large enough to account for the different values of ZLJ that would be required to justify the observed vibrational-relaxation efficiencies.
Method	The ICl was seeded in a carrier gas by passing the gas over a vessel of solid ICl maintained at 274 K. A pure helium carrier gas was used unless otherwise noted.
Conclusion	This might lead one to believe that it is the mass mismatch, and thus the velocity slip, between the ICl molecule and the collision partner that gives rise to the different probabilities for collisional relaxation.
Result	The rotational quantum number of the I35Cl(B,v′) state associated with several of the P-lines are shown to emphasize the degree of rotational excitation in the product channels.
Method	We also assume dHe(ICl) = 3.7 Å, based on approximations of atomic He and molecular ICl diameters.43
Method	These quantities can be related to the Mach number, M, and consequently the distance downstream in nozzle diameters, xd−1, byT/T0 = [1 + M2 (γ – 1)/2]−1, where M = A (xd−1) γ−1,where A is a constant, 3.26 for a monatomic gas expansion.36
Result	Somewhat surprisingly, then, collision-induced vibrational relaxation mimics vibrational predissociation from lower intermolecular vibrational levels that tend to more localized in the T-shaped region, n′ = 0 or 2, more closely than vibrational predissociation from more highly excited intermolecular vibrational levels with states that are delocalized in the angular coordinate, such as the n′ = 4 level.
Method	The rates and cross sections for the collision-induced, vibrational energy relaxation of I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) rotor states down to I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) states, k3–2 and σ3–2, can be estimated using the f3–2 values measured at varying downstream distances.
Conclusion	For instance, in order to be in accord with our observed efficiencies, the ZLJ for the Ne expansion would have to be three orders of magnitude less than ZLJ for the He expansion.
Problem	In order to estimate a value for the velocity slip between the ICl molecules and the He atoms in the expansion as well as the velocity distribution of the ICl molecules, we have directly measured the time-of-flight of excited-state ICl* molecules that is needed to travel a fixed distance along the expansion using a pump–probe experimental scheme.
Method	The laser beams were spatially filtered down to ca. 1 mm diameters, and a 0.5 m focal length lens was inserted after the iris to focus the lasers to diameters of ca. 320 and ca. 180 μm for the pump and probe lasers, respectively, in the expansion region.
Result	It should be noted, though, that the intensity of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 LIF feature is weaker when using an Ar-carrier gas and, consequently, the signal-to-noise levels are worse than those of the ICl in He or Ne/He spectra.
Method	Eqn (2) is only valid for the region within an expansion where the two-body collision frequency is sufficient for continued cooling.
Method	The LIF spectra recorded in the ICl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 regions at several distances downstream are used to characterize the dependence of the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 band intensity on carrier gas density and I35Cl–He collision frequency.
Background	The He + I2 system has received extra attention in these studies because of the significant absorption cross section of I2 in the visible wavelength region, and because it was noted near the advent of supersonic beam methods that there is a large cross section for collisions of He atoms to induce vibrational relaxation of I2(B,v′).6
Result	We find that collisions between ICl molecules and He atoms occur over extended distances along the expansion direction.
Method	A UG-1 filter was used to block laser scatter from both the pump and probe lasers and to minimize the detection of intense ICl B → X emission induced by the pump laser.
Result	The intensities of the He⋯ICl features are ca. 100 times weaker than the ICl monomer bands.
Background	Furthermore, these conformers have different Franck–Condon windows, enabling access to different excited-state intermolecular vibrational levels.18
Method	These products are fit to a power dependence, lower dashed curve in Fig. 3, and normalized using the value of the fit at the shortest xd−1, open circles.
Result	The integrated intensities of the I35Cl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 bands recorded using a backing pressure of 14.8 bar and at four different distances downstream are shown in Fig. 3 as black squares and circles, respectively.
Result	The lighter H2 partner, in contrast, is the most efficient vibrational relaxation partner.
Method	The fluorescence was filtered spatially using a 16.5 mm × 2.8 mm mask, with the long axis positioned parallel to the expansion, so that only fluorescence from the center, coldest region of the expansion was detected by the PMT.
Method	The intermolecular translational energy that arises from the different terminal velocities of the seeded molecules and the carrier-gas atoms in an expansion gives rise to another temperature value, Tslip, that is not necessarily represented by either Tcalc or Trot.8,31,37–40
Method	The cross sections for vibrational relaxation induced by collisions with He atoms along the expansion, σ3–2, are then found usingσ3–2 = k3–2(μABπ/8kTAB)1/2/ρB,43where TAB is represented by either Trot or Ttot.
Result	The rotational-state distributions are bimodal with an overall maximum at j′ = 6 and another maximum at j′ = 12 in both of the Δv = −1 channels.
Conclusion	This similar dependence on the backing pressures supports the conclusion that the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) molecules that are detected following preparation of I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) rotor states are a consequence of collision-induced vibrational relaxation.
Result	Under these conditions an I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) rotational temperature of ca. 1.5 K was measured.
Background	Previous studies have shown, however, that for the low temperatures prevalent in a free-jet expansion a hard-sphere model is not appropriate.8,39,45–47
Conclusion	As noted previously,33 the reason for the discrepancy may be that for He expansions the terminal Mach number reached is much larger than that predicted using classical equations.
Problem	We also attempted to estimate the velocity distribution of the ICl molecules in the expansion by recording the temporal breadth of the pump–probe delay signals recorded as described above and with the pump laser at xd−1 = 11.1 and 24.4, and with backing pressures of 7.9 and 14.8 bar.
Method	Any ICl signals that arise from collisions of the ICl molecules with He atoms should be proportional to the product of the I35Cl–He collision frequency and the I35Cl density, ZLJ*ρI35Cl, at each downstream distance.
Result	The estimated values of ZLJ decrease almost an order of magnitude from ca. 9.7 × 107 collisions s−1 down to ca. 1.5 × 107 collisions s−1 with increasing distances in the range investigated.
Result	The collisions vibrationally relax a fraction, f3–2, of the predissociative I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) states down to the long-lived I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) rotor states, which in turn fluoresce.
Method	We then assume a lifetime of 0.5 ns for non-adiabatic dissociation onto the ICl(Z 1) state, τNA, corresponding to the lifetimes of I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) states with little rotational excitation.26,27
Method	The fraction of the predissociative I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) excited-state molecules that re-stabilize in rotational states of the I35Cl(B,v′ = 2) level, f3–2, is estimated using the LIF spectra, Fig. 1, and published Franck–Condon factors; the I35Cl B–X, 3–0 Franck–Condon factors are three times greater than those of the 2–0 band.49
Result	Note that the P-rotor lines are overlapped by weaker R-lines originating from states with higher rotational excitation.
Conclusion	At the same time, the vibrational relaxation can be modeled using a Lennard-Jones 6–12 collision-frequency model, arguing that there is no need to invoke a resonance-enhancement to the collisional cross section.
Result	Bimodal distributions are also evident in the vibrational predissociation measurements of He⋯ICl(B,v′ = 3) when preparing the complex in the lowest, n′ = 0, and second excited, n′ = 2, intermolecular vibrational levels.
Result	No evidence is observed for resonance-enhanced collisional cross sections, even at the low temperatures achieved, T < 1.0 K.
Problem	Finally, LIF spectra were also recorded using a pure hydrogen expansion.
Method	The temporal delay between the pump and probe lasers was typically 15 to 20 ns with a pulse-to-pulse timing jitter of ±1 ns.
Method	Previous experiments performed in our laboratory20 indicate that collisions of He atoms with ICl(X,v″ = 0) molecules and He⋯ICl(X,v″ = 0) complexes occur at downstream distances of at least xd−1 = 69, and thus eqns (1) and (2) would be expected to hold for regions in the expansion up to this distance.
Conclusion	However, considering that collisions will occur at multiple orientations, including the linear orientation, which has a longer hard-sphere radius than the T-shaped orientation,21 we believe that dHe(ICl) = 3.7 Å is a reasonable estimate.
Method	The thermodynamics for a perfect gas require the temperature T, pressure P, and density ρ, within the expansion region to be related byT/T0 = (P/P0)(γ−1)/γ = (ρ/ρ0)γ−1,where T0, P0, and ρ0 represent the temperature, pressure, and density of the reservoir gas behind the nozzle, and γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv, or 5/3 for a monatomic gas.36
Background	The ICl(B,v′ = 2) rotational product-state distributions that result from vibrational predissociation for these two extreme cases was reported previously, Fig. 5 of ref. 20, and is plotted here in Fig. 5b.
Result	The data in Fig. 3 also indicates that following the preparation of the short-lived rotational states within the I35Cl(B,v′ = 3) level, some of these excited-state molecules undergo collisions with He atoms in the expansion.
Conclusion	This provides some validity for using Trot as the local temperature in eqn (1), despite the fact that eqn (2) does not quantitatively reproduce our temperature measurements.
Result	Quantitatively, a comparison of the residuals between the collisional-relaxation product-state distribution and the half-collision n′ = 0, J′ = 0 distribution is ca. 35% less than for the comparison with the n′ = 4, J′ = 1 distribution.
Background	The rotational structure within the I35,37Cl B–X, 3–0 LIF features is accurately simulated using published ground and excited-state rotational constants and term values.22,23
Result	(Note the ×100 magnification of the fluorescence intensity scale for transition energies >17 665 cm−1).
Result	This time delay corresponds to an I35Cl velocity of ca. 1750(50) m s−1.
Result	The LIF spectrum recorded in the ICl B–X, 3–0 region, Fig. 1b, was also published previously, Fig. 2 of ref. 25, and is dominated by features attributed to transitions of the T-shaped and linear He⋯I35,37Cl(X,v″ = 0) complexes.16,18,24
Problem	We use here a fit of Knight’s reported values to determine the Ω(2,2)* values that correspond to our experimentally determined values for Ttot.
Conclusion	Thus, most of the available energy is converted into kinetic energy of the ICl* and He collision partners.
Result	The collision frequency increased linearly with backing pressure, as expected.
Method	For two-color, pump–probe experiments, the laser system described above was used as the pump laser, and a second commercial Nd:YAG (355 nm) pumped dye laser was used as the probe laser.
Conclusion	Since the I35Cl(X,v″ = 0) densities are orders of magnitude less than the total density in the expansion, the He-carrier gas density at each downstream distance is approximately ρ.
Method	The laser pulse energies for most of the scans performed in the ICl B–X, 2–0 and 3–0 region (560 to 567 nm) were ca. 20 mJ after the beam was spatially filtered to a diameter of 3 mm.
Result	Note that some collisional relaxation of ICl(B,v′ = 2) to ICl(B,v′ = 1) does occur, but this represents only ca. 1% of the ICl molecules excited.20
Background	These rare gas–dihalogen systems have the advantage of being both experimentally and theoretically feasible.13,14
Result	The values of f3–2 and τNA are then used to determine k3–2:k3–2 = f3–2/((1 − f3–2)τNA)The estimates of k3–2 at each xd−1 drop an order of magnitude, from ca. 107 s−1 down to ca. 106 s−1, with increasing downstream distance over the range investigated.
Method	Calculations of the He + ICl(B,v′ = 2) PES44 indicate that this approximation may be a slight overestimate for dHe(ICl).
Result	Using this value, we calculate hard-sphere collision frequencies ranging from 2.2 × 107 collisions s−1 at xd−1 = 5.8 down to 2.7 × 106 collisions s−1 at xd−1 = 14.0.
Result	When using a 100% Ar carrier gas, no ICl B–X, 3–0 LIF signals were observed.
Background	Several models and methods have been implemented in calculations of the collision frequencies of molecules with carrier gas atoms within supersonic expansions.
Result	Examining a slice through the T-shaped orientation reveals a hard-sphere radius of 3.34 Å.
Conclusion	The ability to accurately measure the ICl vibrational and rotational product-state distributions suggests that this system would be well-suited for complimentary theoretical investigations of intermolecular energy transfer.
Background	Also, the halogens have a low-lying electronic state, the B3Π0+ state, with multiple vibrational levels that can be easily accessed.
Result	Qualitatively, the bimodal structure for this channel is reproduced almost identically, with maxima at j′ = 5 and 13 and a minimum at j′ = 10.

Conclusion	The existence of a locatable transition state between the two valence forms suggests these minima may not simply be artifacts of the single reference KMLYP (and MP2) procedures, but genuine (aromatic and non-aromatic) isomers straddling a Möbius-type26 transition state (C3–O4–C5–C6 ≅38°/KMLYP) which represents the least stable configuration for the 4n + 2 π electrons present.
Result	The differing electronic nature of these two isomers is also reflected in the diatropic NMR character, as quantified using NICS values15 (Table 1); the planar B3LYP and KMLYP forms indicating moderate diatropicity, the twisted KMYLP form indicating a non-diatropic system comprising almost orthogonal pπ-pπ overlap at e.g. O4–C5.
Background	Experimentally,17b this system is reported as being planar in solution (from the 2,3JHH coupling constants), with 1H NMR shifts in a region (5.1–7.6 ppm) normally associated with diatropicity, but having a high olefin-like reactivity.
Problem	Here again a significant difference between B3LYP and KMLYP is predicted, the latter appearing to be the more correct in terms of the computed bond lengths (no dihedral angles being reported for this system).
Background	Somewhat surprisingly however, given the rather controversial origins surrounding the aromatic/non-aromatic/anti-aromatic character of the 4n1, less attention has been given to eight-membered rings involving instead 10 (and hence 4n + 2) rather than 8π electrons.
Conclusion	The computed geometries of a class of 10π-annulenes containing two heteroatoms, which exhibit an acutely sensitive balance between π and σ influences upon ring planarity, reveal that the recent KMLYP hybridisation of the exchange functional in the DFT method is qualitatively superior to the more commonly used B3LYP hybrid for modelling the aromaticity of such systems.
Problem	Also of interest is the parent ring system (4, XYO, RH).17b
Method	To invoke the KMLYP functional, the following Gaussian route commands were used:13 #iop(5/45 = 10000557) iop(5/46 = 00000443) #iop(5/47 = 04481000)For reference, some calculations were also performed at the (computationally very much more expensive) MP2 correlated level.
Result	Similar results were obtained at the larger 6-311+G(3d,p) basis set level, indicating this result is not highly basis set dependent.
Problem	It is possible that both planar and non-planar valence isomers are present as an equilibrium mixture in solution, thus imparting dual characteristics to this molecule.
Background	The heterocyclic 10π 1,4-heteroannulenes 4 are one such a class for which a number of crystal structures have been reported.
Result	The seven-ring analogue 6 (XYZNH) is predicted both slightly non-planar and diatropic; the only two known crystal structures of this 10π ring system (XYZNR27 and XYZSe28) likewise reveal non-planarity.
Conclusion	We propose that synthesis and accurate structure determination of a more comprehensive set of substituted heteroaromatics such as 4 or 6 could serve as a novel type of reference library which could serve as the basis for developing even better hybridisations of density functional and other methods.
Result	Both MP2 and KMLYP optimizations result in location of such isomer (C3–O4–C5–C6 ≅93° and ≅82.5° respectively), although only with the former is the more stable the non-planar form (vis the similar KMLYP behaviour for 4, XYN-Mesyl).
Background	Whilst the angular strain may be considered similar to that of 1, the presumption is that significantly more aromatic stabilisation will be present, hence tipping the balance towards planarity.
Background	Schleyer and Wannere16 have recently suggested that the degree of bond length alternation in both [14] and [18] annulene (2) may be significantly greater than inferred from the hitherto accepted (1995) analysis of the X-ray structure.10
Conclusion	At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level only one minimum corresponding to an almost planar structure could be located (Table 1); clearly this predicted geometry is qualitatively different from the crystal structure, and although crystal packing forces (no hydrogen bonding is possible) might explain the difference, there is little precedent for such large variation caused by this effect.
Problem	Aromaticity on the edge of chaos: An ab initio study of the bimodal balance between aromatic and non-aromatic structures for 10π-dihetero[8]annulenes
Problem	The N-dimethylamide group is predicted as intermediate in planarity between N-alkyl and N-ester, although the X-ray structure19 is quoted as being planar.
Result	Exact planarity from both (solid-state) experiment and calculation is a feature of the parent 1,4-dihydro-1,4-diazocine (4, XYNH) and the 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl) derivative,18 but not so when the N-substituent is an electron withdrawing ester group.19
Problem	Here we report a consistent set of calculations on such systems at two levels of theory, the standard B3LYP/6-31G(d) ab initio density functional procedure, and a newly reported13 rehybridisation known as KMLYP, in order to evaluate how sensitive the computed molecular geometries of such molecules are to variations in the computational method employed.
Background	The crystal structure of 1,4-dioxocine 4, XYO, R6-(pyran-4-on-2-yl)17 exhibits a non planar geometry, with an 81° dihedral angle for C3–O4–C5–C6 and an approximate C2 axis passing through the mid points of C2–C3 and C6–C7.
Conclusion	The analogy would be to planar 1 being the least stable 4n electronic configuration between two non-planar non-aromatic minima and hence a transition state connecting them.
Result	The (as yet unknown) parent system for 4, XO, YS, RH however shows another amplified difference between B3LYP and KMLYP.
Result	Valence bond isomers were located at both levels; for the former, the planar aromatic form was 3.0 kcal mol–1 lower, with KMLYP the non-aromatic form was 0.7 kcal mol–1 more stable.
Background	The [9]annulene monoanion 3 with D9h symmetry appears to be the largest 10π annulene ring which is both planar and can accommodate all-cisoid motives.12
Conclusion	No non-planar valence bond forms could be located at either level, although this does not preclude their existence as very shallow stationary points.
Conclusion	As such, they serve to provide challenging tests of modern quantitative electronic structure theories.
Result	All final energies and geometries are available as electronic supplementary information (ESI).
Background	With YN-Ts however, the crystal structure is described as “having considerable torsion”.20
Problem	Following this suggestion, we considered it appropriate to also evaluate these two computational procedures for the bimodal series 4 to see if it represents an improved procedure for use when modelling molecules with aromatic properties.
Background	They may indeed be good examples of bimodal molecules where small changes to the substituents can invoke disproportionately large changes in their structure; a phenomenon which could be described as aromaticity on the edge of chaos.
Background	This suggests that the balance between planarising aromaticity and non-planarising angular strain in these systems is a fine one.
Conclusion	We argue here that molecules such as 4–6 are good examples of bipolar systems on the chaotic edge of aromaticity, where small changes of substitution on either the ring or the heteroatom can induce large (but predictable) changes to both the degree of delocalisation of the double bonds, reflected in the corresponding planarity and hence aromaticity of the system.
Method	Diatropic character was estimated using the NICS procedure as described by Schleyer and coworkers15.
Method	Calculations were performed using Gaussian 98 (Rev A11)14 using standard optimization methods on all the known examples of ring system 4–6 for which crystal structures have been reported.
Result	Two valence bond isomers are also located at the MP2 correlated level, the non-planar being lower by 0.8 kcal mol–1.
Background	Dewar in 1945 was the first to recognise unambiguous aromatic character in a larger (seven-membered) ring,2 although the potential for aromaticity in the eight-membered ring cyclooctatetraene (1) had been considered much earlier, most revealingly by Penney3 in 1934 and Lennard-Jones in .19374
Background	Aromaticity as a concept has been dominated for most of its history by the study of benzenoid systems containing single or fused six-membered rings, and the recognition in the 1920s that this motif was associated both with ring planarity and with an “aromatic sextet” of electrons.1
Result	The series 4, XCH– are all predicted planar and are known25 to be diatropic (Table 1).
Result	4, XYN-mesyl at the KMLYP level also shows subtle behaviour; a non-planar stationary point appears as a near inflexion point during geometry optimization, but the final geometry is almost planar; at the MP2 level the non planar form is a genuine minimum.
Background	By 1945 in a review of non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons, Baker6 felt able to conclude that “it is doubtful if the instability of cyclooctatetraene can be explained on grounds of angular strain alone”, although it was not until 1965 that Breslow7 formalised this apparent instability with the term 4n “anti-aromatic”, invoking what had by then become known as the Hückel 4n + 2/4n rule8 of aromaticity.
Result	In contrast, two minima were located at the KMLYP/6-31G(d) level; an essentially planar aromatic-like geometry equivalent to the B3LYP structure, and an apparent valence bond isomer (lower than the former by ΔG 1.4 kcal mol–1 following zero-point and entropy corrections) which matches the twisted crystal structure with a predicted C3–O4–C5–C6 angle of 78°.
Conclusion	Of these, we suggest that the KMLYP/6-31(d) method appears capable of predicting this sensitivity more reliably than the older B3LYP treatment.
Background	Remarkably, these exhibit wide variation in ring planarity and degree of bond alternation, in synchrony with the diatropic/non-diatropic NMR character of the molecules.
Background	Penney appears to have been the first to consider planar and buckled conformations, and his analysis of angular strain in the (CH2)n rings in particular is remarkably prescient of the theories of conformational analysis developed some 15 years later by Barton.5
Problem	We therefore highlight this ring system as being close to a bimodal system on the edge of aromatic chaos, with relatively small changes to substituents apparently capable of invoking large changes in the geometry and aromaticity.
Result	Replacing a further ring carbon with a nitrogen heteroatom (5, XYN–CO2Me), Table 1) induces non-planarity which is more unambiguously predicted.
Conclusion	Finally, we note that only known example of a 6π four membered ring system (7, RCl, R′2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenyl) is also non-planar,29 but the origins of this are unlikely to be angular strain and are more likely associated either with poor pπpπ overlaps or a high degree of electron repulsion in a small ring.
Background	The latter was apparently the first to conclude from Hückel-like calculations that this 8π system would exhibit strong bond alternation and relatively little stabilisation as a planar species.
Result	Only a single planar minimum is predicted at B3LYP and KMLYP levels, with the NICS values indicating modest diatropicity.
Background	Noting that the commonly used B3LYP/6-31G(d) ab initio density functional procedure associated little bond alternation with a poor prediction of the 1H NMR shifts6 of 2, they found that use of Kang and Musgrave's (KMLYP) rehybridisation13 of the density functional exchange terms predicted greater bond alternation but significantly also a much superior match between the computed 1H NMR shifts at this geometry and experiment.
Result	MP2 optimisation results in location of two minima, the planar one being 2.6 kcal mol–1 lower than the non-planar form.
Background	Angular ring strain is avoided in larger monocyclic rings which also follow the 4n + 2 rule such as [14] or [18] annulene 210 by including transoid motifs to retain planarity or methano bridges11 to avoid close non-bonded contacts.
Problem	We considered that such bimodal molecules should serve as highly sensitive tests of modern quantitative electronic theories, since an accurate balance between ring strain, σ/π conjugation, bond delocalisation and associated electron correlation effects can often be a very difficult one to achieve in such theories.
Background	We use term apparent instability because it has recently9 been argued in fact that such 4n “anti-aromatic” species are not destabilized electronically to any significant extent.
Problem	This molecule may be particularly finely balanced between planar aromaticity and non-planar non-aromaticity and may again be a good example of a bipolar aromatic molecule.
Result	For the mixed heteroatom series, planarity is both observed and computed for XO, YN-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl.
Conclusion	When the pyranonyl substituent is replaced by the modestly more electronegative chloroacetyl group, both B3LYP and KMLYP now concur, predicting the ring to be exactly planar17 (at both the 6-31(d) and 6-311+G(3d,p) basis set levels) and in essential agreement with the crystal structure; the small experimental non-planarity (Table 1) may indeed now be due to crystal packing effects.
Result	The 1,4-dithiocine series (4, XYS)21,22 are all non-planar and equally well predicted with B3LYP and KMLYP, as is the oxathiocine (4, XO, YS).23

Background	It consists of more than 20 polypeptides, most of them with no function identified yet.
Method	NMR experiments were carried out at different pH and at different temperatures on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm BBI probe and a z-axis gradient unit.
Result	Especially, the reduced and the oxidised form of the PsbO E180C mutant show a signal dispersion and line widths in the 1D NMR spectrum that are virtually identical and comparable to the spectra of WT-PsbO.
Conclusion	This suggests that both PsbO domains of the disulfide linked dimer are folded and tumble, at least to a significant extent, independently free in solution.
Conclusion	From this preliminary comparison, it appears that flexible regions of free PsbO are motional restricted when bound to the PS2 complex.
Background	Several lines of experiments using different kinds of spectroscopic techniques or biochemical and theoretical analyses have made suggestions about the PsbO structure and its behaviour free in solution.
Method	The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded with a time domain of 2 k complex data points with 256 complex increments collected, and a sweep width of 12019.23 Hz in the 1H and 2128.68 Hz in the 15N dimension.
Method	Modified versions of the experiment proposed previously were used to determine 15N{1H}-NOE at 600.13 MHz proton frequency.29–36
Background	Recently, it was reported that reconstitution of the PS2-complex with PsbO is accompanied by changes of its secondary structure.19
Background	However, it is obvious from the recently published PS2 X-ray structure6 that the PsbO subunit is not directly involved in binding of manganese as part of the WOC.
Background	Remarkably, 65% of PsbO do not show any secondary structure elements in the X-ray structure of the PS2 complex.6
Problem	Here we report preliminary results from NMR-spectroscopy on PsbO from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (T. elongatus) describing its structural and dynamic properties.
Conclusion	Comparing our preliminary results with the B-factors for loop regions and the core of PsbO from the X-ray structure, there is evidence for the compelling hypothesis that originally flexible loops of free PsbO get motional restricted upon binding to PS2.
Method	Water suppression for 1D and 2D experiments was achieved by the watergate pulse scheme.28
Result	No significant changes in the 1D 1H NMR spectra were observed for spectra recorded at pH 3.6, 6.5, and 8.0.
Result	This is corroborated by the results from HPLC size exclusion experiments that show a monodispersed peak corresponding to an approximate molecular weight of 20 kDa for the recombinant PsbO (data not shown).
Background	The mutations T94C and Q196C are located in the folded β-barrel core of PsbO while the mutations E180C and N58C are part of the extended loops.
Problem	In order to investigate functional aspects of this protein, we have also carried out site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
Method	To prove the integrity of the recombinant protein, reconstitution experiments were performed with PS2 particles prepared according to .ref. 26
Result	This is further corroborated by the 15N{1H} NOE of wild-type PsbO.
Background	Recent advances in X-ray structure analysis of PS2 crystals5,6 provide a detailed view of the structure and organisation of the WOC.
Result	Fig. 2 shows a 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PsbO isotopically enriched with 15N at pH 3.6 and 310 K. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is characterised by a substantial amount of well dipersed resonances indicative for secondary structure elements (especially β-sheet) present in PsbO.38–40
Conclusion	In conclusion, the free thermophilic PsbO in solution is stable at pH 3.6 and 310 K as judged from the signal dispersion in the NMR spectra.
Method	The 15N-labeled samples were prepared from minimal medium with 15N NH4Cl as the nitrogen source.25
Result	Further, Fig. 1 shows that the line width of the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of WT-PsbO is characteristic for a monomeric state of the protein in solution.
Conclusion	Additional experiments with Cys residues introduced at different positions indicate sites of increased accessibility/flexibility which may be important for the docking to the PS2 core complex.
Background	Experiments with focus on the dynamic properties of the PsbO subunit led to the observation of pH-dependent and cofactor-induced structural changes in solution.11,17,18
Method	The periplasmic cell-fraction highly enriched with 33 kDa protein was isolated,24 dialysed against 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M mannitol, and loaded onto a ResourceQ column (Amersham-Pharmacia).
Background	It was concluded from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy8–10 and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy11,12 that the PsbO subunit in solution consists of a high content of β-sheet (30%) and random/loop structure (60%) whereas α-helical parts are only present in small amounts (10%).
Background	The primary electron transfer reaction occurs at the heterodimeric core of PS2 formed by the subunits D1 and D2, which bind most of the redox active cofactors.
Conclusion	Spectra of the oxidised and reduced forms of PsbO N58C and PsbO E180C suggest that loops responsible for the interaction with the PS2 complex are flexible and/or solvent exposed when free in solution.
Problem	In this report, we have used NMR-spectroscopy to elucidate preliminary structural and dynamic properties of the 33 kDa protein from the donor side of PS2.
Background	At the lumen side of PS2, the WOC is shielded by several extrinsic proteins.7
Background	Water oxidation to molecular oxygen is catalysed via the sequence of four one-electron oxidation steps (S-states) by the manganese containing water-oxidising complex (WOC).4
Conclusion	Overall, the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of wild-type PsbO is characteristic for a folded protein which also contains a considerable amount of unstructured parts.
Conclusion	Comparing the preliminary results presented in this study with the B-factors for loop regions and the core of PsbO from the X-ray structure, we propose that originally flexible loops of free PsbO, e.g. the longer loop, are structurally better defined after complexation with PS2.
Conclusion	This suggests that WT-PsbO is monomeric in solution.
Conclusion	In summary, we have shown by NMR-spectroscopy that apo-PsbO contains folded structural elements as concluded from the signal dispersion of 1D and 2D NMR spectra.
Conclusion	Our data suggest that PsbO, rather than forming a ‘molten globule’ state or being ‘natively unfolded’, contains both a well folded core and highly flexible regions.
Method	The 1D 1H NMR spectrum was recorded with a time domain of 32 k complex points and a sweep width of 12376.24 Hz.
Method	Point mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.23
Result	However, the 1D 1H NMR and the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra also show intense signals at 1–2 ppm and at 8.5 ppm characteristic for unstructured polypeptide chains.
Method	The PsbO protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium T. elongatus was overexpressed in E. coli. Its ability to restore the water splitting activity of CaCl2-washed PS2 was shown by reconstitution experiments.
Method	The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl.
Background	One of them, the 33 kDa protein (PsbO), is of special interest because it is ubiquitous in all photosynthetic organisms performing water-splitting and its extraction results in a strong decrease of the oxygen evolving activity.
Background	It is interesting to note that especially the longer loop (carrying the mutation E180C) which is composed of 40 residues does not show any secondary structure elements in the X-ray structure of the PS2 complex from T. elongatus.
Result	Fig. 4 shows 1D 1H NMR spectra of the oxidised and the reduced form of mutant N58C and E180C.
Method	The recombinant 33 kDa protein was expressed in E. coli from an expression plasmid containing the full-length sequence of the T. elongatus psbO gene resulting in the export of PsbO into the periplasmic space.22
Conclusion	Based on these results we propose that changes in the flexibility between the free and bound form of PsbO, particularly of the loop regions, are responsible for an efficient binding of PsbO to the PS2 core and might play a crucial role in modulating the binding affinity.
Method	Albeit no assignments are available, the NOE values were quantified based on the fraction of resolved peaks with NOE values less than 0.5 versus the total number of resolved resonances observed in the experiment.
Background	Therefore, it is often referred to as manganese stabilizing protein (MSP).
Result	Out of 109 resolved and dispersed resonances in the 15N{1H} NOE experiment, approximately 29 show values less than 0.5 suggesting that these residues are part of unstructured elements of PsbO (data not shown).
Conclusion	Furthermore, our analysis of the cysteine mutants indicates that the presence of the disulfide bond C19–C44 in PsbO from T. elongatus might not be critical for a stable fold.
Background	These results were consistent with secondary structure prediction methods and folding models of the 33 kDa protein.13–15
Background	Some authors suggested an unusual folding behaviour for PsbO in solution and therefore postulated an ‘intrinsically disordered’, ‘natively unfolded’ or ‘molten globule’ protein structure.10,16
Result	Routinely, about 50% of the original oxygen-evolving activity was obtained with the reconstituted PS2 (data not shown).
Background	Especially, the role of the numerous small membrane spanning peptides is still unclear.3
Conclusion	The line width of these 1D spectra did not change dramatically suggesting that PsbO structure is stable at higher temperatures.
Method	Uncertainties for NOE values were determined from triple recording of the whole relaxation experiment.
Conclusion	The NMR spectra suggest that PsbO rather than forming a ‘molten globule’ state or being ‘natively unfolded’, contains both a well folded core and highly flexible regions.
Result	The dispersion of aliphatic and amide proton resonances clearly indicates that the protein is, at least in part, comprised of a well folded core domain.
Result	Typically, the line width for several selected aliphatic resonances is approximately 24–27 Hz for WT-PsbO, 28–29 Hz for oxidised N58C and 21–22 Hz for reduced N58C, and approximately 24 Hz for oxidised E180C as well as for reduced E180C.
Method	These mutants were analysed by SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of DTT.
Problem	Preliminary structural characterisation of the 33 kDa protein (PsbO) in solution studied by site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy
Background	This loop does not show elevated B-factors in comparison to the core of the protein which could be explained by its various contacts to other subunits of the PS2 complex, such as D2, CP47, and the 12 kDa-Protein (PsbU).
Method	Unless otherwise stated, PsbO protein samples for NMR experiments were prepared in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 3.6, supplemented with 10% D2O.
Result	Fig. 3 shows that two of them, N58C and E180C, form dimers whereas T94C and Q196C are monomeric under oxidizing conditions.
Result	In addition, the 15N{1H}-NOE experiment provides evidence for a significant number of residues that show a higher degree of flexibility (approx.
Conclusion	The PsbO protein shows a remarkable temperature, pH, and long term stability beeing stable for at least four weeks under the conditions tested in this study.
Conclusion	This is further corroborated by the changes of apparent hyperfine splitting and line width of EPR spectra recorded with spin labeled PsbO E180C free in solution and after reconstitution of the PS2 complex (Nowaczyk, unpublished data).
Problem	In order to investigate the accessibility and mobility of surface-exposed structural protein elements, we created four mutants containing an additional cystein each at a different position in the amino acid chain of PsbO.
Method	Peaks that cluster around 8.5 ppm have been omitted in this preliminary analysis due to spectral overlap.
Method	The 15N{1H}-NOE was recorded in an interleaved manner to reduce influences from possible instabilities under the chosen experimental conditions.
Method	NMR spectra were processed and analysed with XWINNMR (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), NMRPipe, NMRDraw, and NMRView.37
Conclusion	From these results we conclude, that the regions around residues Asn58 and Glu180 of PsbO are either flexible and/or solvent exposed to allow the formation of a disulfide bond between two PsbO molecules.
Problem	In order to test the influence of different experimental conditions on the stability of WT-PsbO we recorded several 1D 1H NMR spectra at different pH values and at different temperatures.
Result	30–40%).
Background	Indeed, there are hints for structural changes of the bound PsbO subunit depending on the oxidation state of the manganese cluster.20,21
Conclusion	Obviously, PsbO retains its fold and is not denatured by lowering the pH from 6.5 to 3.6.
Problem	Site-directed mutagenesis experiments combined with 1D and 2D NMR spectra provide a preliminary insight into the structure and dynamics of the 33 kDa protein (PsbO) from T. elongatus free in solution.
Conclusion	This core shows remarkable stability over a broad range of temperatures and pH values.
Result	Fig. 1 shows the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of wild-type PsbO free in solution.
Conclusion	In conclusion, the structured core should be one of the major reasons for the thermostability of the thermophilic 33 kDa protein where a variety of factors may contribute to this stability as shown for other thermophilic proteins41.
Problem	Due to this extraordinary stability of PsbO, we characterised four cysteine mutants serving as local probes for structural and dynamic properties of PsbO.
Background	Obviously, the folded core region sterically prevents the formation of a dimer while the Cys residues in the loops are easily accessible for interaction.
Conclusion	The 1D and 2D NMR spectra suggest that PsbO free in solution adopts a defined structured core.
Conclusion	It is also in accordance with the observation that removal of the cysteins of PsbO by mutagenesis neither impaired its binding to PS2 nor influenced its water-splitting activity.42
Background	However, the presence of a considerable amount of flexible regions in the free form of PsbO does not explain why PsbO from T. elongatus exhibits a higher thermostability than PsbO from spinach, especially as the content of Pro residues is virtually indentical in both organisms (5.6% for spinach compared to 5.3% for T. elongatus).43
Result	Based on the 15N{1H} NOE, at least an estimated 30% to 40% of all residues of WT-PsbO show increased flexibility on the ps to ns time scale (data not shown).
Method	NOE values were calculated from the ratio of the peak heights in the experiment with and without proton saturation.
Method	Therefore, we recorded several 1D NMR spectra at 298 K, 310 K, 313 K, and 318 K with a buffer pH adjusted to 3.6.
Result	This is consistent with the X-ray structure of PsbO that contains 30% β-sheet and 5% α-helix with several loops involved in binding to the PS2-complex.
Conclusion	From this we conclude that the loops carrying the point mutation exhibit an increased degree of flexibility in the apo-form of PsbO.
Result	No significant protein degradation was observed even after four weeks.
Result	By this method, we obtained highly purified PsbO (up to 20 mg L−1 culture).
Conclusion	The spectra also indicate that the PsbO from T. elongatus in solution contains a considerable amount of flexible regions.
Result	These values indicate that the line width does not significantly change upon reduction of the oxidised mutants of PsbO as a more dramatic change would be expected from the decrease in molecular weight (52 kDa compared to 26 kDa).
Method	The 15N{1H}-NOE experiment was recorded using a 4.9 s saturation period and an additional recycle delay of 5 s.
Method	These particles were washed with 1 M CaCl2 to remove the extrinsic proteins before adding the recombinant PsbO protein27.
Background	Nevertheless, this is only in part consistent with the analysis of the B-factors obtained from the X-ray structure where the loops do not show elevated values compared to the core of PsbO.
Result	Interestingly, in our experiments the signal dispersion and the line width in the 1D NMR spectra of the reduced mutant proteins does not dramatically differ from the spectra recorded in the absence of DTT.
Background	Photosystem 2 (PS2) is part of the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria and performs one of the key reactions on our planet: the light-driven oxidation of water.1,2

Background	Far-infrared synchrotron radiation from an electron storage ring provides a far more brilliant source than conventional black body radiators, if the noise problems connected with electron beam oscillations can be solved.
Method	The plane of polarization is then converted to vertical, since far-infrared beam splitters are more effective with this polarization.

Method	In order to determine the values of the upper state spectroscopic constants B′ and D′J (v6 = l) for HCN–H35Cl the standard semi-rigid linear molecule model based on the following rovibrational energy expressions for the vibrational ground state, E″, and excited vibrational state, E′, is used:E″ = B″J(J + 1) − D″JJ2(J + 1)2E′ = ν0 + B′J(J + 1) − D′JJ2(J + 1)2 ± (1/2)q6J(J + 1)In the fit the ground-state constants B″and D″J are constrained to the MW values for HCN–H35Cl reported in .ref. 5
Conclusion	Interpretation of the spectroscopic constants led to the conclusion that the most stable configuration of the molecular complex of HCN and HCl is collinear or near collinear at equilibrium, establishing the presence of a hydrogen bond to the N atom of the HCN molecule.
Method	The detector element is small, and allows us to use high scanning speeds.
Result	It is not possible to assign corresponding P- and R-branch lines which makes it difficult to establish the definitive J-assignments of the Q-branch lines.

Method	The present experiments are carried out at the infrared beam-line at MAX-Lab at Lund University.
Method	This background resolution is appropriate in order to cancel out the most dominant interference fringes.
Method	MAX-I is a 550 MeV electron storage ring with a 250 mA maximum ring current and a mean lifetime of 4 h.
Background	A high-brightness source of far-infrared synchrotron radiation is therefore suitable for measurements in which high spectral resolution and high sensitivity is needed simultaneously.
Result	These features are assigned to the ν16 + ν17 − ν17 and ν16 + 2ν27 − 2ν27 hot bands for DCN–H35Cl and are assumed to consist of Q-branch lines.
Result	The central Q-branch of the band for DCN–H35Cl is located at 331.7 cm−1 and the R-branch forms a band head near 335.62 cm−1.
Result	It appears that the effective ΔB value obtained from the Q-branch fit is larger than the ΔB value from the P, R-branch fit.
Method	A total scan time for each spectrum of ca. 10 h is achieved.
Result	The calculated harmonic force constants for the intermolecular hydrogen bond stretching vibration νσ for the ground state and the excited HCl libration state indicate that the excitation of the HCl libration mode destabilizes the intermolecular interaction between HCN and HCl by almost 20%.
Method	Line positions from the absorbance spectra are generated using the Microcal Origin 7.0 software package (Microcal software, Inc)..
Method	The absolute wavenumber scale of the absorption spectrum is calibrated against published rotational lines of H2O21 observed in the spectrum.
Method	If we assume that this anharmonic term also determines the shifts of the observed ν16 + ν17 − ν17 hot bands, we can estimate the HCl libration shifts expected from the k6677 term alone.
Result	The J-assignment leading to the fit with minimum standard deviation is chosen and the resulting spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 1.

Method	In this fit, the ground-state spectroscopic constants are constrained to the values obtained from the GSCD analysis.
Background	In the strong HCN–HF dimer the hydrogen bond weakens by ca. 20% upon excitation of the HF libration mode and for the weaker OC–HCl dimer the hydrogen bond is destabilized by almost 30% upon excitation of the HCl libration mode.
Method	A cold band pass optical filter (0–370 cm−1) is mounted in the bolometer in order to reduce the photonic noise level and detector nonlinearity effects in the final spectra.
Result	The precision of the line positions is estimated to be ten times better than the spectral resolution.
Method	The partial pressures of HCN and natural isotopic HCl in the absorption cell are 2 Torr and 5 Torr, respectively.
Background	However, the steep fall-off of energy with decreasing frequency for conventional black body radiators means that far-infrared spectroscopy generally is energy-limited at normal source temperatures in the sense that the resolution which can be attained is ultimately limited by the intensity of the source.
Method	The base length of the absorption cell is 2.85 m and the optics provide a total optical path length of ca. 91.2 m.

Method	A temperature controlled 200-L static absorption cell made of stainless steel is interfaced with a Bruker IFS 120 HR Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS).
Result	This indicates the presence of l-type doubling23 which is accounted for in eqn. (2).
Result	In the harmonic oscillator approximation based on the HCl libration band origin and the rotational constant for HCl the classical HCl bending amplitude θHCl increases from 14.4° in the ground state to 20.3° upon excitation of the HCl libration mode for H12CN–H35Cl.
Result	However, an estimate of the band origin of 314.60(15) cm−1 seems reasonable, and this is taken as a further confirmation that our assignment of the hot band progressions is consistent.

Result	The assigned transitions for DCN–H37Cl are listed in Table S4, provided as ESI.
Background	The low-wavenumber intermolecular vibrational degrees of freedom depend directly on the properties of the IPES and are therefore of special importance.
Background	However, only a few numbers of these studies have dealt with the important intermolecular part of the vibrational spectrum for such molecular complexes.

Background	A red shift of 107 cm−1 of the ν2 band of HCN–H35Cl relative to the H–Cl stretching vibration band for monomeric H35Cl together with a positive value of ΔB upon vibrational excitation of ν2 showed that the hydrogen bond strengthens upon intramolecular vibrational excitation of the ν2 mode.
Conclusion	The estimated differences in these shifts upon isotopic substitution are much smaller than the observed blueshifts and it seems that the fourth term in the potential energy function involving the anharmonic force constant k6677 is more important for the couplings.

Method	The values of the force constant k7 are estimated from Bender et al.6
Conclusion	The electric dipole moment of HCl is tilted away from the intermolecular symmetry axis in the molecular complex as the HCl subunit carries out the librational motion and the dipole–dipole interaction becomes more unfavorable owing to the enhanced non-linearity of the configuration.

Conclusion	The observed decrease of the rotational constants B together with the simultaneous increase of the quartic centrifugal distortion constants DJ upon excitation of the HCl libration modes indicate that the hydrogen bond in the molecular complexes is significantly destabilized upon excitation of the intermolecular HCl libration modes.
Conclusion	This observation together with the fact that the HCN–HCl system has high symmetry in the equilibrium configuration suggest that a standard semi-rigid linear molecule model is suitable for the present spectral analysis.
Method	Geometry optimization procedures are performed for HCN, HCl and HCN–HCl using CCSD(T)31 methodology in combination with correlation consistent polarized valence double-, triple- and quadruple zeta basis sets including polarization and diffuse functions.32
Result	The Q-branch and the P-branch are assigned to J = 71 and 61, respectively.
Problem	The present study reports the direct observation and rovibrational analysis of the intermolecular HCl libration band of HCN–HCl, DCN–HCl and H13CN–HCl by means of static gas-phase Fourier transform far-infrared spectroscopy and a far-infrared synchrotron radiation source.
Method	The detector is a liquid He cooled Si-bolometer operating at 1.7 K (Infrared Laboratories, Inc)..
Method	In order to estimate the basis set limit we use the results of Dunning.34
Method	We estimate the importance of the third term in the potential energy function involving the mixed harmonic force constant k67 assuming that the HCN libration and the coupling between the libration modes are dominated by the dipole–dipole interaction (k67 = 1/2k7).
Method	This potential energy function may not provide an entirely satisfactory description of the radial behavour of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction but has the clear advantage that it allows the dissociation energy of the molecular complex to be estimated from the values of B and DJ alone.
Result	Tentative J-assignments of these Q-branches yield the band origins of 326.50(10) cm−1 and 321.60(20) cm−1, respectively.
Result	A hot band pattern with rotational resolved features at ca. 325 and 320 cm−1 is observed in the absorption spectrum.
Result	A number of additional weak absorption lines is observed in the Q-branch region for HCN–H35Cl.
Result	The resulting values of ν0, ΔB and ΔDJ and q6 are listed in Table 1.
Result	A number of ν16 + ν17 − ν17 and ν16 + 2ν72 − 2ν72 hot bands are observed in the spectra and the sum of the anharmonicity constants X6,7 + g6,7 is estimated.
Method	The absorption cell has a White type multipass mirror system.
Method	The hydrogen cyanide samples are dried by vacuum distillation through a column containing the P2O5 drying agent.
Method	The present P- and R-branch assignments allow us to perform a ground-state combination difference (GSCD) analysis for DCN–H35Cl.
Result	This branch is assigned up to J = 51.
Background	In contrast to the wealth of spectroscopic information available for the closely related prototype dimer HCN–HF (see ref. 3 and references therein) and to a lesser extent for (HCN)2 (see ref. 4, and references therein) the spectroscopic information about the molecular complex HCN–HCl reported in the literature is rather limited.
Conclusion	The relative HCl libration band origins seem to be determined from the anharmonic coupling to the HCN libration modes.
Background	Measurements of rotationally resolved absorption spectra of intermolecular vibrations of gaseous molecular complexes require a spectral resolution close to the Doppler limit in the far-infrared spectral region.
Background	This was demonstrated in our earlier publication on the intermolecular HCl libration band ν41of the linear hydrogen-bonded heterodimer OC–H35Cl.1,2
Background	For (H2O)2, the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory yields 94% of the value for the basis set limit.
Result	The Q-branch and the P-branch are assigned to J = 72 and 56, respectively.
Background	The radiation output from the electron storage ring relative to the radiation output from a conventional globar source is characterized in refs. 11 and 12.
Conclusion	The dipole–dipole interaction between HCN and HCl can be described by a simple potential energy function:where μHCN and μHCl are the electric dipole moments of HCN and HCl, respectively, θHCl and θHCN are the libration angles (the angles between the two monomeric species and the line between the centers of mass), (ϕ1 − ϕ2) is the dihedral angle and r is the center of mass separation.
Background	The observed small red shift of 2.5 cm−1 for the band origin of ν1 of HCN–H35Cl relative to the C–H stretching vibration band of monomer HCN indicates that the hydrogen bond is rather unaffected by excitation of the ν1 mode.
Result	This branch is assigned up to J = 39.
Result	A limited number of Q-branch lines are observed and assigned for the ν16 bands of the corresponding 37Cl species in natural abundance.
Method	A total number of 132 assigned P-, Q- and R-branch transitions are subsequently analyzed simultaneously using the standard semi-rigid linear molecule model based on eqns. (1) and (2) to obtain values of the band origin ν0 and the upper state rotational constant B′, the upper state quartic centrifugal distortion constant D′J and the l-type doubling constant q6.
Result	These features seem to consist of Q-branch lines only.
Method	The center of mass separation r between HCN and HCl is related to the rotational constant according to:where B is the rotational constant of the molecular complex, IHCN and IHCl are the moments of inertia for the HCN and HCl subunits and μ is the reduced mass of the molecular complex.
Result	The J-assignment of the Q-branch and the determination of the spectroscopic constants ν0, ΔB and ΔDJ for the HCN–H37Cl isotopomer are based on a fit of the 15 observed transitions to the conventional diatomic molecule expression given in eqn. (3):Q(J) = ν0 + ΔBJ(J + 1) − ΔDJJ2(J + 1)2Since the polynomial fit is based solely on observed Q-branch transitions the determined value of ΔB is affected by l-type doubling.
Result	The central Q-branch of the band is located at 331.4 cm−1 and degrades widely at lower wavenumbers.
Method	Throughout the measurements the FTS is evacuated by a vacuum pump reducing absorption by atmospheric gasses in the optical path inside the FTS.
Result	A similar hot band pattern consisting of rovibrational structures centered at ca. 325, 320 and 315 cm−1 is observed in the present spectrum.
Background	In the analysis of the ν1 band for HCN–HCl by Bender et al6. the hot band progressions ν1 + ν17 − ν17, ν1 + 2ν27 − 2ν27 and ν1 + 3ν37 − 3ν37 from the low-wavenumber hydrogen-bond bending vibration ν17 were observed.6
Result	For the R-branch the band head appears for J = 55, 56.
Result	An additional number of weak absorption lines is observed in the Q-branch region for DCN–H35Cl.
Conclusion	The estimated force constants suggest that the excitation of the HCl libration mode destabilizes the intermolecular interaction between HCN and HCl by almost 20%.
Background	Unfortunately, the Morse model described in ref. 1 cannot give values for the dissociation energy De of the molecular complex without values for the sextic centrifugal distortion constant HJ.
Result	The harmonic frequency for the hydrogen bond stretching vibration for H12CN–H35Cl decreases from ca. 100(5) to 90(5) cm−1 upon excitation of ν16 and the corresponding harmonic force constant thereby decreases by 19%.
Problem	In the harmonic oscillator approximation we expect that the HCl libration frequencies are lower for the heavier isotopomers.
Result	The Q-branch and the P-branch are assigned to J = 65 and 53, respectively.
Method	Single-point energy calculations on selected geometries are performed in order to calculate BSSE corrections being assessed using the counterpoise (CP) correction, as suggested by Boys and Bernadi.33
Result	From a tentative J-assignment of the 325 cm−1 feature, which is assigned to the ν16 + ν17 − ν17 hot band, the band origin is estimated to be 325.690(5) cm−1.
Result	The resulting spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 1.
Method	In an attempt to quantify the relative dissociation energy from the determined values for the ground-state spectroscopic constants Legon et al5. used the Lennard-Jones 6/12 potential function.
Background	The harmonic frequency for the intermolecular HCl libration band ν16 (νB) is computed to be 311 cm−1 in the ab initio study by Araújo et al.10
Method	The combination of optical filters at the bolometer, the 6 μm multilayer beam splitter and the CsI cell and exit windows gives a band pass in the region 190–370 cm−1.
Result	A least-squares fit of a total number of 95 rovibrational transitions determines the values of ν0, ΔB, ΔDJ and q6 listed in Table 1.
Result	These values are the same as those obtained using Millen’s modified pseudodiatomic approximation.9

Method	This extract was analysed by CG-MS, FAB-MS and 1H-NMR.
Problem	To support this likely possibility, a sample of KY zeolite after being used for the reaction of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid was dissolved using concentrated HF acid and the resulting liquor extracted with dichloromethane in order to recover the organic material adsorbed within the pores.
Background	Particularly challenging is when the organic guest is too large to be adsorbed from the exterior into the internal pores.
Problem	In addition, other possible transient species and, in particular, the radical cation, must exhibit a very different optical spectrum according to the literature for related biphenyl.9
Background	To overcome this limitation a strategy has consisted in the chemical modification of the polymers by putting methylene bridges between two consecutive phenylene rings (polyfluorene derivatives) that thwart the mobility of the rings.
Conclusion	The solid exhibits the characteristic photoluminescence spectrum of polyphenylene polymer although somewhat broader.
Result	Diffuse-reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy of the zeolite after the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling also reveals the presence of aromatic compounds adsorbed in the solid exhibiting as the most intense absorption band at 260 nm together with other less intense bands around 350 nm.
Method	The extract was dissolved in dichloromethane and extracted with water and brine.
Result	Fig. 4 shows the transient spectrum recorded for p-tetraphenyl in acetonitrile at different delays after the laser pulse.
Problem	If this were the case then a certain amount of oligomers formed in the zeolite cavities would become imprisoned inside the pores without any possibility to diffuse to the exterior of the particle.
Method	The organic phase was dried, the solvent evaporated under vacuum and the residue submitted to column chromatography.
Result	As expected, the presence of intense emission (λmax 380 nm) upon 266 nm excitation was observed independently in a fluorescence measurement in acetonitrile.
Result	The transient at λmax = 475 nm observed in the laser flash photolysis decays in the microsecond time scale with a half-life of 24 µs.
Conclusion	By applying the Suzuki–Miyaura conditions using a palladium-containing basic zeolite, it has been possible to produce a zeolite that incorporates phenylene oligomers.
Method	When polymer precipitation was observed, the solution was filtered hot and the obtained solid was washed in boiling water until no dissolved palladium species were observed in the aqueous phase.
Method	The mixture was placed in a preheated oil bath at 60 °C and stirred magnetically for 24 h.
Method	Laser flash photolysis experiments were carried out using the fourth (266 nm, ≤20 mJ × pulse–1) harmonic of a Surelite Nd-YAG laser for excitation (pulse ≤10 ns).
Background	This prediction would be compatible with the product distribution observed upon dissolving the solid with HF in which the maximum number of rings observed was 5.
Result	Spectroscopic characterisation of the PP-loaded PdCl2–KY zeolite is also compatible with the presence of phenylene oligomers.
Background	This photochemical technique is complementary to photoluminescence studies, allowing the detection of photochemical generated transient species even if they are not emissive.
Method	The black solid was dried under reduced pressure (10–1 bar) for 6 h and the chemical combustion analysis was found C6H4.
Method	In order to effect the p-phenylene coupling one of the current most versatile reactions consists in the Suzuki–Miyaura homocoupling of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid in toluene using Pd-complexes as catalysts in basic media.4,5
Method	Chemical analysis reveals that the level of Na+-to-K+ exchange was 85%.
Result	Fig. 2 shows the corresponding emission and excitation spectra recorded for the zeolite encapsulated PP.
Problem	We expected that the same type of compounds were also formed within the interior of the pores and that due to the linear geometry and rigidity of these compounds, the diffusion through the pores will be impeded.
Result	Upon 266 nm laser excitation a diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum decaying in the µs time-scale was recorded (Fig. 3).
Method	The signal from the monochromator/photomultiplier detection system was capture by a Tektronix 2440 digitizer and transferred to a computer that controlled the experiment and provided suitable processing and data storage capabilities10.
Method	A dispersion of 1 g of zeolite in 5 mL of solution was stirred for 5 h at 80°.
Background	Moreover, by using basic zeolites we have demonstrated that the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction catalysed by zeolites supporting palladium salts does not require the presence of extrinsic base.6
Result	According to the data reported in the literature7 the emission and excitation spectra shown in Fig. 2 is very similar to that of pure PP, although the emission of encapsulated PP is somewhat broader and less vibrationally resolved than that observed for pure PP thin films.
Method	The product was characterised by GC-MS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR.
Background	This is the case of organic polymers or oligomers encapsulated inside zeolites.
Background	However, it has to be noted that according to the literature the photoluminescence of pure PP becomes broader when the emission is recorded for powders rather than for films.7
Result	The PP loaded PdCl2–KY exhibits the characteristic PP photoluminescence peaking at 465 nm when the sample is excited at 380 nm.
Result	Concerning the size of the oligomers product analysis suggests a distribution of short oligomers of 3, 4 and 5 rings with an approximate distribution of 70, 15 and 5%, respectively.
Method	The PdCl2–KY was obtained by the incipient wetness methodology.
Method	The KY zeolite was prepared through two consecutive ion exchanges starting from a 1 M solution of potassium acetate in bidistilled water and NaY-zeolite (CBV-100, PQ industries).
Background	As a general phenomenon it has been observed that incorporation of a guest inside the zeolite micropores disfavors radiationless deactivation pathways arising from conformational mobility.1
Method	The solution was filtered hot and the solid was submitted to Soxhlet extraction (ethanol and dichloromethane).
Result	The GC-MS after dissolving the solid reveals a complex mixture, mostly being terphenylene (80%) accompanied with tetraphenylene (10%) and other oligomers.
Result	While the maximum at 480 nm and the corresponding shoulders are due to the PP emission, the peak at 620 nm corresponds to an optical artefact due to the front-face arrangement used to measure the emission in opaque powders.
Result	Fig. 1 shows the aromatic region of the PP loaded PdCl2–KY compared to the IR of an authentic sample of PP prepared by conventional synthetic procedures using Pd2(dba)3 as catalyst under the reaction conditions analogous to those used for the preparation of the zeolite encapsulated oligomers.
Method	Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Analytical Instruments FL900 spectrophotometer.
Problem	Therefore, in order to address the nature of the transient shown in Fig. 3 and considering that our previous characterisation points to phenylene oligomers as the most likely guests inside zeolite-Y, we submitted to laser flash photolysis p-tetraphenyl in acetonitrile solution whereby a transient peaking at 465 nm similar to that recorded in zeolite was observed. p-Tetraphenyl is easily obtained by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 4-biphenyl boronic acid and 4-bromobiphenyl.
Result	The presence of a residual amount of acid protons of the boronic acid groups was also assessed by a signal around 9.0 ppm.
Conclusion	Taking into account the rigidity of the polyphenylene oligomers, its linear geometry as well as the geometry of the faujasite micropores formed by cavities tetrahedrally arranged, the most likely possibility is that the phenylene oligomers occupy two neighbour cavities (around 26 Å length).
Problem	Preparation and photochemical properties of p-phenylene oligomers encapsulated within faujasite Y
Method	After cooling, the mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum.
Background	In the case of the transient recorded for PPP encapsulated in KY zeolite, the presence of oxygen only exerts a minor influence on the kinetics, but this is not without precedent considering the impeded diffusion of oxygen through the micropore of hydrated zeolites.1,8
Background	In view of the activity of these zeolites to effect the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction it occurred to us that it should be possible to apply this strategy to effect the ship-in-a-bottle synthesis of phenylene oligomers entrapped inside the zeolite cavities.
Conclusion	The minor differences between the spectrum of p-tetraphenyl and that recorded for PP in KY can be due to the presence of a distribution of oligophenylenes and/or the presence of residual Pd atoms on the zeolite.
Background	Encapsulation of organic compounds inside the rigid pores of zeolites has become a routine tool in supramolecular chemistry to alter and control the photophysical properties of incarcerated guest.1
Background	Molecular modelling using the optimized geometry for zeolite and phenylene oligomers indicates that the maximum number of polyphenylene units that can be accommodated inside the zeolite cavities corresponds to 5.
Result	This transient was safely attributed to the triplet excited state based on the oxygen quenching.
Conclusion	Therefore, based on the similarity of the optical spectra in zeolite and acetonitrile solution for p-tetraphenyl, the transient observed in the laser flash photolysis of zeolites was attributed to the corresponding triplet excited state of encapsulated phenylene oligomers.
Conclusion	Deboronation catalyzed by Pd occurs concomitantly with the Suzuki homocoupling.
Result	In the FAB-MS of the liquor after dissolving the zeolite, peaks corresponding to up to 5 aromatic rings (detected in the GC-MS) were observed. 1H-NMR of the organic extract after dissolving the PdCl2–KY also shows the presence of aromatic protons appearing as unresolved peaks between 7.8 and 7.2 ppm.
Problem	Herein, we describe the in situ synthesis of p-phenylene oligomers (PP) inside the cavities of faujasite-Y and the photochemical properties of the resulting encapsulated oligomers.
Background	In particular, potassium exchanged Y zeolite (KY) was found to exhibit an adequate basic strength for the reaction of bromobenzene and phenylboronic acid.6
Result	Analysis of the signal temporal profile at different wavelengths (inset of Fig. 3) shows that the decays are coincident suggesting that the transient spectrum corresponds to a single species.
Background	The reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received.
Method	1,4-Phenylenediboronic acid (146.4 mg, 0.6 mmol) in toluene (20 mL) was magnetically stirred at 110 °C for 48 h in the presence of 2 g of PdCl2–KY.
Background	Concerning the emission efficiency it had been demonstrated that the conformational mobility of the phenylene rings permitting the ring twisting is one of the major radiationless deactivation pathways causing the decrease of emission quantum yields.
Conclusion	The encapsulated oligomers emit the characteristic blue light upon excitation and laser flash photolysis reveals the formation of long-lived transient decaying in hundreds of µs that has been attributed to the corresponding triplet excited state.
Method	Then, NaAcO (1.5 mmol) and Pd2(dba)3 (0.05 mmol) were introduced in a vessel and the solution was added.
Result	Oxygen purging does not noticeably decrease the emission intensity and, therefore, the encapsulated PP is a fluorescent solid in the open air.
Background	Much to our surprise a search through the chemical database reveals that the laser flash photolysis study of PPP has never been previously reported.
Method	The sample of PP encapsulated in zeolite was submitted to laser flash photolysis.
Result	In particular, FT-IR spectroscopy of the PP loaded zeolite after outgassing at 300 °C to remove co-adsorbed water and volatile solvents also shows the presence of aromatic rings as indicated by the characteristic vibration bands appearing from 1700 to 1500 cm–1.
Method	Eqn. (1) shows the reaction employed for the synthesis of p-phenylene oligomers.
Result	This emission of p-tetraphenylene is compatible with the emission observed for the KY zeolite (shown in Fig. 2).
Problem	Phenylene oligomers have been prepared by ship-in-a-bottle synthesis inside palladium containing basic zeolites by homocoupling of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid.
Method	Recently we have supported palladium species on zeolites and used the resulting solids as heterogeneous catalysts for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling.6
Result	Product analysis and “in situ” IR spectroscopy support the formation of oligomers of three to five phenylene rings.
Background	Polyphenylene oligomers can exhibit intense electroluminescence2,3 and it would be of interest to study their properties when encapsulated within zeolites.
Method	4-Bromobiphenyl (1 mmol) and 4-biphenyl boronic acid (1.25 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL).
Method	The solid was dried under reduced pressure (10–1 bar) for 6 h.
Method	In this methodology, the required PdCl2 amount to achieve the target loading 1% (16 mg × g–1 of zeolite) of palladium in the support was dissolved in the volume corresponding to the pore of the support (1 mL) in order to fill all the voids of the solid without loss of metal.
Method	The reaction was carried out in toluene at 110° and its progress was monitored by observing in the liquid phase the formation of terphenylene and p-tetraphenylene derivatives.
Method	Given the experimental difficulty in performing quenching studies in solid samples, the nature of the transient generated upon laser flash photolysis on zeolites is generally addressed by comparing the optical spectrum recorded in zeolites with those obtained for the same compound in solution.1,8
Conclusion	Comparison of the laser flash photolysis spectrum of p-phenylene oligomers encapsulated within Y zeolite with the spectrum recorded for p-tetraphenyl has allowed assigning the transient to the corresponding triplet excited state.
Method	For the sake of comparison a sample of pure non-encapsulated PP was obtained using the same conditions as those for PP loaded PdCl2-KY, using PdCl2 (20 mol%) as palladium reagent and K2CO3 as base.
Method	In this case, ship-in-a-bottle methodologies have to be devised to achieve the in situ synthesis of the target guest.
Background	An alternative to the modification of the phenylene by substitution that would require more elaborated starting materials would be its incorporation inside the rigid framework of microporous hosts.
Method	In addition to the transient, fluorescence appearing at negative absorption at about 340 nm was also recorded at short times.

Background	The parameters were determined via comparison with the exact (calculated) correlation energy (in the traditional quantum chemistry definition) for several atoms (neutral and cationic), plus the experimental correlation energy of the helium atom.
Method	Although HF theory can yield a reasonable estimate of the induction contribution, HF theory cannot recover the dispersion energy.
Conclusion	It is clear that neither of these functionals can reliably yield binding for aromatic ring interactions at a qualitative level.
Background	Furthermore, they noted that, as expected, this intermolecular exchange contribution vanishes faster with respect to separation than r−6.
Background	Moreover, this study also showed that in all cases where binding was found, the interaction energy curve decayed to zero faster than r−6, clearly not capturing any long-range dispersion contribution (as expected).
Background	Some other correlation functionals also showed binding, but did not recover qualitatively correct equilibrium binding energies.
Method	For example, even with use of large basis sets, MP2 can substantially overestimate the attraction in weakly-bound aromatic systems.3
Problem	The Wilson–Levy (WL) correlation functional is used together with Hartree–Fock (HF) theory to evaluate interaction energies at intermediate separations (i.e. around equilibrium separation) for several weakly-bonded systems.
Conclusion	The absolute HF+WL interaction energy for the D2h structure deviates significantly from the ab initio value, although it is bound, and exhibits the smallest interaction energy of the set, in accord with Tsuzuki et al. Again, these data emphasise that HF+WL cannot outperform high-quality post-HF calculations.
Conclusion	The results of this work suggest an apparently promising device in the form of the EXXWL functional, for determining the energetic trends of molecules physisorbed on surfaces, nanotubes and other periodic structures.
Method	For the high-energy D2h structure, the optimum separation was taken from Tsuzuki et al.52
Result	For each basis set used (6-31G*, 6-31G*(0.25), aug-cc-pVXZ {X = D, T, Q}) the trend of interaction energies (A > G > H) was always followed.
Method	The four low-energy structures are shown in Fig. 3.
Result	Two newly-developed exchange–correlation functionals, designed for applications to biological systems (X3LYP and xPBE), were also investigated and found to perform not as well as the HF+WL approach.
Result	X3LYP is seen to perform similarly to xPBE for these systems.
Method	However, many studies have amply demonstrated that application of DFT to weakly-bound systems can not yield globally reliable estimates of the interaction energy even at intermediate intermonomer separations5–9 where there is overlap between fragments.
Result	The interaction energies of pyrimidine, uracil, cytosine and guanine were −3.1, −11.3, −10.3 and −14.0 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Problem	The final test system comprises the base-stacking interaction for dimers of pyrimidine, cytosine, uracil and guanine.
Result	The X3LYP data show binding only for structure A. Out to a separation of 6 Å, the other two structures were not bound using the X3LYP functional.
Method	One issue to note with both HF+D and DFT+D is that these methods require good quality dispersion coefficients.
Conclusion	These data demonstrate that the HF+WL approach captures the binding trends for these three structures, for all basis sets considered, while clearly not displaying quantitative accuracy.
Result	It is seen in Table 5 that the HF+WL separations all seem reasonable when compared with the ab initio data, although are consistently too short.
Method	Both of these functionals were coded into GAUSSIAN98, and satisfactorily verified against the published data for He2,36,37 Ne236,37 and Ar237 systems.
Method	However, the results of these studies do not show transferability of the scaling factor across different systems.
Background	Their data indicate that, compared with other correlation functionals used with B88, WL underestimates covalent bond lengths.
Method	Since it is difficult to disentangle the W38 functional from the WL functional, the WL functional is therefore not amenable to an analogous analysis of the ‘enhancement factor’.
Result	The only structure that yielded an interaction energy of less than +1 (but greater than zero) kcal mol−1, for either xPBE or X3LYP, was for the case when the distance along the vector connecting the two centre of mass points was extended by 0.2 Å.
Conclusion	For example, the location of the C2 structure of the naphthalene dimer was missed by several MP2-based geometry optimisation studies, presumably because of the low symmetry and the computational demands this creates.
Conclusion	It was found that this HF+WL approach works well in a pragmatic and qualitative sense for the energetics of closed-shell van der Waals systems, but without a satisfying physical justification, and without quantitative accuracy.
Method	In this case, the HF+WL interaction energies were calculated as a function of separation (along the vector that connects centre of mass points), while the relative orientations of each dimer structure were kept fixed.
Background	The interaction energy between two weakly-interacting fragments comprises many distinct and well-understood (although perhaps not easy to calculate) contributions.
Problem	The D3d structure has been identified by Tsuzuki and coworkers49 as the global minimum structure, at least at the MP3/aug(df,pd)-6-311G** level of theory.
Conclusion	The WL correlation potential has been examined, and appears to have unremarkable properties in comparison with other correlation potentials.
Problem	The basis set dependence of the HF+WL approach was also tested for the naphthalene dimer.
Background	This is opposed to the benzene dimer where the low-energy structures have favourable electrostatic interactions.
Result	For all systems but KrNe, the smaller basis set performed no worse than the aug-cc-pV5Z basis, in terms of capturing the correct trend.
Method	The geometries of these systems are shown in Fig. 4.
Background	Both of these ‘+dispersion’ approaches may succeed for the long-range part of the dispersion interaction, but it is not entirely clear that the DFT+D approach is correct in the overlapping regime.25
Problem	The SP structure was investigated in the neighbourhood of the structure of Tsuzuki et al., such that the vertical and horizontal separations, as well as the distance along the vector connecting the two centre of mass points, was varied by displacements of ±0.2 Å.
Method	For the methane dimer, three different relative orientations were examined, as shown in Fig. 2.
Method	This HF+DFT approach was shown by Pérez-Jordá etal26. to work very well for selected rare-gas dimers in the case where the Wilson–Levy correlation functional (WL)27 was used.
Problem	The Wilson–Levy (WL) correlation functional was used as a post-Hartree–Fock (HF) perturbative correction in the evaluation of the interaction energy for a range of weakly-bound dimers, in the regime of small to intermediate fragment separations.
Method	In general, all HF + dispersion methods are subject to this condition, which does limit the applicability of this type of approach.
Method	The WL correlation functional is based on the local Wigner correlation functional30 (W38).
Result	This behaviour is similar to that noted for other popular functionals.53
Problem	However, it appears possible that the HF+WL method can be extended such that all types of non-bonded system could be treated in future.
Problem	The D3d structure corresponds with isomer H, and the two D3h structures as isomers A and G, in the nomenclature of Tsuzuki et al.49
Problem	The stabilisation of stacked base-pairs is thought to arise from van der Waals interactions.57
Conclusion	These calculations confirmed what has been reported previously by Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 namely that the interaction energy decays to zero too rapidly compared with the r−6 decay observed with long-range London dispersion interactions.
Background	For comparison, the MP3 separations from Tsuzuki et. al. are 4.8, 3.8 and 3.8 Å for the A, G and H structures, respectively.
Method	The problem of calculating the short-range interaction energy can also be approached via the addition of a correlation contribution derived from DFT onto the total HF energy of the system, bearing in mind the deficiencies pointed out by Cybulski and Seversen.13
Method	Finally, it must be emphasised that, as demonstrated by Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 the HF+WL method has no pretensions to capturing London dispersion (the long-range contribution).
Result	The similarity between the PBE and PW91 results is also noted.
Problem	The X3LYP and xPBE functionals were also tested for all five naphthalene dimer structures.
Background	It appears that, at present, the lowest-energy structure corresponds to a crossed C2 geometry, with a slipped Ci structure also energetically competitive.44
Method	The LYP functional comprises a (local) W38 component multiplied by another functional that contains gradient correction terms.
Background	It has been recently suggested that both of these functionals should adequately describe non-bonded interactions for systems involving the first ten elements in the periodic table36,37.
Method	The monomer wavefunctions and energies were obtained in the full set of dimer basis functions, such that the interaction energies were corrected for basis-set superposition error (BSSE) via the counterpoise correction39 (CP).
Conclusion	It is also noted that the HF+WL approach appeared to work reliably only when a basis set featuring at least split-valence plus diffuse functions was used.
Result	The D2h was checked instead using both the 6-31+G* and 6-311G* basis sets, with both yielding binding, optimised at −1.07 kcal mol−1 and −1.80 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Result	Also shown in Table 4 for comparison are results from full DFT calculations, as reported by Tsuzuki and Lüthi51 and also from current work, that confirm the unsuitability of these functionals as applied to weakly-bound systems.
Result	However, the disagreement for HeNe is striking – the 6-31G* basis recovering an interaction energy of only −5.5 K. The optimum seperation was increased (to 7.0 a0).
Conclusion	Another example is the geometry optimisation of small molecules adsorbed onto periodic substrates.
Result	In agreement with the previous findings of Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 the trend of the well depths presented here are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental results, while not being quantitatively accurate.
Result	Examination of these data plus the data of Pérez-Jordá et al26. show that, with the exception of dimers containing helium, the HF+WL underestimates the interaction energy.
Conclusion	It is clear from all of the test cases examined that the HF+WL approach is capable of recovering qualitative trends in interaction energies for pure van der Waals (dispersion and repulsion) systems, albeit with shorter equilibrium distances (most of the time).
Conclusion	Thus, while admittedly not having a satisfying and physically rigorous theoretical justification, the HF+WL approach (or in future, the EXXWL functional) may become a useful pragmatic device for optimising the geometries of large and/or complicated van der Waals complexes that are currently beyond the reach of optimisation by more sophisticated ab initio methods.
Problem	The basis set dependence of the the HF+WL approach was also gauged for the benzene dimer structures.
Result	The trend in energetics for the D2d, Ci and C2h structures agrees with the best estimates, although there is not quantitative agreement.
Result	Every structure was bound for both functionals, although the attraction is decreased in comparison with the data of Hobza and Šponer.
Method	In the worst case, the use of post-HF methods such as MP2 or CCSD(T) can be limited at best to rather modest basis set sizes.
Background	However, it has been remarked by others64 that perhaps a more realistic asymptotic behaviour of the correlation potential would be −α/r4, where α is the polarizability.
Problem	The naphthalene dimer presents a significant challenge in the calculation of competitive low-energy structures.
Conclusion	However, these data also suggest that failure to recover long-range London dispersion does not preclude a DFT-based methodology from recovering binding at distances where fragments do overlap.
Background	On the basis of Heitler–London calculations, Cybulski and Seversen13 correctly identified that the correlation functionals used in their study only showed binding when it was due to exchange effects from the correlation functional, such that the total intermolecular exchange was negative (for their decomposition scheme).
Background	This HF+DFT approach is not the same as Hartree–Fock Kohn–Sham (HFKS) theory, but Pérez-Jordá et al26. reported that the HF+DFT results for rare-gas dimers were almost identical to the HFKS results.
Conclusion	The second limitation is on the type of system that can be studied with this method (the same restrictions apply to HF+D methods), and is a consequence of how the correlation contribution forms a perturbative correction to the total Hartree–Fock energy.
Result	The trend in the interaction energies is reproduced, although the absolute values appear fortuitously close to the best estimates.
Method	The geometries used for the base-pair calculations can be found in Fig. 4.
Background	Therefore, an investigation of systems where there is less similarity between HF and real densities is, at present, desirable.
Problem	This was done to confirm the dependence of the interaction energy on overlap, for short- to medium-range separations.
Background	Their data, shown in Fig. 1, emphatically reinforces their statement.
Method	Also, the form of the damping function, including anisotropic damping, can be a very important factor in gaining good results from these DFT+D models.
Problem	The interaction energy as a function of centre-of-mass separation was also investigated for these two functionals.
Background	Second-order contributions to the interaction energy arise from electronic correlation effects (beyond electron exchange alone).
Method	Density-functional theory (DFT) is often proposed as a means of obtaining the correlation contribution to the total electronic energy, in a way that is computationally economical.
Method	Following Hobza and Šponer, the uracil dimer geometry was optimised in this work at the MP2/6-31G** level, and agrees closely with the structural data of Hobza and Šponer.46
Background	The performance of WL correlation for covalent bonds has not been as extensively tested.
Method	The HF+WL interaction energy was calculated as a function of separation in all cases, and the minimum interaction energy was reported in each case.
Method	Empirical scaling of DFT exchange has also been examined by several groups,14,16,17 with a view to correcting this problem.
Method	However, this caveat does not necessarily exclude the HF+WL method yielding binding when there is overlap between fragments, crucially, around the equilibrium separation for many weakly-interacting systems.
Conclusion	Relative orientations seemed to be captured well for the HF+WL approach.
Result	The HF+WL/6-31+G* also yields reasonable results for the low-energy structures, giving interaction energies of −5.83, −4.14, −5.75 and −4.86 kcal mol−1 for the C2, D2d, Ci and C2h structures respectively.
Conclusion	Furthermore, these conclusions only hold at separations where the charge distribution on each fragment overlaps.
Background	Methods based on exact exchange, such as the optimised effective potential (OEP),35 the KLI approximation,59 and more recently, the localised HF approach60 and the direct optimisation method,61 will also ensure that the intermolecular exchange behaves as HF exchange.
Conclusion	The fully self-consistent EXXWL functional would allow treatment of systems where a general HF+D approach currently fails (such as the NaAr complex, molecular physisorption on metal surfaces, etc)., where the HF wavefunction cannot distort if dynamic correlation effects are not accounted for.
Background	Two clear limitations of these current calculations are acknowledged.
Background	Tsuzuki et al. did not examine the C2 structure, so we have made comparisons with the trend from the HF+D results of Gonzalez and Lim.24
Result	The minimum energy separation is consistently underestimated by not more than 0.5 a0, as is also demonstrated in the results of Pérez-Jordá et al. The HF+WL approach has not captured the slight contraction in separation in going from KrHe to KrNe.
Method	Both induction and dispersion are present in the regime of large fragment separations (the ‘long-range’ form) where the charge distributions on each fragment do not overlap, and are also present in the small to intermediate separation regime (the ‘short-range’ form) where the charge distributions do overlap.
Conclusion	This limitation could be lifted if the WL correlation could be included dynamically, within Kohn–Sham DFT, via the implementation of exact-exchange methods (denoted here as the proposed EXXWL functional).
Conclusion	It is similar to other correlation potentials, e.g. the Perdew(86)63 correlation functional, in the sense that the potential decays to the asymptotic limit exponentially.
Method	Using this MP2 structure, the separation (along the vector connecting the centre of mass of each molecule) was optimised using HF+WL, while keeping the angle of the monomer normal vectors (normal to the ring plane) constant.
Conclusion	As will be confirmed with some of the other systems, the overlap obtained using the 6-31G* basis appears insufficient to ensure confident use of HF+WL here.
Result	The performance was very similar at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Result	Again, the D6h (F) structure provides a probe of the HF+WL method away from the two low-energy structures.
Result	The corresponding optimised separations at the HF+WL/6-31G* level were 3.4, 2.97, 3.1 and 3.0 Å, respectively.
Conclusion	To quantify the conditions under which this approach appears to be of value it is noted that, for example, in the case of the rare gas dimers, the HF+WL approach yields reasonable results for systems with overlaps no smaller than around 10−5 (with the exception of the helium dimer).
Conclusion	The utility of HF+WL, with reference to exact-exchange (EXX) density-functional theory, is discussed in terms of a suggested EXXWL exchange–correlation functional.
Problem	Furthermore, since the HF+WL method used here is an ad hoc post-Hartree–Fock correction (and not variationally obtained), this will cause further problems when seeking monotonically decreasing behaviour of interaction energies as a function of basis-set size.
Conclusion	Of course, there is no way that the WL correlation functional can provide a realistic description of London dispersion interactions at long range.
Background	The pyrimidine system has been best characterised, at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ(+f functions and bond functions) level of theory,45 but only at one geometry (see Fig. 4) with the vertical separation fixed to 3.3 Å.
Method	Therefore, in this article, the general phrase ‘dispersion energy’ does not solely refer to the London dispersion (with r−6 dependence) that characterises the long-range contribution, rather, it refers to the dispersion interaction at all separations.
Method	Unfortunately, the WL functional is not multiplicatively separable in this sense from the W38 functional.
Background	Wilson and Levy point out that, due to the way in which the functional was parametrised, it may not perform well for systems where the Hartree–Fock density differs substantially from the true density.
Result	Also in contrast with the rare-gas systems, the isomers studied here showed little sensitivity to changes in basis set using the HF+WL approach.
Background	Such an EXXWL functional is not intended to act as a replacement for more accurate post-HF methods, but rather as a device for optimising the structure and energetics of weakly-bonded systems that are not amenable even to MP2 optimisations.
Problem	Isomers A and G are other low-energy structures, and therefore these two geometries probe the interaction energy in regions of configuration space away from the global minimum.
Method	The vertical separation (for the fixed optimum twist angle) was then optimised for this structure using HF+WL.
Result	Although the xPBE data show binding for each structure, and also that the trend of the interaction energies seems correct (A > G > H), the binding is reduced compared with the MP3 results (except in the case of isomer A).
Problem	It is the applicability of this approach as a pragmatic device that will be further explored in this work.
Result	For both of these functionals, none of the five structures were bound, out to a centre-of-mass separation of 6.0 Å.
Conclusion	Compelling reasons for why the WL functional works so well in the cases studied here remain unclear.
Result	The range of xPBE interaction energies is significantly compressedwith respect to the MP3 data.
Background	Despite these well-known deficiencies of DFT, a number of schemes for empirically correcting DFT calculations by addition of damped dispersion (DFT+D) have been proposed.6,18–20
Result	For the xPBE functional, at a 6.0 Å separation, interaction energies were 0.19, 0.12, 0.72, 0.06 and 0.23 kcal mol−1 for the D2d, C2, C2h, Ci and D2h structures, respectively.
Method	As an alternative to post-HF theories and also DFT+D, another route to gaining economical (and reasonable) estimates of the interaction energy for large weakly-bound systems is to use a Hartree–Fock (HF) plus dispersion approach (HF+D).
Background	Following Stone,1 the interaction energy can be decomposed into first-order, second-order and higher-order contributions.
Result	Again, the HF+WL approach underestimates the minimum-energy separation, found to be 4.6, 3.5 and 3.4 Å for the A, G and H structures, respectively.
Method	For a given arrangement of rigid monomers, the HF wavefunction was converged and the total electronic energy (EHF) obtained, for both the complex, and also for each monomer in the complex.
Result	While the T and SP structures remained bound (interaction energies of −2.83 kcal mol−1 and −1.85 kcal mol−1, respectively), the F structure is unbound at this level of theory, at +0.78 kcal mol−1.
Method	For each low-energy structure, the separations were varied with displacements of ±0.2 Å away (along the vector connecting the centre ofmass points) from the optimum separation (as was determined by MP2/6-31G* geometry optimizations.44)
Conclusion	This behaviour is reasonable in the sense that the correlation potential should decay faster than the exchange potential (in the case of the HF potential, the asymptotic decay goes like −1/r).
Method	The correlation energy was then evaluated using the corresponding HF density.
Method	WL was parametrised from high-quality quantum chemical data for a small number of atoms.
Problem	Specifically, it is conjectured that use of the WL correlation functional, applied self-consistently in conjunction with exact-exchange DFT (e.g. the optimised effective potential, OEP35), denoted here as the EXXWL functional, should have a performance similar to the HF+WL approach.
Background	This result has also been reported by Gonzalez and Lim, using a HF+D approach.24
Conclusion	In contrast, the X3LYP and xPBE data seem less reliable here.
Background	The HF+WL method should essentially be regarded as an empirical correction to the HF interaction energy, and presumably has inherent deficiencies with the description of intermolecular exchange.
Problem	It also, by design, should work well with Hartree–Fock densities.
Method	The monomers were treated as rigid bodies throughout.
Result	This appeared to give satisfactory results for the four low-energy structures–yielding −4.77, −3.10, −4.70 and −3.93 kcal mol−1 for the C2, D2d, Ci and C2h structures, respectively.
Background	Most published theoretical studies of the naphthalene dimer have made use of MP2 calculations.44,52,54–56
Background	For the remaining systems (fixed at the geometries in Fig. 4) examined by Hobza and Šponer, uracil was characterised up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(+ bond functions) level, cytosine up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ leveland guanine up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Result	None of these locally-perturbed structures showed binding at the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Result	The PW91 data fortuitously coincides with the HeKr and NeKr points, while the PBE data fortuitously coincides with the ArKr and Kr2 points.
Background	Furthermore, promising developments of inclusion of ‘left–right’ correlation with exact exchange within the KS-DFT framework62 suggest that an approach that combines non-dynamical correlation with the EXXWL functional may in future permit reasonable modelling of bond-breaking in weakly-bonded systems.
Method	Where charge distributions overlap, second-order contributions are modified by general overlap effects as well as electron exchange, leading to damped induction, exchange-induction, damped dispersion and exchange–dispersion contributions.
Background	An accurate description of exchange under such conditions is vital for describing weakly-bonded systems.
Background	This overlap effect has been observed (but not quantified) by others, e.g. see .ref. 7
Result	The results are summarised in Table 6.
Result	It is interesting to note that the lowest-energy separation for pyrimidine is larger than the separation estimated by Hobza and Šponer.
Result	The T structure was bound at a separation of 5.7 Å at the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ level, with an optimum interaction energy of −0.48 kcal mol−1.
Result	The minimum energy separations and interaction energies for the three benzene dimer structures, calculated at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
Method	The interaction energy was calculated using the supermolecule method, in the following way:The performance of two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP36 and xPBE,37 was also investigated here, in the case of the molecular dimers.
Background	Since the WL correlation functional was designed for use with HF densities, it may be an appropriate approximate correlation functional to use with exact exchange methods, at least for studying pure van der Waals interactions.
Method	It is noted that, in general, any perturbative correction to the HF interaction energy should only hold under conditions such that the HF wavefunction will not substantially distort if (some) second-order effects are dynamically included.
Result	The agreement with the best energetic estimates from Hobza and Šponer is good for all cases.
Conclusion	These results re-emphasise that weak interactions for non-overlapping fragments cannot be captured by the HF+WL approach.
Background	A decomposition scheme based on Heitler–London type calculations, as reported by Cybulski and Seversen,13 may be helpful in this instance.
Method	At first the 6-31G* basis was used.
Conclusion	However, no claim is made to suggest that the HF+WL approach can describe a pure van der Waals system with quantitative accuracy, and therefore is not competitive with post-Hartree–Fock methodologies.
Problem	Here, four low-energy structures (Fig. 3) and one high-energy structure are considered.
Method	The integration was done over a pruned grid with 99 radial shells and 590 angular points per shell.
Background	Therefore, the fact that mainstream DFT cannot recover short-range second-order contributions must be due, in part, to problems with the exchange functional.
Background	While some studies have reported progress in this area,18,19 further studies into damping are probably warranted.
Method	The aug-cc-pVTZ basis was used here for HF+WL, X3LYP and xPBE.
Result	The F structure was unbound at all separations up to and including 6.0 Å at both the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ and X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ levels.
Method	The quadrature used here ensured that the correlation energy was converged to within 1–2 μEh per atom (depending on atom type).
Result	Table 4 shows the interaction energy of the T, F and SP structures calculated at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory, at the geometries taken from Tsuzuki et al.,50 revealing a similar performance of these two functionals compared with existing functionals.
Method	Again, the vertical separation between monomers was optimised to yield the optimum interaction energy in each case.
Conclusion	Neither can be said to describe rare-gas equilibrium interaction energies satisfactorily, while the HF+WL equilibrium interaction energies follow the trend of the Ogilvie and Wang data relatively closely.
Background	In addition, several correlation functionals did not yield any attractive contributions, notably the VWN28 and Perdew–Wang29 correlation functionals.
Method	Some comments on the choice of example systems studied here are warranted.
Background	Calculations at the MP2 level tend to overestimate the attraction in the naphthalene dimer, most significantly for the structures lowest in energy.52
Background	In this by work of Hobza and Šponer,45 the vertical separation of cytosine and guanine dimers were fixed at 3.3 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively, and the uracil dimer geometry came from geometry optimisation at the MP2/6-31G** level.
Result	This behaviour in stark contrast with the behaviour noted for the D2h isomer of the naphthalene dimer, and the F structure of the benzene dimer, both of which were unbound at the HF+WL/6-31G* level.
Background	This approach will herein be referred to as HF+WL.
Result	Exploration of the interaction energy of the F structure at a range of separations confirmed that this structure remained unbound.
Method	The HF+D approach was first introduced by Hepburn etal.,21 has been successfully applied to small weakly-bound systems,22 and recently Lim and coworkers have applied HF+D to small clusters of polyaromatic heterocycles to good effect.23,24
Background	Finally, it is plausible that the WL functional yields unphysical attractive contributions for some of the short-ranged contributions to the interaction energy.
Background	Such interactions are ubiquitous in Nature, and should be described properly by any theory that claims to model ‘biological systems’.
Result	The calculated well-depths and minimum energy separations, obtained using the aug-cc-pV5Z basis, for Kr2, HeKr, NeKr and ArKr are presented in Table 1, along with reference values from Ogilvie and Wang,47,48 and other DFT values from Patton and Pederson.9
Method	Optimised naphthalene dimer geometries were taken from previous work.44
Method	That is, antiparallel undisplaced structures were used for the pyrimidine and cytosine dimers, and the vertical displacement was optimised using HF+WL.
Problem	Three structures of the methane dimer were studied, as shown in Fig. 2; one D3d structure and two D3h structures.
Conclusion	The HF+WL/6-31G* level was demonstrated to be insufficient in several instances.
Background	Low-symmetry structures can be very time-consuming to optimise at any post-HF level (with a sufficiently large basis set), although advances are being made in this area (e.g. see .ref. 4)
Result	The F structure is bound in the HF+WL model, but underestimates the attraction, again emphasising that the HF+WL method cannot compete with post-HF approaches.
Result	The interaction energies are also plotted in Fig. 1.
Method	Therefore, the method has been tested on systems where dynamic inclusion of such effects would not substantially distort the wavefunction, compared with the HF wavefunction.
Conclusion	Even if the origins of this unphysical behaviour can be revealed, further work is required to understand why these (potentially) unphysical terms combine such that very good interaction energies are ultimately recovered, albeit fortuitously.
Conclusion	The fact that the HF+WL almost always underestimates monomer separations seems consistent with this idea.
Method	The EXXWL functional would open up possibilities for qualitatively accurate calculations on complex systems not yet accessible by other methodologies, e.g. physisorption onto nanotubes, gas–surface interactions, etc.
Result	The X3LYP values showed a similar trend, with absolute interaction energies slightly higher in all cases.
Background	Chermette et al33. reported self-consistent KS-DFT optimisations of the CO and N2O molecules, using the B88 exchange functional34 with WL correlation.
Problem	Exact exchange and Wilson–Levy correlation: a pragmatic device for studying complex weakly-bonded systems
Problem	The basis set dependence of the HF+WL energies was examined.
Conclusion	Clearly the HF+WL approach is not perfect here – but it is outperforming other DFT-based approaches.
Background	Accurate calculation of these second-order contributions, at any separation, for large and/or complex weakly-interacting systems remains a challenging prospect in theoretical chemistry.
Result	Similarly, at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level, the T structure was bound at an optimum distance of 5.6 Å with an interaction energy of −0.37 kcal mol−1.
Method	However, it is now well-known that no mainstream, practical correlation functional can recover the r−6 dependence of London dispersion at large fragment separations (see for example refs. 7 and 25, and references therein).
Background	The WL correlation functional is based on the Wigner correlation functional30 (W38), contains gradient corrections, and includes four empirically-determined parameters.
Method	In all cases, a range of basis sets, chosen from 6-31G*, 6-31G*(0.25),40 6-311G*, 6-31 + G* and the aug-cc-pVXZ41–43 {X = D, T, Q, 5} family were used.
Problem	These HF+WL results will be compared with results obtained using several established mainstream functionals (e.g. B3LYP and PBE), as well as two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP36 and xPBE.37
Method	The WL correlation energy (Ecorr) was then extracted from the calculation for both the complex and individual monomers (again using the CP correction).
Method	This is in common with many exchange functionals that analogously comprise the Dirac (local) exchange, multiplied by another functional that contains gradient correction terms.
Method	Hartree–Fock (HF) theory adequately captures (at small and large separations) first-order contributions such as the electrostatic interaction and the exchange–repulsion interaction.
Method	This separation was varied along the vector connecting the centre of mass points in the same way.
Result	Furthermore, the separation corresponding to the optimum interaction energy is increased relative to the results from Hobza and Šponer. xPBE manages to capture the trend of the interaction energies, although as already observed for the methane dimer, the range of interaction energies is considerably smaller than is seen in the ab initio results.
Method	Functionals of a form such as this lend themselves easily to an analysis in the low-density/high-density-gradient regime, since one can construct an ‘enhancement factor’ (the function that is multiplied by the local component of the functional).
Conclusion	This confirms the necessity for using at least split-valence plus diffuse functions in the basis set when using HF+WL.
Method	Higher-order terms are recovered (with varying degrees of accuracy) via use of post-HF methods such as Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory, MP2, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with triples corrections, CCSD(T).
Background	Compared with the HF+WL approach, a much wider range of systems could be treated with the EXXWL functional.
Background	However, these systems should only be studied within a fully self-consistent implementation of the EXXWL functional.
Conclusion	The HF+WL approach provides a reasonable estimate of the energetic and structural trends of this system (while not being quantitatively accurate), where full DFT can not.
Background	These data were obtained using their extrapolation method where the interaction energy is calculated at the MP2 basis set limit plus a CCSD(T) correction evaluated with a large basis set.
Method	All calculations in this work were done using GAUSSIAN.9838
Result	In particular, the best estimates indicate that the D2d and C2h structures are almost isoenergetic, while the HF+WL data support a difference of over 0.5 kcal mol−1.
Method	As in the HF+D approach, the exchange contribution should behave correctly at long range.
Method	However, recent progress in the development of algorithms for the rapid evaluation of MP2 energies and gradients (e.g. see Saebø et al4)., should in future enable practical geometry optimisations using larger basis sets.
Method	The interaction energy for each system was also calculated for separations beyond the minimum-energy point.
Method	Systems exhibiting pure van der Waals interactions (dispersion and repulsion) are ideal in this case, and the systems chosen here reflect this.
Background	Hartree–Fock densities of these atoms were used in the parametrisation of this functional.
Problem	Here, the HF+WL approach is applied to all homoatomic and heteroatomic rare-gas dimers RgKr {Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr}, the methane dimer, benzene dimer, naphthalene dimer and also DNA base-pair stacking interactions.
Background	Finally, by way of comparison with other empirically-corrected methods, Wu et al6. report a DFT + disp interaction energy for the SP structure (at the Tsuzuki et al50. geometry) of −3.99 kcal mol−1.
Problem	These systems were also investigated using the xPBE and X3LYP functionals, both with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.
Background	While it is often the correlation functional which is identified as deficient in recovering second-order contributions in the overlapping regime, several studies have instead identified the exchange functional as problematic,6,8,13–16 especially under the conditions of low-density/high-density-gradient.
Conclusion	However, the intramolecular degrees of freedom could in principle be optimised using the HF+WL approach.
Conclusion	Fig. 1 also re-emphasises the point made by others that the PW91 and PBE functionals do not show great variation in energy between each rare-gas dimer system.
Method	Similarly, diffuse functions were added to the 6-31G* basis, such that the 6-31+G* basis set was considered.
Conclusion	The HF+WL approach cannot be successfully applied in the large separation regime.
Background	In other words, for the naphthalene dimer, fortuitous location of the low-energy structures, by virtue of attractive electrostatic interactions, is not possible, making this system an excellent test case for new functionals.
Conclusion	These results, as well as those summarised in Table 4, demonstrate that the recovery of binding for molecular complexes, even at separations where the fragments overlap, remains an elusive goal for mainstream DFT exchange–correlation functionals.
Background	For comparison, the data of Tsuzuki et al50. are shown.
Problem	The interaction energy as calculated here by the supermolecule method is of course not variational, so we do not necessarily expect to see convergence of this energy from above.
Result	The minimum energy separations and interaction energies for these four systems, calculated at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, are reported in Table 6, as are ab initio data obtained by Hobza and Šponer.45
Method	For the naphthalene dimer, four low-energy structures and one high-energy structure were examined: two crossed structures (D2d and C2 symmetries) and two slipped-parallel structures (C2h and Ci symmetries), and one undisplaced parallel structure (D2h).
Conclusion	As shown in Fig. 1, the qualitative agreement found using HF+WL clearly exceeds the performance of any other mainstream DFT approach (demonstrated, for example, in the results of Patton and Pederson.9)
Result	At this level, all structures are bound, with F, T and SP structures having interaction energies −0.20, −3.08 and −2.58 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Conclusion	These data suggest that a basis with at least split valence plus diffuse and polarization functions, or triple split valence plus polarization should be used to obtain qualitatively correct HF+WL interaction energies.
Result	The optimum interaction energies and centre-of-mass separations are summarised in Table 5, with the MP2 (CCSD(T)-corrected) data of Tsuzuki et al52. presented for comparison, along with the HF+D data of Gonzalez and Lim.24
Method	The LYP correlation functional,65 due to its basis on the Colle–Salvetti formula, is also based on the form of the W38 functional.
Result	Separations and interaction energies for these three structures, calculated using the HF+WL method, as well as the X3LYP and xPBE functionals, are shown in Table 2, along with the ab initio data of Tsuzuki et al.49
Result	The HF+WL approach reproduces binding trends for all complexes studied: selected rare-gas dimers, isomers of the methane dimer, benzene dimer and naphthalene dimer, and base-pair stacking structures for pyrimidine, cytosine, uracil and guanine dimers.
Method	The basis set dependence was also checked for the smaller 6-31G* basis.
Method	For the benzene dimer, three geometries were considered: a T-shaped structure (C2v symmetry), a slipped-parallel (SP) structure (C2h symmetry) and an undisplaced parallel (F) structure (D6h symmetry), also shown in Fig. 2.
Conclusion	It seems clear that the energy has converged by the aug-cc-pVTZ basis, and that the aug-cc-pVDZ basis still follows a reasonable qualitative trend (especially when compared with the PBE and PW91 data), although the trend for HeKr and NeKr is not captured.
Conclusion	For these functionals, of those structures that showed any binding at all, the binding was substantially underestimated compared with best estimates from ab initio calculations.
Method	These methods may yield unreliable results for such small basis sets.
Background	It is worth mentioning that even W38 (without gradient corrections) in partnership with Becke8834 exchange (the B-W functional)66 has been shown to perform comparably with BLYP, although the reasons for this also remain unclear.
Background	Because of the constraints imposed by the HF+D-like approach used here, the systems chosen for study should have HF densities that are reasonably close to the true density.
Background	The decomposition analysis used by Cybulski and Seversen, while helpfully demonstrating the overlap effect of binding for some correlation functionals, does not explain why these correlation functionals yield negative contributions to the intermolecular exchange.
Method	This fact will not be disputed here; lack of London dispersion remains a major limitation of all approaches that involve Kohn–Sham DFT in some way.
Background	Work is currently underway to enable calculations with the EXXWL functional in future.
Result	This result confirms the behaviour of the HF+WL/6-31G* level as noted for the benzene dimer calculations.
Result	At the HF+WL/6-311G* level, the T and SP structures also remained with reasonable interaction energies (−3.16 and −2.84 kcal mol−1, respectively).
Result	Increasing flexibility by using a triple split valence basis, in this case using 6-311G*, leads to binding of the F structure (−0.53 kcal mol−1).
Method	Unless otherwise stated, the monomer structures were fully optimised at the MP2/6-31G** level of theory.
Method	Finally, for the base-pair stacking dimers, the geometries were taken from Hobza and Šponer.45
Background	Several studies have reported low-energy structures of the naphthalene dimer using MP2 calculations with a range of basis sets,44,52,54,55 including correlation corrections to MP2 interaction energies, using CCSD(T) calculations.52
Result	At this level of theory, the D2h was not bound for any separation.
Conclusion	It is also clear that the current group of exchange–correlation functionals, B3LYP, PBE, X3LYP and xPBE, cannot be reliably used even for qualitative work.
Background	The ab initio data of Hobza and Šponer are the best estimates (obtained using an extrapolation procedure involving MP2 complete basis set data with CCSD(T) corrections) available at present.
Problem	The example systems selected in this work examine aromatic ring interactions.
Result	The interaction energies, although overestimated for the T and SP structures, still show a reasonable trend compared with the F structure, although the T and SP structures are not isoenergetic as suggested in the results of the ab initio calculations.
Problem	These HF+WL data are contrasted against results obtained from some popular functionals (including B3LYP and PBE), as well as two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP and xPBE.
Conclusion	Other functionals, including those that are claimed to describe weak interactions such as xPBE and X3LYP, while also not capable of recovering London dispersion, cannot reliably perform the role of a pragmatic device, even when monomer charge distributions overlap.
Method	At the minimum-energy separations found at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, the interaction energies were recalculated using the 6-31G* basis set.
Background	Full CCSD(T) calculations with any reasonable basis set are currently out of reach, at least for the low symmetry structures.
Background	Accordingly, with the exception of LDA, most functionals will incorrectly predict that the T structures (T1 and T2 as shown in ref. 44) are the lowest in energy (no isomers are bound using PW91 and B3LYP).53
Conclusion	The results of HF+WL optimisations would at least indicate which of the structures should be considered for further refinement by more expensive post-HF methods.
Result	The results with the 6-31G* basis do not show much difference with the data obtained with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis.
Background	Application of DFT to this system is also particularly unsuitable: the high-energy structures have attractive electrostatic energy contributions and relatively small dispersion contributions, and the low-energy structures have electrostatic contributions that are less favourable, while having relatively large dispersion contributions.44,52
Method	The use of HF implies that, for a given density, the exchange contribution will be exact (by definition), including under low-density/high-density-gradient conditions.
Method	The guanine dimer structure was an undisplaced stacked geometry, where one monomer was rotated clockwise about its centre of mass (in the plane of the molecule).
Conclusion	The first is that for all the systems studied here, the monomers were treated as rigid body fragments.
Problem	A HF+WL-type of approach may be extremely useful for optimising geometries of low-symmetry structures.
Method	Several groups have made progress in the development of ‘seamless DFT’ approaches that can describe dispersion contributions at all separations10–12 (including in the overlapping regime).
Background	Periodic EXX calculations are now possible via some mainstream plane-wave codes, making EXXWL presumably more efficient than currently available periodic MP2 implementations (as found in GAUSSIAN03).
Background	As noted by Wilson and Levy,27 since the traditional quantum chemistry definition of correlation energy is not always equivalent to the DFT definition, the WL functional may not be successful if applied to systems where the HF density is substantially different to the true density of the system.
Problem	The basis set dependency was again explored by repeating these calculations at the HF+WL/6-31G* level.
Conclusion	The performance of all of the functionals examined here is poor in comparison with the HF+WL approach.
Method	Compared with pyrimidine and cytosine, the procedure for creating the input structures for uracil and guanine was a little different.
Result	The optimum twist angle was identified at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, for a fixed vertical separation of 3.4 Å.
Method	These short-range terms should behave as a function of overlap between fragments.
Conclusion	It must be re-emphasised that, as a general rule, it appears that HF+WL calculations must be used with at least split-valence plus diffuse functions in order to capture qualitative behaviour.
Background	Gonzalez and Lim24 report a HF + disp interaction energy of the T structure (at the geometry used by Tsuzuki et al50). of −2.80 kcal mol−1, albeit with a rather modest basis for the HF component.
Background	In particular, these authors demonstrated that the Wilson–Levy correlation functional (WL)27 worked extremely well in partnership with HF theory, in reproducing the experimental well-depths of the rare-gas dimer systems studied “with remarkable agreement”.
Result	All other separations obtained using the HF+WL approach are, as expected, underestimated.
Background	These systems have been the subject of studies using MP2,45 CCSD(T),45 empirically-corrected DFT16,18,58 and HF+D calculations.58
Method	However, all of these approaches are at present too computationally intensive to be applied to large and/or complex weakly-bonded systems.
Result	For each basis the separation between atoms was optimised, but in most cases did not change appreciably for the different basis sets.
Background	The reader is directed to the body of work concerned with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), where such contributions to the interaction energy are rigorously defined (e.g., the review article of Jeziorski et al2)..
Problem	Having accepted the caveats of HF+WL, the utility of this approach as a pragmatic device for locating low-energy structures of large van der Waals systems (some of which have low symmetry) in a simple and quick way will be demonstrated.
Result	The interaction energies of these rare-gas systems, calculated using HF+WL for a range of basis sets aug-cc-pVXZ {X = D, T, Q, 5} is shown in Fig. 5.
Background	However, the utility of this functional has principally been demonstrated only as a post-HF correction8,31,32 for atoms and molecules, not as a dynamic correlation contribution that is self-consistently evaluated.
Method	The performance of HF theory for second-order contributions is less comprehensive.
Conclusion	In agreement with their findings, and with previous MP2 optimisations,44 the HF+WL approach also supports the C2 structure as the putative global minimum for the naphthalene dimer system.
Result	Again, it can be seen that the HF+WL separations are underestimated compared with the best estimate data.
