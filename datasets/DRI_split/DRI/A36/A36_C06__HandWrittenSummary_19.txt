The scope of this paper is to provide an innovative method of tuning cloth deformation models by introducing a novel system of observing cloth properties and a new method for fitting parametric cloth models. The proposed measurement system is able to capture 3D cloth deformation and the respective applied forces as they change during a range of different deformations. Constitutive cloth deformation models are evaluated in terms of their fidelity to predict forces in response to cloth deformations. Estimation of a model accuracy is derived by the fitting residual between the model predictions and the actual measurements of cloth deformation i.e. stretch, shear and bending, both in position and forces. A new general method of fitting the model to measurement data is presented which results in solving an optimisation problem. Model parameters estimation is done incrementally, under a sequence of deformations of increasing complexity, so that convergence to be achieved despite the presence of local minima. Experiments on current cloth models are made in order to evaluate the performance and limitations of fitted models under various conditions.
