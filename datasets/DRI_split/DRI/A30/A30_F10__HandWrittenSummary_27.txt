We carefully generate pressure sample points near the liquid surface, build a Voronoi simulation mesh from these points and a background lattice, and apply a ghost fluid/finite volume pressure discretization which captures the precise position of the liquid interface. In summary, our key contribution is coupling an explicit surface tracker to a Voronoi-based liquid simulator with: • a pressure sample placement strategy that captures the complete liquid surface geometry, • an accurate surface tension model combining mesh-based curvature estimates and ghost fluid boundary conditions, • embedded free surface and solid boundary conditions adapted to Voronoi cells, avoiding the need for more onerous conforming tetrahedral mesh generation, • and a new velocity interpolant over unstructured meshes. The practical benefits of such a system include: • improved animation of detailed liquid features, including very thin sheets, tendrils and droplets, • elimination of noise in explicit surface tracking without nonphysical smoothing, • more detailed and less damped surface tension effects, • and faster semi-Lagrangian advection on unstructured meshes without increased dissipation. The main contribution of this paper is the coupling of simulation elements to an existing explicit surface tracking method, and not the explicit surface tracking itself. We have shown that with careful placement of pressure samples, our Voronoi mesh-based fluid solver makes it possible for explicit surface tracking to achieve its full potential in capturing small scale liquid features.
