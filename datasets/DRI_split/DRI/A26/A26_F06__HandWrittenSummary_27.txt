We propose an algorithm for the interactive simulation of fluid motion that avoids many of the shortcomings of existing techniques. Our method allows considerable flexibility in choosing the basis dimensionality.  Due to orthogonality of the basis and its correspondence with vorticity of varying scales, we have a unique mechanism for spectral energy control. We have described many of its unique properties and its use as a practical means of fluid simulation for computer graphics. The orthogonality of the basis functions and their correspondence to a spectrum of vorticity scales enables energy control at varying turbulent scales. We have used this property to enforce stability of integrators and simulate physical viscosity. Flexibility in choosing basis dimensionality and the ability to integrate directly in a space of basis coefficients permits computational efficiency, enabling interactive performance. The existence of closed form solutions for simple domains allows symbolic evaluation of the advection operator and the ability to sparsely evaluate velocities on demand. We have demonstrated some of the useful properties of our method, but many exciting avenues remain to be explored. We plan to investigate its use for the the expressive control of fluid motion, such as spectral energy control and space time optimization. We also believe there is potential for our method to be exploited in other research areas such as medical imaging and inverse flow modelling.
