In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for composing specialist controllers into more general and capable control systems for dynamic characters.  It has presented a methodology for ameliorating the problem with a framework which facilitates the exchange and composition of controllers.

In our framework, individual controllers are black boxes encapsulating control knowledge that is possibly gleaned from the biomechanics literature, derived from the robotics control literature, or developed specifically for animation control.  We demonstrate controller composition with pre-conditions determined not only manually but also automatically based on support vector machine (SVM) learning theory.  At the heart of our prototype system is a composite controller that is capable of handling a large number of everyday tasks, such as walking, balancing, bending, falling, and sitting.

 An important technical contribution within our controller composition framework is an explicit model of pre-conditions.  Unlike previous work focusing on specific athletic movements, our methodology is to begin with a core set of simple actions , including balancing, small steps, falling reactions, recovery from falls, standing up from a chair, and others.
