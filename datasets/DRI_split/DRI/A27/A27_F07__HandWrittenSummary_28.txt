This paper has presented a novel framework for highly adaptive liquid simulation. In their method, a novel, robust discretization works together with accurate embedded boundary conditions and a flexible sizing function to allow for aggressive adaptivity and high computational performance. They have additionally presented a novel surface creation method that yields smooth surfaces in the presence of strongly varying particle radii, which turned out to be an important building block for their framework. These contributions work together to produce a practical fluid simulator that exhibits low computational and memory complexity, fewer visual artifacts, and a high effective simulation resolution. However, mesh generation is still a bottleneck for their simulation. In the future,  they are highly interested in applying their method to other types of phenomena, such as smoke and fire simulations, or visco-elastic materials.
