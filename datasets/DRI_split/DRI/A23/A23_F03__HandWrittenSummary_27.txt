This paper presents a complete production system which enables animators to access the beauty and realism embodied in the physically accurate equations of motion, the Navier-Stokes equations. With this system, animators can express themselves by controlling the simulation dynamics through a familiar user interfaceâ€”the use of images and animations. Texture mapping features allow deferred rendering of flow distortions, with no need to recompute particle trajectories through a time-evolving velocity field. A compressible formulation and two-dimensional simulations allow for quick turnaround time in the creative cycle of creating/modifying simulations and applying the results within the compositor to the final scene. While this production system emphasizes the needs of a traditional animation environment, many of the concepts apply outside this context as well. One of the most useful ideas presented here for three-dimensional simulations is the implementation of an artificial speed of sound through the compressible formulation of the equations. Some of the unique features of the system described in this paper include: a compressible version of the equations of motion; the use of images and animations for controlling the dynamics; fast accurate texture mapping features; and finally, a complete production system. The overall method is globally fourth order accurate in space and time, provided that the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and forcing functions are sufficiently smooth.
