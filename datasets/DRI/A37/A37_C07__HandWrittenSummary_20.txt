Unlike other deformable objects, cloths show some unique characteristics. One of the most significant such features is inextensibility i.e. length of a cloth does not change perceptually despite being twisted or folded. To reproduce this phenomena using mass spring model, designers have to put explicit constraints on stretch parameters. This criteria can generate realistic cloth animation to some extent, but is computationally inefficient. To improve performance, the designer has to compromise accuracy and weaken the constraints, which leads to unrealistic behaviour. The technique proposed in this paper skips the constraint set up by devising an implicit method for simulating the inextensible behaviour. It uses specialized numerical solvers and a fast projection method to speed up the animation process. Using a constrained Langragian mechanics, this method ensures good convergence behaviour as well as enforces inextensibility. The drifting of error through successive frames is blocked by avoiding linearization of constraint equation. It also avoids artifacts in simulation by handling the collision at the very last pass of the process. Though this method is not perfect, it outperforms the traditional mass spring modelling with explicit constraints approach in both computational complexity and visual quality.
