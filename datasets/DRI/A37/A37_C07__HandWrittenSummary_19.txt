One important fact that many popular cloth solvers cannot address without performance degradation is that most fabrics do not stretch under their own weight. The scope of this paper is to introduce a numerical solver that excels at timestepping quasi-inextensible surfaces. Warp and weft, the perpendicular sets of strands that make up a textile, are prohibited from stretching by enforcing constraint equations. Inextensibility gets enforced using Constrained Lagrangian Mechanics (CLM) [Marsden 1999]. We present that constraint-based methods suit better in the quasi-inextensible regime compared to spring-based methods. The proposed method handles both inextensibility and complex collisions by implementing fast projections as a velocity filter. In this way, the method gains speed, simplicity, and software modularity. Experiments show that our method shows asymptotically better performance as permissible strain vanishes and exhibits favourable performance as mesh resolution increases.
