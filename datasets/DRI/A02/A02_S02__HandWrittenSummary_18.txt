We observed that the artifacts of LBS are caused by the straightforward, linear interpolation of vertex positions.

Our basic idea is to change the interpolation domain: we interpolate transformations itself instead of transformed vertex positions.

We justify both theoretically and experimentally that this solution is appropriate for our task (and probably for many others).

Resolving those problems, we obtain a skin animation algorithm that deforms the mesh in much more plausible way then LBS.

Because we change only the interpolation domain and not the input data, our program works with exactly the same models as LBS.
The proposed algorithm improves a deformed shape even of models that have been designed and carefully tuned for LBS.

Considering the high speed and low memory demands of SBS, it provides an attractive alternative to classic LBS.
The overhead of replacing an existing LBS implementation by SBS is minimal, because the input data, as well as the internal data structures, are the same.
 In contrast to other methods, the SBS does not need any additional information, such as the example skins.
