This paper is based on Spherical Blend Skinning: specifically A Real-time Deformation of Articulated Models.  The author is not biased of their work, they are quite critical in some areas: "the system is by no means perfect; it cannot compete with complex, layered models.   However, the SBS algorithm offers reasonable price for elimination of the notorious LBS artifacts.  The time and memory complexity of both algorithms is comparable".
The paper has comparisons to other methods: "In contrast to other methods, the SBS does not need any additional information, such as the example skins".

The aurthor then goes on to talk about the tools the use to gather the data and how: "to perform computations, we use the LAPACK software [Anderson et al. 1999].
We compare the shape of the deformed skin on the model of woman, because the human eye is most sensitive to the deformations of human body.
When it comes to Real time Deformation aspects such as the amount of artists work necessary to design the model."

When using mathematical equation to collate the data "the only displayed element is a skin, a 3D polygonal mesh, usually equipped with normal and texture data.
As a result, the linear blend skinning is still widely used in many applications, in spite of the artifacts."
The paper is summarized by sugguesting which method of skinning is preferable: "there are many methods correcting the problems of LBS, but none of them is superior to LBS in all aspects".
