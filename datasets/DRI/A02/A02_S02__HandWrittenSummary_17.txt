The simplest and most common skinning algorithm is Linear Blend Skinning (LBS).  It is fast but suffers from artefacts when joint rotations are large.  This paper shows that the artefacts in LBS are caused by linear interpolation.  Linear blending is not suitable for capturing the spherical deformations caused by rotating joints on a skeleton.  Instead of trying to correct the bad results of LBS, this work proposes a modifed algorithm called Spherical Blend Skinning (SBS) which replaces the linear interpolation with a quaternion interpolation.  The aim is to develop an algorithm which gives better results than LBS but is not significantly slower.  They address two problems: finding centres of rotation; and interpolating multiple quaternions.  The standard algorithm for interpolating quaternions is Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), but SLERP is incompatible with the proposed mathematical framework.  Instead, this work uses linear interpolation of quaternions (QLERP), derives an upper bound on the error caused by replacing SLERP with QLERP, and shows that the maximum error is negligible.  SBS deforms the skin in a much more plausible way than LBS.  SBS works better than LBS, even on models which have been optimised for LBS.  There is little overhead in replacing LBS with SBS because the data structures are the same, and it can use the same input data.  The speed of SBS is not significantly slower than LBS.  A limitation is that SBS cannot compete with complex layered models.
