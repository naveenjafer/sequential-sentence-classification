This paper presents dynamic morph targets: predefined pose-dependent elastic models that allow an artist to easily author and control the geometry and elastic behavior of dynamic characters.  Dynamic morph targets associate surface and volume deformation with character pose.  The goal of the method is to simulate controllable non-linear deformations by interpolation of dynamic morph targets at run-time.  Dynamic morph targets avoid complex rigging requirements of purely geometric methods, and complex musculoskeletal modeling of purely physically-based methods.  Dynamic characters enhanced with dynamic morph targets can react to external forces just as with other common physically based deformation algorithms, but they also expose non-linear deformations and elastic behavior as imposed by the dynamic morph targets.  The main advantages over previous approaches are three-fold: quality of deformations, dynamic behavior and computational efficiency.  The new approach seeks to bridge the gap between geometric example-based methods and physically-based approaches.  By extending the basic framework to support modal reduction, a high run-time performance is also achieved.
