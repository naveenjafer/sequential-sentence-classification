We introduce a method for extending SSD that enhances its range of modeling capabilities at very little cost, and in a manner optimized for real time graphics hardware.

 We illustrate our method by rendering a very large finite element model (which took several hundred hours to compute) at interactive rates on a PC with negligible cost to the main CPU.

Using commodity graphics hardware, EigenSkin enables the simulation of subtle nonlinear surface deformations of geometrically complex models at little more than the cost of rendering.

 Our results confirm that the EigenSkin method is an effective tool for character skinning when compressed hardware renderable approximations are required for an articulated characterâ€™s nonlinear quasi-static deformations.

EigenSkin works best when SSD corrections are localized, providing independence between different parts of the mesh, and are stable (i.e., corrections vary slowly over posespace), allowing accurate and efficient interpolation.
