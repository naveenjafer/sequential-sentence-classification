The aim of this paper is to introduce a method for extending SSD that enhances its range of modelling capabilities at very little cost, and in a manner optimized for real time graphics hardware.
The author presents a practical technique which overcomes all aforementioned SSD problems, and can be achieved using a memory-efficient linear correction to the traditional SSD method.  It being "extremely popular for its simplicity and plausibility, and is also widely supported by graphics hardware accelerators".

The method is illustrated by "rendering a very large finite element model (which took several hundred hours to compute) at interactive rates on a PC with negligible cost to the main CPU".

Rendering of complex physical deformation models for character animation remains a significant hurdle for interactive applications, but one that has been largely overcome for off-line animation.

Currently, most real time character animation, e.g., for video games, is done using a very common linear transform blending technique called (among other things) Skeletal-Subspace Deformation (SSD) [Magnenat-Thalmann et al. 1988].

The method proposed "allows subtle character deformations for skin and clothing, such as those derived from highly realistic artist-drawn poses, measurements from the real world, or laboriously computed anatomically and physically-based models".

Instead of storing displacement fields for each key pose and then interpolating between them at runtime, as in Pose Space Deformation (PSD) [Lewis et al. 2000], the author uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct an error-optimal eigendisplacement basis for representing this potentially large set of pose corrections.
