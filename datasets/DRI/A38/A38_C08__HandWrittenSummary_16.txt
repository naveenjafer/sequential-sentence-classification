Several recent major movie releases have demonstrated that the motion of clothing adds greatly to the appearance of a virtual character. The virtual clothing must eligible to move and be rendered so that it blends in seamlessly with the motion and appearance of the real clothing in the scene. In this paper, is presented an algorithm for estimating the parameters of a cloth simulation from video data of real fabric. The mentioned parameters are optimized on a set of static shots and motion clips of a small swatch of a particular fabric and then tested on a simulation of a full skirt made from that fabric. Itâ€™s being used a simulated annealing for the optimization step with an optimization function that assesses the extent to which the folds in the simulated and physical fabric match.
Because the presented in this paper framework for estimating cloth simulation parameters is independent of the cloth model, it can, in principle, select a specific model that meets a set of criteria such as accuracy or simulation speed.
The results show that the parameters obtained from this optimization approach approximately capture the static shape and dynamic properties of skirts of different materials.
