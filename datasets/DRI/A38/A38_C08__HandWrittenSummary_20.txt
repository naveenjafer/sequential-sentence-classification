Cloth simulation plays an important role in realistic animation. Unfortunately, this task is not trivial due to its unique characteristics. Cloths show high flexibility while sheering and bending, but are almost rigid against stretching. Another limiting aspect is the great complexity of the task of detecting collisions. For these phenomena, to achieve a reasonably accurate animation is computationally inefficient and takes huge of time. This makes real time simulation of cloths even more challenging. Some automated systems have been developed which, once calibrated correctly, can produce realistic cloth animation. But this approach is not suitable because of varying nature of different types of cloths. The system must be calibrated separately for each type of cloth. The quality of animation greatly depends on the choice of other simulation parameters, which the designer has to choose manually. In this paper, the authors tried to automate the calibration process by using reference videos of real cloth. At first, a small swatch is captured and simulated during some predefined motion. Simulation parameters are adapted from the difference between poses of real cloth and simulated cloth. Then these parameters are used to simulate some dresses made with same type of cloth as the swatch. They have used various types of dresses made of different types of cloths, moved along some predefined motion for their simulations. Although the poses and implicit complexity of a small swatch is much limited than the full dress, the experiments have showed promising results.
