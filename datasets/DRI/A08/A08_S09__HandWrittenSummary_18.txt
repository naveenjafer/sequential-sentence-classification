Our solution, termed pose space deformation, provides a uniform and expressive approach to both facial skin deformation and skeleton-driven deformation.
 It addresses the previously drawbacks of shape interpolation and SSD while retaining the simplicity and performance associated with these techniques.
The algorithm introduced in this paper removes the need for layered fix-it approaches and permits direct specification of the desired deformations.
the algorithm has clear advantages with respect to simplicity and generality, direct manipulation, real-time synthesis, and other criteria listed in the introduction.
The crux of the approach is the identification of an appropriate space for defining deformations.
PSD unifies and improves upon two techniques that have been common graphics practice for more than a decade.
 This relatively simple algorithm uniformly handles a variety of deformation situations ranging from a simple elbow to secondary animation.
The setup cost of the algorithm is insignificant, and the synthesis cost is only slightly more than that of shape interpolation, so real-time synthesis is possible at effective resolutions on current hardware.
