Pose space deformation (PSD) is a new skinning technique which addresses the drawbacks of shape interpolation and SSD while retaining the simplicity and performance associated with these techniques.  PSD unfies and improves on these two established techniques.  The crux of the approach is the identification of an appropriate space for defining deformations.  The goal is to directly sculpt the desired deformation at various points in the parameter space, rather than working in a more abstract space such as the coefficients on various coordinate frames as required by the SSD algorithm.  The deformations are represented as mappings from a pose space to coordinate displacements.  The interpolation method chosen was  the Gaussian radial basis.  To make the job easier for the interpolation, the interpolation is based on the desired deviation of a surface vertex from its initially computed position.  PSD provides a uniform and expressive approach to both facial skin deformation and skeleton-driven deformation.  The scheme can be bootstrapped on top of an existing software system: the model is posed as desired and the desired surface at that pose is sculpted.  The setup cost of the algorithm is insignificant, and the synthesis cost is only slightly more than that of shape interpolation, so real-time synthesis is possible at effective resolutions on current hardware.
