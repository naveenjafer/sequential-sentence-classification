We employ a representation of fluid velocity and vorticity in a finite dimensional basis of Laplacian eigenfunctions. Our method supports the interaction of immersed moving obstacles and buoyancy through projection of forces to the velocity basis fields.

The orthogonality of the basis functions and their correspondence to a spectrum of vorticity scales enables energy control at varying turbulent scales. We have used this property to enforce stability of integrators and simulate physical viscosity. Flexibility in choosing basis dimensionality and the ability to integrate directly in a space of basis coefficients permits computational efficiency, enabling interactive performance. The performance of our method is independent of the domain or grid resolution. Our method allows controllable viscosity, and supports general domains through a formulation on discrete meshes. Our method satisfies incompressibility automatically as it operates directly in a space of divergence free fields. Our method is most applicable to gaseous phenomena and situations when the domain is entirely filled by fluid.

Currently it is not readily adaptable to typical liquid simulations that require a constantly changing fluid domain with a free surface. Various issues prevent it from scaling well to very large basis dimension or grid resolutions. For irregular domains, the runtime is in general O(N 3 ). For domains with closed form expressions the shape of the boundary is limited. Also, when advecting many particles or projecting many forces the velocity basis fields must still be cached as the cost of closed form evaluations become prohibitive.
