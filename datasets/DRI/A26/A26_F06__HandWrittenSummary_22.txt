This paper presents an algorithm for the simulation of incompressible fluid phenomena that is computationally efficient and leads to visually convincing simulations with far fewer degrees of freedom than existing approaches. Rather than using an Eulerian grid or Lagrangian elements, they employ a representation of fluid velocity and vorticity in a finite dimensional basis of Laplacian eigenfunctions.  The Laplacian eigenfunctions are defined by their domain and boundary conditions, making the velocity and vorticity basis fields domain dependent.  The choosing Laplacian eigenfunctions for this basis provides benefits, including correspondence with spatial scales of vorticity and precise energy control at each scale. Energy control at varying turbulent scales enforces stability of integrators and simulates physical viscosity. Flexibility in choosing basis dimensionality and the ability to integrate directly in a space of basis coefficients permits computational efficiency, enabling interactive performance.
This algorithm can be formulated as Galerkin projection of the vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations onto Laplacian eigenfunctions defined over the simulation domain. It admits closed form solutions on simple domains but can also be implemented efficiently on arbitrary meshes. They have described many of its unique properties and its use as a practical means of fluid simulation. Their method also supports the interaction of immersed moving obstacles and buoyancy through projection of forces to the velocity basis fields.  There are many exciting avenues remain to be explored, such as spectral energy control, space time optimization and other research area such as medical imaging and inverse flow modelling.
