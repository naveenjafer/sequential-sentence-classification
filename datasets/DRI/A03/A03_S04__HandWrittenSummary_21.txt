The aim of this paper  is describe a way to make animating simple for "novices and children".  In a conventional skeletal animation package, the user must rig the character manually, this paper suggests the authors method is easier to comprehend, creating animation that would take a large amount of time and detail, at the click of a button.  

This paper states: "Combined with a system for motion synthesis [Arikan et al. 2003], this would allow users to begin interacting with their creations."

"We have several ideas for improving Pinocchio that we have not yet tried".The author mentions their own system, which is used to aid the skinning process.

Pre-animation this paper makes a point of saying: " The character must be given in approximately the same orientation and pose as the skeleton...as well having the same proportions".

We also believe that some of our techniques, such as finding LBS weights and using examples to learn the weights of a linear combination of penalty functions, can be useful in other contexts.

In the testing stage of the paper results showed the algorithm "computed a good rig for all but 3 of these characters".  This was an essential outcome which promotes why their method could be useable.
