Our algorithm consists of two main steps: skeleton embedding and skin attachment.
Skeleton embedding computes the joint positions of the skeleton inside the character by minimizing a penalty function.

 To make the optimization problem computationally feasible, we first embed the skeleton into a discretization of the character’s interior and then refine this embedding using continuous optimization.

The skin attachment is computed by assigning bone weights based on the proximity of the embedded bones smoothed by a diffusion equilibrium equation over the character’s surface.

Our design decisions relied on three criteria, which we also used to evaluate our system.

 For this, we designed a maximum-margin supervised learning method to combine a set of hand-constructed penalty functions.

We evaluate Pinocchio with respect to the three criteria stated in the introduction: generality, quality, and performance.

We have presented the first method for automatically rigging an unfamiliar character for skeletal animation. We have shown that using this method, Pinocchio can animate a wide range of characters.
