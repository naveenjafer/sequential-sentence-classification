Animating a mesh model of a character requires "rigging", in which a skeleton is added to the model and coupled to the mesh.  Manual rigging is tedious and requires skill.  This paper proposes a system called Pinocchio which embeds a generic skeleton into a mesh model and attaches the mesh to the skeleton.  Pinocchio is user-friendly and can be used by novices.  The algorithm consists of two parts: skeleton embedding and skin attachment.  The embedding algorithm starts with a model and a skeleton.  The model volume must be connected, the skeleton must be in the same orientation and pose as the model, and the model must be proportioned like the skeleton.  Pinocchio positions the skeleton in the model by optimizing a cost function consisting of 9 basis penalty functions. The weights of the basis functions are learned  from a training set.  The skinning algorithm is the well-known LBS; the attachment weights are calculated using a heat diffusion algorithm.  Pinocchio was tested on 16 models.  The skeleton was correctly embedded in 13 of these models.  For the remaining 3, a hint for a single joint was sufficient to produce a good embedding.  The penalty function which was learned from the training set generalized well to both new characters and new skeletons.  Characters with extremely thin limbs often fail because the the graph becomes disconnected.  Degree 2 joints such as knees and elbows are often positioned incorrectly within a limb.  Pinocchio does not distinguish materials, so dresses and armour look rubbery.
