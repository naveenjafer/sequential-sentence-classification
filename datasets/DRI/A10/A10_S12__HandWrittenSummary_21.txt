Skinning is an important part of realistic articulated body animation and is an important topic of computer graphics and animation.

This paper begins by discussing how important the topic (Skinning) is: "Skinning is an important part of realistic articulated body animation and is an important topic of computer graphics and animation".  
The author then goes on to say what will be mentioned in the paper: "In this paper, we present a parallel skinning algorithm suitable for SIMD architectures such as GPUs

There is some criticism mentioned: " Although widely used, simple algorithmic skinning schemes cannot capture the complexity and subtlety of real skin deformation, and revised approaches will be required to increase character animation realism."

A specific type of skinning is spoken about "Physically-based skinning is based on the biomechanics of skin deformation arising from the motions of muscles and tendons".  As compared to what the author has developed themselves: "We developed parallel skinning using the GPU fragment processors and demonstrate our method using three rendering passes".

Another method of skinning mentioned: "Weighted pose space deformation (WPSD) is an example based skinning method that generates high quality skinning with a limited number of sample poses".  Also its disadvantages: "it can generate an accurate skinning, it requires more computation than the original pose space deformation (PSD) [LCF00], since joint distances are computed independently for each vertex."

Finally the paper is summarized, the testing process is discussed We tested our methods using upper arm models consisting of four joints (collar, shoulder, elbow, and wrist).
