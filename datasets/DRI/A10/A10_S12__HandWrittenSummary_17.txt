This paper presents a parallel skinning algorithm for implementation on the GPU.  It is based on Weighted Pose Space Deformation (WPSD).  They develop a parallel WPSD method using the fragment processors to gain greater parallelism and performance.  The algorithm includes automatic calculation of the joint weights per vertex, using non-negative least squares (NNLS).  Although the fragment program cannot directly access the vertex data, the efficiency of parallel computation on a fragment program is higher, since the fragment processor has more processing units and each of them has more computation power than a vertex processor.  Therefore WPSD can clearly benefit from parallel computation on fragment processors.  The algorithm consists of three passes: two through the fragment shader and one through the vertex shader.  The methods were tested on upper arm models consisting of four joints (collar, shoulder, elbow, and wrist).  The GPU-based deformation is about 20 times faster than CPU-based deformation. Real-time applications using SSD can substitute WPSD running on the GPU without loosing their real-time performance.
