Realistic cloth simulation is a hard to achieve milestone due to its unique deformable nature. Cloths are somewhat stiff to stretching forces but allows large deformation regarding bending and sheering forces. This behaviour also makes collision detection much complex than regular 3d objects. To accurately reproduce these behaviours, several models have been proposed. Physical based particle system can generate accurate results but computationally inefficient. Mass spring model is popular among the designers but is subject to the choice of various parameters. Triangular or rectangular mesh can be used to render folds and wrinkles, but requires solving large linear systems and partial differential equations. These can be solved explicitly at the cost of poor running time. Performance can be improved by relaxing constraints which leads to unrealistic behaviour. Another limiting aspect of such approaches is the time steps. To skip some frames and render one at a later time, the system must calculate the intermediate states to restrict propagation of errors. The authors in this paper proposed a novel implicit method for solving such linear systems which creates visually pleasing animation. They also applied some improvements to other parts of the pipeline which results in outstandingly fast computation. Efficient management of forces and intelligent detection of collision gives realistic animation at very fast rate. Large time steps are inherent to this system which allows fast animation. At the same time, adaptive modification of step size ensures realistic behaviour in abrupt scenarios.
