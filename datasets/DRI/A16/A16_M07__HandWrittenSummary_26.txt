Despite great advances in recent years, creating effective tools for synthesis of realistic human motion remains an open problem in computer animation.

We adapt a single motion sequence several times to synthesize a family of motions that preserve physics constraints. Motions created in this manner can satisfy an animatorâ€™s exact specifications with a minimum of deviation from the initial motion sequence. Ideally, we would like to use a minimal source of motion data, perhaps a single captured movement, to create a wide range of additional motions. Our system is based on an optimization algorithm that can transform the captured motion to satisfy high-level user constraints while preserving physical realism.

The primary contribution of this work is a new momentum-based method for adaptation of ballistic character movement. In contrast to previous dynamic-based adaptation methods, our framework can produce an wide range of motions that are significantly different from the original motion. Our method does not require model reduction, or a reduced motion space. Because we do not solve for the generalized forces for each joint angle, our method is also significantly faster than other physics-based transformation methods. We also show how the same framework can be adapted for inverse control.  

Naturally, our framework does not handle all realistic character motions. It specifically applies to highly-dynamic motions with ballistic stages. We suspect that momentumbased approach would not be well suited for less energetic motions such as walking.
