In this paper, we present an automated method to build character skins that are fast to compute and compactly represented from a set of examples.
This technique allows artists to use any skin authoring tools they like while producing characters that meet the performance demands and work with the computation models used in interactive systems.
We present a framework for extending linear blend skinning that allows us to capture these detailed skin deformations.
The key to our success is that since vertices choose weighted sums of transformations, if any linear scaling of an added joint is beneficial it may be used.
 We emphasize that this is a framework for obtaining better deformations and the joints we choose to add are based on our observations of characters.

While our technique works well for a wide variety of character skins, it has limitations.
Despite these limitations, our method produces high-quality yet fast and compact skinned characters that work with existing game engines, graphics hardware and other runtime systems.
