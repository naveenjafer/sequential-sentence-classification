This paper presented a method for example-based performance control of human motion. Given a set of synchronized control and target motions, the method applies an analogous mapping to a new input control motion.To learn indirect mappings, this paper adopts a memory-based approach which implicitly encodes the desired mapping using a database of semantically meaningful example instances. The dynamic programming algorithm uses segments of motion along with an objective function that accounts for both the quality of control interpretation and the continuity of the target motion to generate visually and semantically correct motions. An important benefit of this design choice is the ability to use segments, rather than frames, as the primitive unit of motion. An important benefit of this design choice is the ability to use segments, rather than frames, as the primitive unit of motion. The first example of controlling walk motion from mouse trajectories demonstrates its ability to map low-dimensional input to high-dimensional motion. The second example of  controlling a dance follower with the motion of a dance leader demonstrates the methodâ€™s capability to handle complex, stylized mappings.The segment similarity metric is proved to be effective for the experiments carried out in this work. However, other metrics may be more appropriate for different types of motion and believe that it is a promising direction for future research.
