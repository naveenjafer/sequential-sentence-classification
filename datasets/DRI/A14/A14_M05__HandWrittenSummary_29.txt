Dynamic programming was used  to select a sequence that balances the quality of interpretation with the continuity of the induced target motion.Proposed method requires no presegmentation; moreover, it produces a semantically guided segmentation as part of the optimization. In this context, our work might be viewed as a competency module that enhances the skills of characters to enable their participation in complex interactive performances. A method for example-based performance control of human motion was presented. Dynamic programming algorithm uses segments of motion along with an objective function that accounts for both the quality of control interpretation and the continuity of the target motion to generate visually and semantically correct motions. The algorithm generated semantically correct partner motion even from test sequences of leader motions that did not appear in the training set. Dynamic programming algorithm performs a global optimization, which precludes the local decisions that are required for online applications.To preserve spatial dependencies in mappings, we apply rigid transformations to optimally align control segments with input control motions.However,  other metrics may be more appropriate for different types of motion and believe that it is a promising direction for future research, also it can compute results significantly faster than input motion can be recorded, thus making it suitable for rapid-feedback motion authoring applications.
