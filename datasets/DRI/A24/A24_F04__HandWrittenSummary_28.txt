In this paper, we explore four forms of advection encountered in fluid simulation: velocity, smoke density, image and level set advections. We show that the implementation complexity of these schemes may be easily avoided by adding a very simple Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction (BFECC) to an existing first order semiLagrangian schemes, thus improving its space and time accuracy to second order. We show that this approach reduces velocity damping and smoke density dilution and demonstrate its benefits on the four forms of advections discussed previously. We, however, use BFECC and the simple redistancing for level set advection of various fluid simulations and show that sufficiently realistic fluid animation can be obtained.We conclude that BFECC creates a physically correct fluctuations in a coarser grid.

BFECC has implementation simplicity and efficiency. BFECC provided very small dissipation/diffusion. BFECC is linearly stable. Reducing velocity dissipation could be important in simulating fluid and rigid body interaction. Once the simple first order upwinding or semi-Lagrangian steps for velocity, smoke density, image or level set advections are implemented, BFECC can be added with a trivial amount of code. We show that this simple extension yields significant enhancements in reducing diffusion and dissipation in velocity, smoke, image advection and in preserving volume under various situations including two-phase flows and rigid bodies.
