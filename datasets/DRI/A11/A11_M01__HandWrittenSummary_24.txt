This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for composing specialist controllers into more general and capable control systems for dynamic characters. Individual controllers are black boxes encapsulating control knowledge that is possibly gleaned from the biomechanics literature, derived from the robotics control literature, or developed specifically for animation control. As a testbed of our techniques, we are developing a physicallysimulated animated character capable of a large repertoire of motor skills. A controller within the pool of available controllers can be as simple as a constant force, or as complex as a structured hierarchy of multiple levels of control abstraction. The open challenge here lies in developing appropriate control strategies for specific actions and ways of integrating them into a coherent whole. The successful composition of controllers based on manually determined pre-conditions is demonstrated. Pre-conditions can be determined automatically by a machine learning approach (Support Vector Machines (SVM)). Once trained offline which normally takes hours, the SVM classifier can provide answers on-line in milliseconds. This system is, to date, the first to demonstrate a dynamic anthoropomorphic character with controlled reactions to disturbances or falls in any direction, as well as the ability to pick itself up off the ground in several ways, among other controlled motions. Limitations of this framework is mainly concerned with the adaptations to variable terrain, dynamic environments, character dimensions and mass. Other methods of “teaching” skills to a dynamic character also warrant investigation.
