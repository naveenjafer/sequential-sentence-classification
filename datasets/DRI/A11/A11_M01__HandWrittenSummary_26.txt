In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for composing specialist controllers into more general and capable control systems for dynamic characters.In our framework, individual controllers are black boxes encapsulating control knowledge that is possibly gleaned from the biomechanics literature, derived from the robotics control literature, or developed specifically for animation control.An important technical contribution within our controller composition framework is an explicit model of pre-conditions. We introduce an automatic, machine learning approach to determining pre-conditions, which is based on systematically sampling the performance of controllers. We demonstrate families of composable controllers for articulated skeletons whose physical parameters reflect anthropometric data consistent with a fully-fleshed adult male.

To our knowledge, our system is the first to demonstrate a dynamic anthoropomorphic character with controlled reactions to disturbances or falls in any direction, as well as the ability to pick itself up off the ground in several ways, among other controlled motions.
In general, the 2D model simulates in real time, while the 3D model runs between 5 and 9 times slower than real time on a 733 MHz Pentium III system.Controllers that can perform a sensible action given the current state of the character return an integer in the range, while those that can handle the current state as well as guarantee a transition to the desired state, return an integer in the range .Published control methods for 3D walking, running, and stair climbing make obvious candidates for integration into our system.
