While the simulation of wind is an area of vast interest in aerodynamic engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and animation/visualisation of fluids in computer graphics, it has been a rather abandoned subject in simulation of deformable objects such as cloth simulation. This is mostly due to the fact that conventional CFD applications require enormous computational power. In this paper, the authors compare the modelsâ€™ advantages and disadvantages and show practical results of the described methods. Two different approaches have being investigated to model force fields describing air motion and show how these models can be augmented to exhibit interaction with deformable thin objects such as textiles. The first model is based on the Navier-Stokes equations, while the second method extends simple particle tracing methods by the effect of lee. The first concentrates on physically accurate computations using a semi-Lagrangian approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the second model incorporates a particle tracing method for global wind fields. Both methods produce realistic looking results which are capable of enhancing the realism of computer animations.
