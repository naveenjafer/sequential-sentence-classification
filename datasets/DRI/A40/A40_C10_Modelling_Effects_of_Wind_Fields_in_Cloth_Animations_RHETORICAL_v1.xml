        <H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
      
      <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">While the simulation of wind is an area of vast interest in aerodynamic engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and animation/visualisation of fluids in computer graphics, it has been a rather abandoned subject in simulation of deformable objects such as cloth simulation.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">This is mostly due to the fact that conventional CFD applications require enormous computational power.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">However, aerodynamic effects are obviously capable of enhancing the realism of an animated scene and thus are an important part of a cloth simulation system.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge">For example, air resistance is a vital component which cannot be neglected if realistic animation is desired [ BTH + 03 ].</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Challenge_Goal">In this work we discuss two different approaches to

with the fluid present in it, i.e. in our case clothes with the wind.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">On the one hand the wind deforms the objects which on the other hand change the wind flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">To describe the above situation by a physical model we require the Neumann boundary condition ∂u =0 ∂n to be satisfied for the wind flow u at any boundary point of an object with normal n.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Rigid objects like walls will influence the fluid field but will not be affected by fluid forces themselves.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Deformable objects like cloth are supposed to both experience fluid forces and itself influence the fluid flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This in fact is a major difficulty.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Consider a point p b on the boundary of a deformable object in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Let u(p b ) be the corresponding wind velocity at that point and n be its normal.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">On the one hand, we want the Neumann boundary condition u(p b ) · n = 0 to be satisfied.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">On the other hand, the wind velocity orthogonal to the object’s surface is just what causes the aerodynamic forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Without further remedial action setting the boundary according to the Neumann condition would mean that the fluid will not exert forces on the objects.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Here we propose a method which meets both requirements.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">For every deformable object the velocity value of the surrounding wind field for every vertex of the representing mesh is tracked.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">In the solver’s cycle, the boundary conditions are then set prior to any other operation: For every object in the scene each triangle of its representing mesh is registered in the fluid grid, which means that the cell of the wind field occupied by the object is marked as occupied.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The wind velocity at the vertex positions of the object is recorded.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Additionally, the normals of these vertices are stored.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Then, the aerodynamic forces as described in section 3 are calculated.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Finally, for every marked cell in the scene the previously stored normals are averaged in one space cell which are used to update the velocity at the cell to satisfy the Neumann boundary condition.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Thus, the boundary conditions are met and yet aerodynamic forces are obtained.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A different issue is how to deal with the inside of (rigid) objects.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The method to set boundary conditions as described above does not account for the interior of objects.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Thus, a nonzero velocity could be mistakenly assigned to cells lying inside an object.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">To avoid this situation, the path of the wind flow is checked for object intersection, whereby the collision detection of the cloth simulation system provides a simple method to deal with this issue <CitSpan>[MKE03]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">4.2 Particle Tracing on Wind Fields Here we combine the idea of creating wind fields by predefined flow primitives with particle tracing in given flow fields.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">To define a wind scene we first built up the air flow by simple primitives such as parallel directed wind fields, vortices, etc.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We then use a par- ticle tracing method in the defined wind field to determine the effect of lee by detecting windless areas.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This method is very easy to implement and yields very plausible and nicely looking results.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A simple approach to generate complex air flows is to define a wind field by mathematical functions which assign to each point in space a unique velocity value.</Sentence> As Wejchert et al. <CitSpan>[WH91]</CitSpan> have shown, this already enables an animator to design even complex wind fields: Assuming an irrotational (∇ × u = 0), inviscid, and incompressible (∇ · u = 0) fluid, the NavierStokes equations which describe the mechanics of any fluid (see section 4.1) can be simplified to give the

inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Some primitives common to fluid simulations are depicted in figure 2 .</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">One drawback of this model is that it cannot handle objects exhibiting complex boundaries.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The approach to model solid objects in the scene taken by Wejchert et al. consists in placing a wind source using a mirror principle in order to extinguish the air flow at the boundary of the object.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">While this works for simple objects this approach is not feasible at all with deformable objects like textiles.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Another more serious drawback of this model for our application consists in the lack of interaction with objects.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The wind flow defined by the primitives will not react on objects in the scene which means for example that tissues in the lee of other objects will be affected by the wind flow as well.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">However, this method can be combined with the aerodynamic model described in section 3 to give nice and fast results as will be shown in section 5.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">To solve the described problems we propose a model which combines the simple global wind flow techniques with a particle tracing method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Here, particles are moved along the wind field to determine the effect of objects in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This model divides the scene into parallelepiped cells.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">There are two common approaches to discretising the continuous velocity field defined in space: one can either choose the midpoint of a cell <CitSpan>[Sta99]</CitSpan> or its six faces <CitSpan>[FM96]</CitSpan> to define the field.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">As usual, values between the defining points of the grid are interpolated using trilinear functions.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The basic idea of the particle tracing method is to trace wind particles through a field w = i w i defined by linear superposition of wind sources corresponding to flow primitives with respective velocity fields w i .</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The field w does not account for lee effects caused by objects in the flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Therefore we compute the wind field u containing these effects as follows.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">In our model every wind source is also a particle source: These particles form an uncoupled particle system which can be considered as a wind gust.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The wind particles are emitted into the velocity field w i of the corresponding wind source which is defined on a grid.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The specific emission intervals and amounts depend on the properties of the flow sources.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In every time step each particle in a wind gust moves along its velocity field w i defined by the corresponding wind source.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Notice that the movement of the particles in a wind gust is only affected by the wind source they belong to.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The global superposition of all wind sources has no effect on these particles.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">To calculate the wind particles’ positions we used the explicit Euler integration scheme.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">For a wind particle at position p t and time t this results in a path s(p t , p t+∆t ), where p t+∆t denotes the position after time step ∆t according to p t+∆t = p t + w i (p t , ∆t) .</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">As a particle moves along its path in space, all grid cells colliding with the path are updated with the velocity of the associated wind source with respect to the position of the particle.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The particle might cross several grid cells on its way during a single time step.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">If this is the case, the path of the particle has to be subdivided into parts not exceeding the size of a grid cell.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This path is then tested for collisions with the objects in the scene.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The velocity field u is then computed as for each grid cell separately, where w i are all those wind sources whose particles have reached the cell.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">If a collision is detected at position p col the normal of the colliding object n obj (p col ) is determined and the velocity of the particle is set to w i (p col , t+∆t) = w i (p col , t)−(n obj ·w i (p col , t))·n obj This assures that the velocity component of the resulting field u is orthogonal to the collision object’s surface at p col is zero, i.e. u(p col , t + ∆t) · n obj = 0 , and thus no flow propagates through the object.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The wind force effective on objects in the scene is then computed from the velocity field u.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Since u is determined using the wind particles, every point p that could not be reached by any wind particle will hold zero velocity even if w may hold a nonzero velocity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Thus,

        <H1>CONCLUSIONS</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome_Contribution">We presented two models for including advanced wind effects into cloth simulation systems.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The first concentrates on physically accurate computations using a semi-Lagrangian approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the second model incorporates a particle tracing method for global wind fields.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">As illustrated in the previous section both methods produce realistic looking results which are capable of enhancing the realism of computer animations.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">While the first model has a wider range of applications, the second one provides an easy method which still delivers realistic effects such as air resistance and lee.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">All methods described in this work should be easy to extend to three-dimensional deformable objects.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">All the methods apply the same except for simple changes.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Since three-dimensional objects define an inner and outer part, the adaption of the face normals in equation (3.1) is not necessary.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Moreover, in the wind field computation care has to be taken that no wind field is present in the object.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Here, the same method as described for rigid objects (section 4.2.2) can be applied.</Sentence>
