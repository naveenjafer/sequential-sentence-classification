Many cloth simulators have been developed to produce realistic virtual cloth motion and produce realistic results given the appropriate parameter choosing. The scope of this paper is to automatically determine these parameters from a sequence of video frames. Parameter estimation is independent of the cloth model. For the current analysis, the model described by Baraff and Witkin has been selected due to its performance in terms of accuracy and simulation speed. The parameters are optimised on a set of static shots and motion clips of a small swatch, based on tests which span the range of behaviours expected to be seen in the final sequences of motion, from soft and flowing (satin) to still (linen), of the full skirt. The process optimisation is based on simulated annealing and assessment of the error between the folds of the physical and simulated fabric. Folds and surface orientation are detected through a video captured under a stripped light.  Experiments are performed to capture at least six parameters (stiffness and damping parameters for stretch, shear, and bend) for each fabric to be used as a calibration setup of a cloth simulator. The results of testing are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the optimisation approach to capture the static shape and the dynamic properties of skirts of different materials.
