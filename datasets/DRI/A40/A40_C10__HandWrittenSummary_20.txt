Accurate aerodynamic effects are vital for enhancing realism in animation and thus became an important element in cloth simulation research. Modeling fluid flows is a matured topic and has come near perfection. But the effect of wind flow on deformable thin object like cloths/textiles is often neglected due to massive computational load incurred in the process. This requires special attention because, not only the object changes its shape, but also the flow itself is changed. In this paper, the authors proposes two novel approaches to address this issue which also overcome some other limitations, as well as produce realistic animation. The first method is based on well known Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow modeling. This equation is simplified to reduce computational complexity at the expense of some preciseness. The second approach is straight forward particle tracing, where a global wind flow model is assumed. This method also trades some accuracy for easier implementation. Finally, these two implementations are used to simulate some test scenes containing both deformable and rigid objects. Rigid object is used to control wind flow over different cloth object or different part of same cloth object. Both the systems successfully simulated wind effect on clothes as well as "Lee effect" (absence of wind flow) on deformable thin object and produced realisitic animations. The work can be easily extended for modelling three dimensional deformable objects.
