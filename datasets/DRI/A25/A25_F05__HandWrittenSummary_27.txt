This paper e propose a method to simulate fluids with such rapidly changing domains by generating a new tetrahedral simulation mesh at each time step. This paper uses the position and shape of boundaries as well as criteria based on the visually important parts of the fluid and velocity field to construct a sizing field that dictates the desired edge length for tetrahedra throughout the domain. They use an efficient and reliable meshing algorithm to produce a mesh that is refined according to this field. They transfer the physical properties of the simulation from the old mesh to the new mesh using a generalization of the semi-Lagrangian velocity advection technique that introduces no additional smoothing. They perform a mass conservation step that has been extended to allow a new, single-step solution of two-way coupling between fluid and rigid bodies.Overall, the method provides a flexible environment for creating complex scenes involving fluid animation.
