This paper have presented a system for performing fluid animation using unstructured tetrahedral domains that can change arbitrarily at each time step. This method provides a flexible framework for fluid simulation that opens the door to many features. They transferred the physical properties of the simulation from the old mesh to the new mesh using a generalization of the semi-Lagrangian velocity advection technique that introduces no additional smoothing. Meanwhile, they performed a mass conservation step that has been extended to allow anew, single-step solution of two-way coupling between fluid and rigid bodies. The main contribution of this method is to demonstrate the freedom granted by remeshing at each simulation time step.
