To produce realistic animation, the designer has to add a lot of small details to 3D models, which leads to complex geometry of these models. An alternate approach is to reconstruct the models in 3D form actual real world pictures.  The reconstruction is done by recognizing these patterns and establishing neighbourhood among them. This approach is efficient for simple geometric structure and flat surface. But the quality of the animation degrades sharply with occlusion and movement of the structure . This is specially noticeable in animating clothes, where occlusion is natural due to wrinkles and motion of the body parts. In this paper, the authors addressed this issue by proposing some novel improvements over existing algorithm. The improved algorithm uses small but distinguishable patterns of solid colors from full colour-space. Instead of neighbourhood analysis, they emphasized on strain constraint to reconstruct the 3D structure of the object. Finally, they applied a novel data driven hole filling algorithm to fill up the occluded regions of the object. During animation, successive frames are processed by a modified temporal smoothing algorithm. Most interesting attribute of this algorithm is, complex motion of clothes due to interaction with the body is also modeled without the presence of a high quality 3D human model. Although the acquisition process requires complex camera setup and precise lighting requirements, the set can be reused for successive captures. Relatively fast computation and high quality realistic animation makes this method a perfect choice for professional studio production.
