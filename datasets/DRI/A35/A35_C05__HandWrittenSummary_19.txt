One of the most important aspects in the design and efficiency of a cloth simulation system is the proper choice of the simulation method and its implementation, among a vast range of available methods in literature. The paper focus on particle system methods which best fit on highly deformable objects like cloths. The evolution of the system has to be integrated numerically. The scope of the paper is to present the parameters which determine the choice of the appropriate integration method per simulation and provide a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the main integration methods in terms of total computation time, accuracy and numerical stability. The analysis mainly focuses on the explicit Midpoint, the explicit Runge-Kutta method and the Backward Euler methods due to their implementation simplicity and efficiency in particle systems
