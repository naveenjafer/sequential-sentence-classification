Numerical methods for integrating equation that represents mechanical behaviour of cloth is crucial in cloth simulation. There are numerous simulation methods including finite elements, continnum mechanics and particle systems. Correct choice of simulation method and implementing it accurately is of great importance for efficiency in simulation. In order to make the right decision, comparative performance of the various numerical integration methods needs to be thoroughly analysed against some key performance indicators such as the computation time (number of iteration), time step size, and numerical stability. In this work, the authors have evaluated and compared the performance of several well known numerical methods such as Midpoint, Runge-Kutta, Euler Backward and forward methods in various simulation contexts. From the results and discussion it is clear that no one method outperforms other in all the scenarios against all the performance indicators. For example, Backward Euler method performs best when computation time is taken into account whereas the Runge-Kutta performs worst taking nearly 6 times higher duration. However, when accuracy is considered for a uniform discretised mesh, midpoint and Runge-Kutta are both able to preserve the accuracy more correctly within their range of numerical stability compared to inverse Euler's technique.  Similarly, when draping speed is considered backward Eulers performs the best. In real case simulation garment assembly and animation stages are involved with different important aspects. The accuracy of the dealing with damping can be further improved by incorporating effect of viscosity, hysteretic behaviour, collision damping and friction.
