In this paper, we present a new technique to model interactions between particle based fluids and mesh based deformable solids which meets the constraints that is computationally efficient and the generated interaction forces don't induce any instabilities to the dynamic simulation. We present our interaction model with fluids represented by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach (SPH) and with deformable solids represented by a Finite Element approach. The key contribution of our paper is to place these ghost particles onto boundary triangles of deformable objects and to derive their locations and weights according to Gauss integration, which allows to model fluid-solid interactions stably at interactive rates. We propose a Lennard-Jones-like force that models both repulsion and adhesion to the contact surface.

The general interaction model we propose works with any type of deformation technique as long as the object surface is represented by a polygonal mesh and the fluid by Lagrangian particles. An important application of our method is the simulation of bleeding during virtual operations.

There is a trade-off between computation time for the neighbor search and the quality of the neighbor list. On todayâ€™s hardware only a limited number of fluid particles can be simulated in real-time which yields a relatively coarse fluid surface. A difficulty in connection with the interactive simulation of fluids is the extraction and rendering of a plausible fluid surface in real time. Thus, ongoing work focuses on fast algorithms for surface reconstruction.
