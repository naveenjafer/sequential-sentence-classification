This paper introduces an Eulerian liquid simulation framework based on the Voronoi diagram of a potentially unorganized collection of pressure samples. With careful placement of pressure samples, the Voronoi mesh-based fluid solver makes it possible for explicit surface tracking to achieve its full potential in capturing the complete liquid surface geometry, including very small scale liquid features. They exploit this by choosing samples that accurately capture the geometry and topology of the liquid surface. When combined with high resolution explicit surface tracking this allows simulating nearly arbitrarily thin features, while eliminating noise and other artifacts that arise when there is a resolution mismatch between the simulation and the surfaceâ€”and allowing a precise inclusion of surface tension based directly on and at the same resolution as the surface mesh. In addition, they adapted embedded boundary pressure projection techniques to Voronoi meshes, introduced a simple improvement to barycentric velocity interpolation for Voronoi/Delaunay meshes, and extended the ghost fluid surface tension model with mesh-based curvature in order to capture complex capillary waves with minimal damping.
Pursuing a more efficient, fully implicit surface tension model is a promising future direction. Obvious optimizations include: reducing the number of tetrahedra through smarter sampling, improving the broad phase algorithm for point-location queries, and streamlining the construction of mesh data structures.
