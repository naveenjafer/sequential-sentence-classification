We present a technique for automatically synthesizing walking and running controllers for physically-simulated 3D humanoid characters. The sagittal hip, knee, and ankle degrees-of-freedom are actuated using a set of eight Hill-type musculotendon models in each leg, with biologically-motivated control laws. In this work we are particularly interested in comparing our results to the mean and standard deviation curves for the  sagittal hip, knee, and ankle joints for multiple subjects over multiple walking and running speeds.The parameters of these controllers (sagittal hip, knee, and ankle joints,etc.) are optimized to satisfy a set of high-level task terms while minimizing an effort term based on modeling the rate of metabolic energy expenditure.
The main contribution to our effort measurement is the total rate of metabolic energy expenditure ( E) ? over all MTUs.We show that the use of biologically-based actuators and objectives measurably increases the realism of gaits generated by locomotion controllers that operate without the use of motion capture data, and that metabolic energy expenditure provides a simple and unifying measurement of effort that can be used for both walking and running control optimization.Moreover, A major artifact from all of the previous works is the lack of hip extension during mid-gait, which does not occur in our result
