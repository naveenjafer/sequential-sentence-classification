This work presented a biologically-motivated control parameterization that can be used to automatically generate 3D human-like walking and running controllers of different speeds. The lower body of the humanoid model is actuated with a set of Hill-type musculotendon units (MTUs). For the upper body and the remaining DOFs in the lower body, a pose-graph controller is introduced. These musculotendon units generate torques for the most important degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) during locomotionâ€” the sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle DOFs. To actuate these muscles, biologically-motivated control functions are defined to map the current state of the body (joint angles, muscle fiber lengths, etc.) to excitation signals. Controllers are optimized to satisfy a set of high-level task terms while minimizing an effort term based on modeling the rate of metabolic energy expenditure. The result is a locomotion control optimization procedure that minimizes a physiologically-based objective within a parameter space restricted to biologically plausible torque patterns. The resulting gaits match human ground truth to a greater extent than state-of-the-art walking controllers that do not rely on motion capture data. This work demonstrates that measurable increase in locomotion realism can be produced by employing musculotendon actuators for a small subset of the body DOFs. Current implementation is limited to modelling the character's walking on a straight line and flat ground. Future work include synthesizing motion with more detailed, fully muscle-actuated human models, and developing predictive biomechanical models to investigate the effects of muscle and control properties on gait.
