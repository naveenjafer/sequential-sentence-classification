A OMR algorithm that preserves the high frequency content of the motion quite well, since inverse rate control is directed by Jacobian values has been proposed. The problem we try to solve in this paper can be summarized as: ( 1 ) finding in real-time the motion retargetted to a new character that has different anthropometric proportions, and ( 2 ) at the same time, preserving the features of the original motion during the retargetting.  ( 3 ) As a by-product, it is possible to use the above retargetting algorithm for enhancing motion capture data so that the errors in joint angles and end-effector positions are reduced.  If a high quality character animation has to be produced during a short period of time, motion capture might be a most reasonable choice these days. If the retargetting can be done in on-line, real-time performance can be mapped to another character, or the feedback of the retargetted animation can facilitate motion capture session so that satisfactory results can be obtained with fewer trials. Our on-line motion retargetting produces satisfactory results in retargetting most human or creature motion. If the technique is well utilized, it can be very useful to people in character animation and game industries.
