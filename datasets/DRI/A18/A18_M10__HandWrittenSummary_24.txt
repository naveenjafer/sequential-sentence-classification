This paper presented the on-line motion retargetting (OMR) technique based on inverse rate control. The method is an improvement over the off-line retargetting based on spacetime constraints since real-time performances can be retargetted without degradation of retargetting quality. On-line motion retargetting presented in this paper is based on inverse rate control, which is a way to implement inverse kinematics based on Jacobian. It computes the changes in joint angles corresponding to the changes in end-effector position. While tracking the multiple end-effector trajectories of the original subject or character,  OMR imitates the joint motion of the original character by exploiting the kinematic redundancies of the animated model. The new method is an improvement over the existing interpolation/regression method in three aspects: ( 1 ) inverse kinematics is done at every frame, which promises much closer end-effector tracking, ( 2 ) the joint angle imitation is done by exploiting redundant degrees of freedom rather than depending on the least square fit, and ( 3 ) the high frequency component of the original motion is preserved much better in the new method. The OMR technique greatly helps to get more satisfactory results in motion capturing with fewer trials by giving the real-time feedback to the performer. Furthermore, the captured data can be enhanced in both end-effector positions and joint angles by going through the OMR filter. A limitation of this method is that there is no easy way to guarantee full-proof stability of the system due to the non-linearity.
