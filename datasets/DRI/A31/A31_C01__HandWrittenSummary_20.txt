Simulating the cloth behaviour has been a challenging task for the graphics research community for several decades. Even though there were a notable number of approach to simulate cloth behaviour, the question of how to achieve real-time performance in cloth simulation has largely been ignored. In this work, the authors proposed a novel data driven method for simulating clothes worn by 3D characters in real time. Geometric based simulation are much less complex than the physics based deformation technique. So this work focuses on analysing the pre-simulated sequence to identify the region largely explained by joint movement and simplification by constructing  a coarse mesh representation of the garment which can be represented by geometric based deformation. A number of intelligent techniques, such as simplified mass spring system, implicit Euler integrator have been adopted and implemented to save computation time and complexity in simulations. The method also saves significant computation by enclosing each vertex into collision hull which is rigidly attached to the skeleton. In the second level of simulation, the wrinkles and folds of the cloths are detected and reconstructed using linear interpolation. The results shows that the proposed data driven method can efficiently handle real time simulation of variety of clothes such as evening and cocktail dress and jeans as well as those with stiff mechanical properties. Most interesting feature of the work s that in can construct a model for real time animation fully automatically and adapt to various cloths type without significantly increasing the computational load.
