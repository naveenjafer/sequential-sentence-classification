A data-driven method for real time simulation of 3D characters is presented. A simulator learning strategy is adopted based on a pre-simulated analysis of the cloth to-be-animated sequence associated with skin surface. Areas with high cloth to movement interaction are identified so as to reduce physics based simulation in favor of geometric approximation and lower computation needs. A coarse mesh representation of the cloth is used to make physics-based simulations of cloth behavior. Pre-simulated cloth animation sequence data are used to post-correct position or velocity aspects of the coarse mesh, to identify the collision hall areas only on which collision tests will be made and train wrinkle generation on the fine mesh using geometrical approximations. The simulator behaves fairly well for a variety of clothes except of tight ones due to approximate handling of collision detection.The results are realistic, produced with no user intervention and with optimized computational needs, given that the simulatorsâ€™ input is within the range of the pre-simulated data for which it has been trained.
