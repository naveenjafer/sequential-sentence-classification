This paper constructs statistical models from motion capture data and then combine these models with trajectory optimization to generate a motion that satisfies user-defined constraints.  The statistical dynamic equations, together with an automatically derived objective function and user-defined constraints, comprise a trajectory optimization problem. The optimization problem is solved using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Solving this optimization problem in the low dimensional space yields optimal, natural motion that achieves the goals specified by the user. The combination of the motion prior and the userâ€™s constraints provides sufficient information to produce motion with a natural appearance. Two kinds of constraints, key-frame constraints and key-trajectory constraints, can be used separately or in collectively. The proposed models are capable of generating both full-body movement and facial expression from spatial-temporal constraints while matching the statistical properties of a database of captured motion. This statistically based optimization approach complements a physically based optimization approach and offers a few potential advantages, such as faster convergence, being less subject to local minima and generating stylized motions. The system is able to adapt to different characters and environments. There are two limitations of our approach: an appropriate database must be available and the user cannot specify such dynamic constraints as ground reaction forces or character mass. One of immediate directions for future work is, therefore, to design intuitive interfaces that allow the user to specify spatial-temporal constraints quickly and easily.
