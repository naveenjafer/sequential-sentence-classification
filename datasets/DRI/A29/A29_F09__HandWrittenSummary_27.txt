This paper presents a GPU friendly, Eulerian, free surface fluid simulation method that conserves mass locally and globally without the use of Lagrangian components. Local mass conservation prevents small scale details of the free surface from disappearing, a problem that plagues many previous approaches, while global mass conservation ensures that the total volume of the liquid does not decrease over time. Their method handles moving solid boundaries as well as cells that are partially filled with solids. Due to its stability, it allows the use of large time steps which makes it suitable for both off-line and real-time applications. They achieve this by using density based surface tracking with a novel, unconditionally stable, conservative advection scheme and a novel interface sharpening method. While their approach conserves mass, volume loss is still possible but only temporarily. With constant mass, local volume loss causes a local increase of the density used for surface tracking which they detect and correct over time. They also propose a density post-processing method to reveal sub-grid details of the liquid surface. They show the effectiveness of the proposed method in several practical examples all running either at interactive rates or in real-time.
