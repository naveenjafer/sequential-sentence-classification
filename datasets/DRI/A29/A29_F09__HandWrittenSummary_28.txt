This paper proposed a new sharpening method which conserves mass both locally and globally. The authors ave demonstrated the strength of our technique in various scenarios. With their approach they were able to create, for the first time, a 3d water demo that is both simulated and ray-traced in real time. At the same time, the density post processing method proposed in this work is an effective way to alleviate this effect. Their method has its limitations as well. Even though this method cannot guarantee complete volume conservation at all times, it reduces this problem significantly in comparison to all the previous methods we have investigated.
