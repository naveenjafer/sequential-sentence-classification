This paper presents a GPU friendly, Eulerian, free surface fluid simulation method that conserves mass locally and globally without the Lagrangian components. Local mass conservation prevents small scale details of the free surface from disappearing, a problem that plagues many previous approaches, while global mass conservation ensures the total volume of the liquid does not decrease over time. Additional novel steps handle non-axis aligned and moving solid boundaries that are partially filled with solids. Due to its stability, it allows the use of large time steps which makes it suitable for both off-line and real-time applications. It is achieved by using density based surface tracking with a novel, unconditionally stable, conservative advection scheme and a novel interface sharpening method.  An alternative to the sharpening method is to perform anti-diffusion step which is an interesting avenue for future work. While the approach conserves mass, volume loss is possible but only temporarily. The density post processing method is an effective way to alleviate this effect. Even though this method cannot guarantee complete volume conservation at all times, it reduces this problem significantly in comparison to the previous methods they have investigated. With constant mass, local volume loss causes a local increase of the density used for surface tracking which is detected and corrected over time. They also propose a density post-processing method to reveal sub-grid details of the liquid surface. They show the effectiveness of the method in several practical examples all running either at interactive rates or in real-time.
