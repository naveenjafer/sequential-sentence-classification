        <H1>3 Background</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In the field of computer graphics, the technique described in <CitSpan>[Carlson et al., 2002]</CitSpan> is perhaps closest in intent to the method we describe here.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Like us, they were interested in modeling materials with properties intermediate between solids and fluids using an Eulerian grid-based fluid simulation method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">However, they opt to map the continuum between fluids and solids to varying viscosity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In their system a solid is simply a fluid with very high viscosity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">This approach ignores the elastic behavior demonstrated by many materials.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Nevertheless, they do generate nice results for highly viscous fluids, and they describe an implicit integration method for coping with stability issues arising from very high viscosities.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Other graphics researchers have used particle-based methods for modeling highly viscous fluids and for modeling fluids with some form of elasticity.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In <CitSpan>[Terzopoulos et al., 1989]</CitSpan> the authors modeled melting thermoelastic materials.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The particles exerted cohesive, viscous, and volume-preserving forces on their neighbors.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">While solid, each particle was connected to a fixed set of neighbors using elastic springs.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">As the material would become more fluid-like, the springs would weaken, and eventually disappear.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">By varying the elastic properties of the materials, this method could model a range of behaviors, but without plasticity, it could not model materials, like clay, that flow into a new configuration and then resist changes from that configuration.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Similar approaches using different particle formulations have appeared in <CitSpan>[Desbrun and Gascuel, 1995], [Desbrun and Cani, 1996], [Cani and Desbrun, 1997]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[Stora et al., 1999]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The method appearing in <CitSpan>[Desbrun and Gascuel, 1995]</CitSpan> used elastic forces with dynamically determined neighbors to allow behavior that is similar to plastic flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Perhaps the greatest limitation on the level of realism achievable by these particle methods was the relatively small number of particles used.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">However, as processor speeds have increased, particle-based methods have been able to achieve increasingly impressive results.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Compelling real-time results for modestly sized systems appear in <CitSpan>[Müller et al., 2003]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[Premo ze et al., 2003]</CitSpan> demonstrates off-line results that are comparable to the current best grid-based methods.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Although both of these recent methods focus on strictly liquid behavior, they could be extended along lines similar to what we propose here.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Some methods for modeling solids have dealt with limited amounts of plastic flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Both <CitSpan>[Terzopoulos and Fleischer, 1988a] and [Terzopoulos and Fleischer, 1988b]</CitSpan> describe transition to plastic flow based on von Mises’s yield condition, and <CitSpan>[O’Brien et al., 2002]</CitSpan> used a similar plasticity model for ductile fracture behavior.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We use the same yield condition of von Mises, but we do not assume that plastic flow occurs instantaneously.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Instead we use a more complex model that accommodates phenomena such as creep.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Additionally, these prior methods used Lagrangian meshes with largely fixed topology, and so they would have encountered “tangling” difficulties, such as inverting elements, for large amounts of plastic flow.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Another, rather interesting, approach to combining solid and fluid behaviors appears in <CitSpan>[Nixon and Lobb, 2002]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">They surround a fluid simulation with an elastic membrane.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The result is an object that behaves somewhat like a water balloon.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Our work builds directly on previous grid-based, Eulerian methods for animating fluids with free surfaces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Details on these methods can be found in <CitSpan>[Foster and Metaxas, 1996], [Stam, 1999], [Foster and Fedkiw, 2001]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[Enright et al., 2002]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">In particular, our work essentially extends <CitSpan>[Enright et al., 2002]</CitSpan> to include the behavior of viscoelastic fluids.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Outside the graphics field, viscoelastic materials have been studied extensively.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">We refer the reader to the texts <CitSpan>[Fung, 1965], [Han and Reddy, 1999]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[ Bird et al., 1987 ]</CitSpan> for detailed descriptions of several different models for viscoelastic and elastoplastic materials.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The general approaches we use for introducing elastic forces into the Navier-Stokes equations, and integrating and advecting strain are not completely novel.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Some recent examples of fluid simulation outside the graphics literature that involve elastic forces include <CitSpan>[Gerritsma, 1996], [Tomé et al., 2002]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[ Bonito et al., 2003 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">A detailed analysis of two-dimensional simulations of viscoelastic fluids on staggered rectilinear grids appears in <CitSpan>[Gerritsma, 1996]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The three-dimensional method we use for storing rank-two tensor quantities on a staggered grid is a generalization of their two-dimensional method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">In <CitSpan>[ Bonito et al., 2003 ]</CitSpan> a combination of rectilinear grids and finite elements are used with a volume-of-fluid method to model three-dimensional fluids with elastic properties.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">They do not include plasticity and they store all quantities at cell centers.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">The marker-andcell based method in <CitSpan>[Tomé et al., 2002]</CitSpan> is another example solving viscoelastic free-surface flows.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">They address issues relating to elastic-stress based boundary conditions at rigidbody and free-surfaces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Although they use a staggered grid for the velocity field, they still store their tensor values at cell centers.</Sentence>
      
      
        <H1>4 Simulation Methods</H1>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The framework we use for fluid simulation is based on the method described in <CitSpan>[Enright et al., 2002]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">This framework consists of two primary components which work together to produce useful results.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The first is a rectilinear grid that stores the values that define the fluid’s state.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The values on the grid change as forces act on the fluid, and they also change as the fluid moves through the space delineated by the grid.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The second component is a function whose levelset at zero locates the boundaries of the fluid.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The function is represented using a combination of particles and values defined on a second rectilinear grid.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">The particles and grid values evolve based on the motion of the fluid.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">A full description of this type of system is beyond the scope of this paper, so we focus on the changes we make to accommodate viscoelastic behavior.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">We suggest the following references for a more complete description of this simulation methodology: <CitSpan>[Foster and Metaxas, 1996], [Stam, 1999], [Foster and Fedkiw, 2001]</CitSpan>, and <CitSpan>[Enright et al., 2002]</CitSpan>.</Sentence>

          Figure 2: This figure demonstrates some effects achieved by varying α and γ. Each image shows a cube of material that has been dropped onto a hard surface inside an invisible box. The rightmost images show a low viscosity simple fluid and an extremely viscous simple fluid for comparison. The viscoelastic examples have the same viscosity as the low viscosity fluid.

        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We have implemented this method for modeling viscoelastic behavior and used it to generate several example animations.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">Most of these examples were selected to illustrate some interesting aspect of viscoelastic fluid behavior.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">All of the examples shown in this paper also appear on the accompanying video, which also contains additional examples.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Figures 1 and 3 show several splashes that are generated when a fluid sphere is hurled into a tank containing the same material.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The motion of the pure fluid example differs substantially from the viscoelastic examples.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Additionally, the surfaces of the viscoelastic examples retain evidence of the impact even after motion has stopped.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Figure 4 shows jets of different fluids sprayed into a closed container.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Again, the behavior of simple and viscoelastic fluids differ substantially.</Sentence>

          Figure 6:
        
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">These additional examples of viscoelastic fluids draining from a tank show a range of different behaviors.</Sentence>
        <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Figures 5 and 6 illustrate some of the variation in viscoelastic fluid behaviors.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">In Figure 5 , fluid draining from a tank forms a thin stream that forms a spiral pattern as it piles.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The examples in Figure 6 billow up around the downward stream, create a folding pattern, and break apart into gobs.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">A simply viscous fluid would merely flow out to fill the container.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The drip examples in Figures 7 and 8 show the behavior of a gob of material that has been stuck to the underside of a horizontal surface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The effect of shape memory created by the elastic forces can be seen in these images.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">Some of the images in Figure 2 show similar behavior that occurs when cubes of different materials are dropped onto a hard surface.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The examples with high yield strain, i.e. large γ, behave like deformable solids and bounce.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">As shown in Figure 9 , we can also model highly deformable, sticky objects that interact with each other.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">When the spheres collide, their level-set surfaces merge so that they adhere.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The fluid retains its momentum, generating the resulting spinning and stretching motion.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Close examination shows that the spheres slightly anticipate their collision.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This error occurs because the surfaces begin to interact through shared ghost cells.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">The images in Figure 10 are still images from an animation we produced using this simulation method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Unspecified">These examples demonstrate viscoelastic fluids interacting with interesting geometry.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">All of the images were rendered with a standard Newtoniteration based ray marching algorithm implemented in the open source renderer Pixie developed by Okan Arikan.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_FutureWork">While ray marching produces nice results we think they might be improved using the method described in <CitSpan>[Heckbert, 1987]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Some of our examples suffer from noticeable volume loss.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">This occurs because, while the particle level-set method does a nice job modeling moderately thick volumes of fluids, very thin surfaces, or strands, still have a tendency to vanish.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">These effects are particularly noticeable visually when the fluid is moving in orderly fashion, as opposed to splashing about chaotically.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">It is difficult to say if this behavior is a deficiency in our implementation or a limitation of the surface tracking method.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The speed of this simulation method is approximately the same with and without the addition of elastic forces.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">For example, one of the falling cube examples on a 40 3 grid requires about half an hour of computation per second of animation on a single 3 GHz Pentium 4 processor.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Approach">We are using an explicit integration method for the viscous and elastic forces, so very high viscous or elastic coefficients would probably cause stability problems and force smaller time steps.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_FutureWork">If it became an issue, that difficulty could be ameliorated somewhat with an implicit integration scheme.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">The material can be made to adhere to or slip off of boundary surfaces by adjusting the velocity or pressure constraints enforced along closed boundaries.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">However, in our current implementation all fluids will stick to each other because different surface components merge when they collide.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">For the fluids we show in our examples, this behavior is a desirable feature.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">However, for non-sticky materials, like cold gelatin, it would be undesirable.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_FutureWork">To a large extent, our method for incorporating elastoplastic terms does not depend on the underlying fluid simulation method, and one could easily adapt the method to other fluid simulation techniques such as smoothed-particle hydrodynamics.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Furthermore, we found that once we already had a working fluid simulation, adding the elastoplastic terms was fairly easy.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Finally, we note that while the method we present can model a wide range of phenomena, many real materials can demonstrate behaviors not captured by this model.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Background">Biological fluids, such as blood, can exhibit many interesting effects that arise from their microscopic structure.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="DRI_Outcome">Even relatively simple polymer suspensions can demonstrate behavior that can only be roughly captured with this model.</Sentence> <Sentence inAbstract="false" rhetoricalClass="Sentence">Quoting from <CitSpan>[ Bird et al., 1987 ]</CitSpan>: A fluid that’s macromolecular Is really quite weird — in particular The abnormal stresses The fluid possesses Give rise to effects quite spectacular.</Sentence>
