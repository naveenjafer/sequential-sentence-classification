This paper describes a technique for animating the behavior of materials, which exhibit a combination of both fluid and solid characteristics. The technique builds on prior Eulerian methods for animating incompressible fluids with free surfaces. The framework used for fluid simulation consists of two primary components: the first is a rectilinear grid that stores the values that define the fluid’s state; the second component is a function whose levelset at zero locates the boundaries of the fluid. they use a particle-level-set method for tracking the fluid’s free surface, but with the substantially faster, though less accurate, method. The behavior of the viscoelastic fluid is governed by a modified version of the Navier-Stokes equations that includes an additional term for elastic stress. This paper also concerned about how the elastic strain changes due to plastic yielding. Strain is computed by integrating strain-rate and advecting the results because the fluid simulations do not make use of an explicit reference configuration. The transition from elastic resistance to viscous flow is controlled by von Mises’s yield condition, and subsequent behavior is then governed by a quasi-linear plasticity model.

This paper generate several example animations of viscoelastic behavior. The speed of this simulation method is approximately the same with and without the addition of elastic forces. This method for incorporating elastoplastic terms does not depend on the underlying fluid simulation method, and researchers could easily adapt the method to other fluid simulation techniques such as smoothed-particle hydrodynamics.
