This paper presents an approach to physically based optimization that is efficient and appears to scale well to more complex characters. The authors use a standard problem formulationâ€”iteratively adjust character motion to meet animator constraints and minimize an objective function. This method is based on restricting the definition of this optimization problem to constraints and objective functions that can be differentiated in time linear in the degrees of freedom of the character. Obtaining these derivatives is a computational bottleneck, and complex derivatives can lead to poor optimization performance and problems with local minima. The fact that first derivatives can be computed in linear time instead of quadratic time suggests that this problem is simpler than previous physically based approaches and similar in complexity to very successful kinematic approaches such as minimizing distance to a reference motion. Physics constraints for the motions in the presented examples are categorized as flight, bar contact, and ground contact. The argument and implementation is constructed around a NewtonEuler formulation of inverse dynamics. With this objective function and our linear time algorithm for computing the constraint Jacobian, physically based optimization can be performed for a 22 degree of freedom character at interactive speeds. Incorporating physics constraints into traditionally kinematic animation approaches is one direction of future work.
