This paper presents an approach to physically based optimization that is efficient and appears to scale well to more complex characters.   We use a standard problem formulationâ€”iteratively adjust character motion to meet animator constraints and minimize an objective function.  Our approach is based on restricting the definition of this optimization problem to constraints and objective functions that can be differentiated in time linear in the degrees of freedom of the character.  In this paper, we describe how the Newton-Euler equations of motion can be rewritten to allow first derivatives of aggregate forces and torques to be computed in linear time. 

This paper describes how a broad range of physics constraints can be expressed based on aggregate forces and torques applied to the character, and how expressing physics constraints in this way allows us to compute the constraint Jacobian in linear time.  With the designed objective function and our linear time algorithm for computing the constraint Jacobian, we are able to show that physically based optimization can be performed for a 22 degree of freedom character at interactive speeds.

This paper contributes to physically based optimization by defining and exploring a restricted class of optimization problems where physics constraints are included and first derivatives of constraints and objective functions can be computed in linear time.
