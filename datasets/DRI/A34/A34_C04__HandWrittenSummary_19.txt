The paper presents a new collision resolution method for cloth resolution in Computer Graphics. Collision resolution is to find the correct next positions and velocities of colliding objects.  Cloth-cloth resolution, where a group of particles are colliding into each other, is handled as a special case of deformable N-body collision resolution. More specifically, the colliding particles are first divided into parts and the collision relationship of these parts is used to build a system of linear equations, adapting the scheme from the simultaneous resolution method for rigid N-body collisions proposed by Baraff [1].The innovation of the proposed cloth collision resolution method is that it introduces cloth-cloth particlesâ€™ momentum conservation, utilizing the law of N-body momentum conservation to solve the linear equations system. In this way, realistic cloth interactions and visually realistic cloth interactions are achieved.
In the special case of cyclic collisions in an area where multiple self-collisions occurs, a system of linear inequalities between the relative velocities of grouped particle parts before and after collision is used.  Although it is an artificial relationship set up heuristically and not based on physics, it appears to give graphically realistic results.
