        <H1>1. Introduction</H1>
      
      <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">Collision handling in Computer Graphics has two phases.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">One is to detect collisions and the other is to resolve collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">In cloth collision detection, the computation time to detect collisions is not negligible because the number of geometrical entities (nodes, faces, edges) the collision detection algorithm has to handle is considerable (over 10,000 particles for regular attire).</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">For this reason, several approaches have tried to expedite the collision detection processes <CitSpan>[ 16 , 3 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Collision resolution is to find the correct next positions and velocities of colliding objects.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">Cloth resolution methods so far have found non-penetrating positions, velocities and accelerations of cloth surface particles <CitSpan>[ 14 , 3 , 15 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">This scheme works fine for cloth-rigid collisions and for the special case of cloth-cloth collisions where the dynamic interactions between cloth surfaces in cloth-cloth collisions do not have to be noticeable.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">Volino et. al. <CitSpan>[ 15 ]</CitSpan> applied the conjugate gradient method to find the actual particles’ positions where a group of particles are colliding into each other.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">By preserving barycentric relationships of collision entities, their method resolves collisions where numerous cloth surfaces are colliding together as a group, which is a novel way to resolve multiple collisions at once.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">However it does not conserve the momentum of cloth surfaces in cloth-cloth collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Another method for cloth-cloth collisions has been proposed by Provot <CitSpan>[ 12 ]</CitSpan>, which resolves collisions by giving an average velocity to all the particles of collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE_DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Provot’s method is easy to implement but it cannot give proper visual effect of collisions since we cannot get dynamic interactions between particles once the particles collide into each other.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Cloth-cloth collision resolution is a special case of deformable N-body collision resolution.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NOVELTY" inAbstract="false">To solve deformable N-body collision resolutions, we propose a new collision resolution method which gives a visually reasonable response by ensuring the conservation of N-body momentums.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">Our cloth system is particle-based, as many systems are in other cloth research groups <CitSpan>[ 14 , 6 , 12 , 3 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">To resolve collisions, we first divide the colliding particles into parts and build a system of linear equations based on the collision relationships between these parts.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Then we solve the whole system using the law of N-body momentum conservation.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The system of equalities is based on the scheme adapted from the simultaneous resolution method for rigid N-body collisions proposed by Baraff <CitSpan>[ 1 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">However his original inequality relationships between relative velocities before and after collisions are purely heuristic, which may not be physically correct.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE_ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Though this physical inaccuracy has been an inherent problem of simultaneous collision resolutions, it appears to give graphically agreeable results.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Hence with the help of the law of N-body momentum conservation, we found the results of our resolutions are visually acceptable.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In the next section, we discuss the issues involved in collision detection, especially to define a way to store collision information.</Sentence> In Sec. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">3, we propose our collision resolution scheme.</Sentence> In Sec. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">3.1 and 3.2, we examine some special cases of collisions which need some prior processes before we actually resolve collisions.</Sentence> From Sec. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">3.3 to Sec.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">3.5, the actual collision resolution method is presented.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Finally Sec.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">4 discusses results.</Sentence>

          <H2>2.1 Collision detection using swept-volumes</H2>
          <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">A swept volume is a volume made by two sets of positional entities of a face one at time t and one at time t + t .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Connecting these old and new positions of all particles in a face gives us a volume.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Any collision happening within an integration time step always can be detected by this swept volume method, unless the motions of faces are highly rotational.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An interesting case is where the faces are not actually intersecting but two swept volumes report a intersection anyway.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Though this case is not an actual collision, it happens only when two faces are very close.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Hence we resort to the collision report of this case, since we consider this case as a violation of the proximity law.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">We use classical edge-polygon detection algorithms to detect collisions among swept volumes.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">We use this swept volume approach for cloth and the dynamic rigid body alike, but for the non-moving rigid body only the surface faces are used for collision detection.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">In addition, we add proximity regions to the normal directions of faces of a swept volume to add proximity violation regions.</Sentence>

          <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Though detected collisions are reported as pairs of face-face, we cannot respond to each collision individually since these individual responses may introduce another new collision or one face may possibly be related to several other collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">So we save all detected collisions in a data structure, i.e. a set of zones of impact <CitSpan>[ 12 ]</CitSpan> during the collision detection phase.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">All stored detected collisions will be resolved comprehensively by the rule described in the next section.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Originally a zone of impact (IZ) is an area where multiple self-collisions occur <CitSpan>[ 12 ]</CitSpan>.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NOVELTY" inAbstract="false">We extend Provot’s definition of an IZ to an area where collisions happen, including collisions against bodies and self-collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An object O is a set of particles, faces, and edges, where faces and edges are defined based on the positions of particles by the rule comprising cloth surface.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An area A is a subset of O such that all the particles and edges constituting a face in A are members of A .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An area A is called separable when, for all faces 2 A , does not collide with any face in A .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An area A is called colliding when, for all faces 2 A , collides with at least one face in A .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An IZ is a separable colliding area.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Fig. 1 shows a cross section view of a collision situation where three cases of IZs are shown by dotted circles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">An area A is called visitable when, for all particles P 2 A , P can be encountered by traversing from any other particle in A using edges in A .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Otherwise, the area A is non-visitable.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">We call a visitable subset area of an IZ a collision cluster (CC).</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">When a face-face collision is detected, the entities of each colliding face (the particle and the edges of , and itself) are inserted into a CC, where the CC can be encountered by traversing from the particles in using only edges in .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">When there is no such CC, becomes a CC.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">When two or more such CCs are found, these CCs are merged into one CC connected by .</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In Fig. 1 , a CC is denoted as a shaded area.</Sentence>
        
      
      <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">A widely used method for detecting cloth collisions is to put small repellent proximity forces between the cloth surface and the rigid or cloth surface <CitSpan>[ 4 , 14 , 3 ]</CitSpan> while the actual collisions are tested with pairs of particle-face or face-face of the current positions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">When objects are moving fast, however, these preventive proximity forces cannot prevent collisions since a particle can pass through the proximity violation region during one integration time step.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This problem can be negligible when the integration time step is very small, so we rarely have those pass-through cases.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">However since implicit integration methods <CitSpan>[ 3 , 5 , 7 ]</CitSpan> have been used times for as cloth large simulations, as to meet the the frame time step rate has of 30 become 1 sec/frame.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">larger, Consesomequently this penetration problem is no longer negligible, so we use the swept volume approach <CitSpan>[ 13 , 8 ]</CitSpan> which will be described in the next section.</Sentence>

        <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Numerous approaches <CitSpan>[ 14 , 12 , 3 , 15 ]</CitSpan> have been introduced for cloth collision resolution: the correct next positions and velocities of colliding cloth particles.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">So far, however, no cloth collision resolution method which considers cloth-cloth momentum conservation has been introduced, while we cannot achieve realistic cloth interactions in cloth animation without conserving cloth-cloth momentums.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Having this characteristic is visually distinctive when cloth surfaces are moving fast and interact with each other.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="COMMON_PRACTICE" inAbstract="false">For rigid N-body collisions by graphics and robotics groups <CitSpan>[ 11 , 1 , 10 , 9 ]</CitSpan> and for flexible-rigid collision resolution <CitSpan>[ 2 ]</CitSpan>, several approaches have been suggested.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">But they are not directly applicable for deformable N-body collision resolutions, which is the case cloth requires.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Cloth resolution methods so far compute non-penetrating positions, velocities or accelerations of particles <CitSpan>[ 14 , 3 , 15 ]</CitSpan>, which work fine for the collisions against fixed bodies.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Using these methods, however, we cannot achieve visually satisfying dynamics of cloth-cloth collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Adjusting particle orientations after collision resolution as suggested by <CitSpan>[ 14 ]</CitSpan> to sustain the geometrical consistency of colliding faces also does not warrant reasonable dynamic movements of cloth-cloth collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="DISADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Handling collisions in an IZ as a bundle, proposed by Provot <CitSpan>[ 12 ]</CitSpan>, also does not give a proper visual effect.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Since all particles are given the same velocities after collision resolution, particles tend to get stuck once they collide into each other in an IZ.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NOVELTY" inAbstract="false">We propose our cloth collision resolution method which resolves simultaneous collisions while ensuring conservation of momentum as accurately as possible.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="ADVANTAGE" inAbstract="false">Since simultaneous resolution does not blindly resolve a collision without considering neighboring collisions within an IZ, we do not introduce any new collisions while resolving a collision.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">The collision resolution module receives collision information as a set of IZs as described in Sec.</Sentence> 2.2. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">Within an IZ, where possibly multiple collisions reside, collisions are resolved simultaneously as described in Sec.</Sentence> 3.4. <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">After we handle each IZ separately, we check whether any new collisions between IZs are introduced by collision resolutions, and handle them if there are any.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In an IZ, we first check whether it has CCs from rigid bodies.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">In case we do not find any CCs from rigid bodies, the collisions in that IZ are categorized as cloth-cloth collisions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">If we find CCs from rigid bodies in an IZ, we extract them temporarily from the IZ so that only cloth-cloth collisions remain in the IZ.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">After resolving these cloth-cloth collisions, we take care of cloth collisions against rigid bodies so that the resolutions against rigid bodies will be done on top of the result of self-collision resolutions.</Sentence> <Sentence aspectClass="NONE" inAbstract="false">This sequence of resolutions is chosen to avoid the case where self-collisions are ignored while collisions against rigid bodies are handled.</Sentence>
