In this paper we present a novel method for creating synthesizing streams of motions based on a corpus of captured movement while preserving the quality of the original data. Given a corpus of motion capture data, we automatically construct a directed graph called a motion graph that encapsulates connections among the database. The motion graph consists both of pieces of original motion and automatically generated transitions. Motion  transform the motion synthesis problem into one of selecting sequences of nodes, or graph walks. In other word, Motion graphs transform the motion synthesis problem into one of selecting sequences of nodes, or graph walks.Hence we focus instead on local search methods that try to find a satisfactory graph walk within a reasonable amount of time.

We present a general framework for extracting particular graph walks that meet a userâ€™s specifications. We then show how this framework can be applied to the specific problem of generating different styles of locomotion along arbitrary paths. One limitation of our approach is that the transition thresholds must be specified by hand, since (as discussed in Section 3.2) different kinds of motions have different fidelity requirements.
