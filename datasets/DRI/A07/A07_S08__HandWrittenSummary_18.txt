In this paper, we introduce a novel method called curve skeleton skinning, to overcome the persisting drawbacks of joint skeleton skinning.
The basic idea is to represent the relationship between the skeletal movements and the skin deformation in a non-linear continuous fashion.

Using our technique, the animator is able to work without digressing from the familiarity of the current joint-based system, but at the same time achieves maximum visual realism in terms of skin deformation.

The main advantage of this technique is its consistency with the current animation production practice and the ability to overcome the undesirable drawbacks of skeleton-driven skinning.
 Through a combination of existing practices and newly designed ones, we have successfully created a fusion, which maximizes the efficiency of surface deformation during animation.
Our current implementation allows both skin and muscle deformation to be modeled within a unified framework.
