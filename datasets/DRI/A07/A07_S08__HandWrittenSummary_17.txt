This paper introduces a novel method called curve skeleton skinning, to overcome the persisting drawbacks of joint skeleton skinning.  The main advantage of this technique is its consistency with the current animation production practice and the ability to overcome the undesirable drawbacks of skeleton-driven skinning.    Curve skeleton based skinning considers skinning as a proper non-linear problem.  The basic idea is to represent the relationship between the skeletal movements and the skin deformation in a non-linear continuous fashion.  Skin deformation is achieved using the traditional smooth skinning technique; however, a character will have two skeletons: the ordinary joint skeleton and a curve skeleton.  While the joint skeleton is a discrete center line representation of an object, the curve skeleton offers a continuous skeletal representation.  The curve skeleton being continuous gives the maximum sampling rate and provides skin deformation transformation without any artifacts.  In effect, the curve skeleton is equipped with an infinite number of joints, which will influence the skin deformation.  The new method enhances the current joint skinning system using the curve skeleton skinning and retains the current animation production pattern that the animators are familiar with.  By layering the curve skeleton on top of the existing joint skeleton, the animator can work conventionally (as in a joint-based system) and yet receive good results.   In addition, the proposed curve skeleton can realistically deform not only the skin directly, but also the muscles, in a unified manner.  The computation speed is slightly faster than that of the traditional smooth skinning technique.
