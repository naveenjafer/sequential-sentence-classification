In nowadays, cloth simulators for animation, visual effects, games, and apparel design can mimic real cloth to a high degree of fidelity. But to fully exploit their capabilities, the constitutive models for cloth deformation must be tuned with great care.
This paper presents a new, general system for observing cloth properties that measures more complete data than previous work in cloth capture or textile testing, and second, a new method for fitting parametric models to this type of data.
This general fitting method, is suited for the vast majority of existing cloth models that leverages equilibrium conditions to guide the iteration. The 3D surface construction method which is produced following the presented method, rather than a 2D deformation, it can measures all forces applied to the cloth as they change during a range of different deformations. The fitted models are then evaluated by comparison to measured deformations with motions very different from those used for fitting. The presented measurement setup offers very accurate control over membrane deformations, but the bending tests require manual intervention and are thus less precise.
