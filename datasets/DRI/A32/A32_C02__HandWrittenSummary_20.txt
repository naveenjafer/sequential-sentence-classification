Modeling fashion garments using computer animation is a growing trend as it adds life to garments in fashion. To make the garment look realistic, the designer must add natural wrinkles to it. But this task is not trivial as wrinkles are mainly formed because of buckling and characterized by the friction between body and the garment. Moreover, wrinkle pattern changes continuously with strain. Traditional approach to animate such complex phenomenon requires much computational power, taking huge amount of time. This paper introduces a novel algorithm to animate realistic wrinkles in an efficient manner which enables to model wrinkles interactively. For this purpose, the authors takes geometry and texture based approach instead of traditional high density triangle based approach. This algorithm is based on the fact that, the area of a piece of cloth remains constant inspite of its physical deformation. The derived algorithm interactively animates realistic multifold wrinkles following users design. The calculations of the wrinkling coefficients are done on a per triangle basis  and therefore the computational time is linear with respect to number of triangles. Apart from fashion garments, current method can also be readily applied to any deformable object. Further improvement to this approach can be made by finding a method to create wrinkle patterns from strain map.
