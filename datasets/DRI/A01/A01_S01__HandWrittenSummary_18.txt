Our goal is to incorporate example based skinning into a system having a variety of other skinning and deformation operations, and to be able to invert these operations regardless of their nature.

we propose a unified skinning framework by applying minimization theory with respect to other basic skinning schemes.

By formulating the inverse process as a minimization problem we propose a unified model not only for SSD but also for other skinning schemes, into which shape interpolation can be incorporated.

Inverse skinning integrates SSD and shape interpolation more firmly than its forward rival.

We demonstrate the direction of deformed vertex in inverse skinning is linearly proportional to joint rotations in a simplified example, while the forward PSD does not incorporate the direction information.


For a simplified condition where only one joint rotation and two example poses are considered, we demonstrate this inverse strategy has a better performance than the same framework without it.

Therefore the inverse approach presents better performance and more consistent interpolation
