Skeleton Subspace deformation (SSD) is the most common method of skinning.  In SSD, each skin vertex is related to one of more points on an articulated skeleton in the rest pose.  When the pose changes, the vertices are calculated by a linear equation.  SSD is simple and fast, but suffers from artefacts.  Pose space deformation (PSD) is the most common method for correcting deformation artefacts.  In PSD, corrective displacements are manually added to the vertices for a set of example poses.  For a general pose, the PSD displacements are interpolated between the example poses.  This work aims to modify PSD so that it can be applied as a unified preprocessing step to SSD and also to any other skinning algorithm.  This work proposes a modification of PSD called "inverse PSD" in which the manually-corrected examples are first deformed back to the rest pose.  Then for a general pose, the PSD interpolation is performed in the space of the rest pose, before applying standard SSD.  The transformation back to the rest pose requires the inverse of the SSD transform, with minor modifications to avoid singularites.  For skinning algorithms other than SSD, an inverse transform might not be available, in which case the inverse transform is replaced by an optimization algorithm.  Powell's method is used because it does not require the gradient.  Inverse PSD was found to model joint rotation better than standard PSD.  Inverse PSD incurs more computational cost at the set-up stage, but not at run-time.
