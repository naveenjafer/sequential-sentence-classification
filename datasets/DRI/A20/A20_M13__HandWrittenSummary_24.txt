This paper construct a physically valid statistical model that leverages both physical constraints and statistical motion priors and utilize it to generate physically realistic human motion that achieves the goals specified by the user. The key idea of the motion modeling process is to learn nonlinear probabilistic force field functions from prerecorded motion data with Gaussian Process (GP) models, which maps the kinematic states to the generalized forces. The map is constructed by applying Principal Component Analysis techniques to reduce the dimensionality of both kinematic data and generalized force data and employ Gaussian process to model the force fields in reduced subspaces. The probability framework is then divided into three components: the first componentrepresents the probabilistic density function of the initial kinematic pose and velocity; the second component represents the force field priors; the third term pr physics measures how well the generated motion satisfies the physical constraints. After users specify the constraints, the motion synthesis problem formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) framework and is solved by an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm. The incorporation of physical constraints into statistical motion models ensures generalized motions are physically plausible, thereby removing noticeable visual artifacts. One of the limitation is the scalability, because Gaussian process needs to retain all of the training data to make predictions and therefore its computational demands grow as the square and cube respectively of the number of training examples. Also, the initialization process is critical to the success of our optimization.
