This paper aims to produce fluid simulations with a high degree of spatial adaptivity.Concretely, the contributions of our work are: • a novel tetrahedral discretization of the pressure projection step that is efficient to solve and robust to poor-quality elements; • an accurate treatment of second-order boundary conditions within the tetrahedral mesh; • a new technique for extracting a smooth surface from particles with varying radii; • and the inclusion of a flexible sizing function to focus computational resources on important areas of the flow with minimal overhead.We have presented a novel framework for highly adaptive liquid simulation. In our method, a novel, robust discretization works together with accurate embedded boundary conditions and a flexible sizing function to allow for aggressive adaptivity and high computational performance.In this way, we can efficiently compute tough simulation setups, such as large surfaces with very localized details. We have additionally presented a novel surface creation method that yields smooth surfaces in the presence of strongly varying particle radii, which turned out to be an important building block for our framework. We chose a BCC mesh generation because it is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest way to generate high-quality meshes. However, despite its efficiency, mesh generation is still a bottleneck for our simulation. So, instead of computing the mesh from scratch each time, we are interested in exploring techniques for continuous re-meshing.
