This paper shows that with careful placement of pressure samples, its Voronoi mesh-based fluid solver makes it possible for explicit surface tracking to achieve its full potential in capturing small scale liquid features. In addition, adapted embedded boundary pressure projection techniques to Voronoi meshes, introduced a simple improvement to barycentric velocity interpolation for Voronoi/Delaunay meshes, and extended the ghost fluid surface tension model with mesh-based curvature in order to capture complex capillary waves with minimal damping. The key contribution of this work is coupling an explicit surface tracker to a Voronoi-based liquid simulator with: • a pressure sample placement strategy that captures the complete liquid surface geometry, • an accurate surface tension model combining mesh-based curvature estimates and ghost fluid boundary conditions, • embedded free surface and solid boundary conditions adapted to Voronoi cells, avoiding the need for more onerous conforming tetrahedral mesh generation, • and a new velocity interpolant over unstructured meshes.
