This paper describes a technique for animating the behavior of viscoelastic fluids, such as mucus, liquid soap, pudding, toothpaste, or clay, that exhibit a combination of both fluid and solid characteristics. The technique builds upon prior Eulerian methods for animating incompressible fluids with free surfaces by including additional elastic terms in the basic Navier-Stokes equations. The elastic terms are computed by integrating and advecting strain-rate throughout the fluid. Transition from elastic resistance to viscous flow is controlled by von Misesâ€™s yield condition, and subsequent behavior is then governed by a quasi-linear plasticity model. This method for incorporating elastoplastic terms does not depend on the underlying fluid simulation method, and  it could be easily adapt to other fluid simulation techniques such as smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. Adding the elastoplastic terms would be fairly easy once a working fluid simulation exists. While the method presented can model a wide range of phenomena, many real materials can demonstrate behaviors not captured by this model. Biological fluids, such as blood, can exhibit many interesting effects that arise from their microscopic structure. Even relatively simple polymer suspensions can demonstrate behavior that can only be roughly captured with this model.
