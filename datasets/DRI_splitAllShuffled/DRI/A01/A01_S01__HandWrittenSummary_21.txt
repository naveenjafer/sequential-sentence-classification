With the help of modelling tools or capture devices, complicated 3D character models are widely used in fields of entertainment, virtual reality, medicine etc. 
The author's goal was to "incorporate example based skinning into a system having a variety of other skinning and deformation operations, and to be able to invert these operations regardless of their nature".  
SSD is  said to be the "most representative in the family of basic skinning".  The papers discussed how it performed in the inverse operation of PSD scheme.  For a simplified condition where only one joint rotation and two example poses are considered, we demonstrate this inverse strategy has a better performance than the same framework without it.  For a simplified condition where only one joint rotation and two example poses are considered, the inverse strategy is demonstrated.  It has a better performance than the same framework without it.
Due to its simplicity and efficiency, SSD is widely applied to interactive applications such as games and virtual reality, and it is implemented in most commercial animation packages.
The final animation can be synthesized by linearly blending RBF functions with the solved weights.  
The author's framework implements existing PSD theory and the distinction is that we insert an optimization module into the PSD pipeline by applying a unified inverse approach assuming the knowledge of basic skinning is unavailable.
The author implements this unified example-based approach as a Maya plugin.  In doing this it inter operates with their closed-source “Smooth Skinning” deformation.
