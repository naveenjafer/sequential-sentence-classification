Method	To probe the defects we used thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL).
Observation	The dose dependence of the subband intensity is shown in the insert of Fig. 1.
Background	These defects are created in different classes of wide-gap insulators12 and even in narrow-gap materials.13
Model	The model of defect creation by the “ground state” mechanism is not as straightforward as it may seem at first sight.
Background	The exciton self-trapping caused by exciton–phonon interaction was found in all rare-gas solids and reported in a number of books, reviews and papers.12,14,15,31–35
Background	The recent theoretical studies39,40 showed that in the fcc lattice of rare-gas solids the weak coupling between close-packed atomic rows and the crystal matrix may give rise to an interstitial atom of a specific configuration—a smeared clump called a crowdion.
Experiment	The dose was increased with exposure time.
Result	Electronic excitation is shown to affect the structural properties of the Xe matrix at low temperatures.
Observation	In view of the low TSL intensity the spectrum was collected over the heating time.
Background	The interpretation was supported by the recent experiments on selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.24
Observation	The shape of the M band in the luminescence spectrum of solid Xe measured at different excitation energies—below the bottom of the lowest exciton band n = 1 Γ(3/2) and in the range of the exciton absorption—is shown in Fig. 2 where the difference in the position and halfwidth FWHM of the M band is clearly seen.
Experiment	The experiments were performed at the Laboratory of Condensed System Spectroscopy at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics & Engineering NASU.
Experiment	The luminescence analysis was performed with Δλ = 2 nm by using a 0.5 m high-flux Pouey VUV monochromator equipped with a multisphere plate detector.
Background	A special type of lattice defects is an electronically induced point defect–Frenkel pair.
Background	This peculiarity in conjunction with the strong electron–phonon interaction followed by the self-trapping of excitons and holes12,14,15 results in a high quantum yield for the electronically induced processes, making the rare-gas matrices excellent objects for studying the topic under consideration.
Conclusion	The results obtained provided solid evidence of the “defect” nature of the M1 subband and the intrinsic nature of the M2 subband—emission of the true M-STE center in the regular lattice.
Experiment	On completion of the irradiation the spectrum of the TSL was recorded.
Conclusion	The existence of two subbands of molecular luminescence was verified—a defect related component and component originated from the exciton self-trapping in the regular lattice.
Experiment	After the sample preparation and cooling, the cell was removed and the free-standing cryocrystal of 1 mm thickness was studied.
Model	The relevant relaxation processes involving the self-trapping of holes and excitons can be given by the reactions:RgH+ + Rg → Rg2+ + ΔE+(STH) → Rg2++ e → Rg* + Rg + ΔE(DRec)RgE* + Rg → Rg2* + ΔE*(M-STE) → hν (M-STE) + Rg + Rg + ΔE(D)We take RgH+ and RgE* to denote a free hole and free exciton, respectively.
Conclusion	Free excitons can be then self-trapped in the regular lattice or trapped in some defect site.
Result	The careful check of the spatial distribution of the centers emitting M1 and M2 subbands, performed with the electron beam of different energy, and hence, of different penetration depth, demonstrated the bulk origin of both centers.24
Conclusion	First of all, the origin of the M1 and M2 subbands was verified using the advantages of the selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.
Method	However, the direct proof of the excitonic mechanism requires experiments with state-selective excitation.
Observation	The intensity of the M2 subband related to the exciton self-trapped in the regular lattice remains constant.
Result	During the next 100 min we observed a saturation of the dose dependence of the M1 intensity followed by a slow decrease with long irradiation time.
Method	The synchrotron radiation providing an intense VUV light tunable through the range of excitonic absorption of rare-gas solids is best suited to such an experiment.
Model	In the case of exciton self-trapping by reaction (2) the relaxation energy is transferred to the surrounding atoms at both stages—in the excited state of the M-STE and in the ground state.
Experiment	To restore the excitation spectra we used the following procedure:24 a series of luminescence spectra were recorded with a successive increase of the excitation energy, then the luminescence spectra recorded were resolved into the M1 and the M2 components and the intensities of each subband were plotted as a function of the excitation energy.
Model	The energy needed for the reorientation can be released in the lattice in the course of the vibronic relaxation.
Background	The comprehensive study performed in pure and doped Kr matrices28 permitted us to suggest mechanisms of defect creation via exciton self-trapping into molecular states.
Experiment	The following decomposition of the M band into M1 and M2 subbands yielded the dose dependence of the defect component and the regular one.
Observation	The recorded TSL spectrum is shown in Fig. 6.
Model	This stage followed by the M-STE formation in the on-center position is shown in Fig. 5 (a and b).
Experiment	The samples were grown in a closed cell with an electromagnetic shutter mounted on a L-He cryostat holder in the vacuum chamber.
Object	We performed the experiment with detection of a thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) spectrum of the samples irradiated by VUV photons.
Background	Physics and chemistry in cryomatrices is an active research field and rare-gas matrices have been used frequently in studies over many years.1–7
Model	Note that STH and M-STE might be considered as “matrix isolated” molecular centers within its own host crystal.
Model	Investigation of electronically induced lattice rearrangement requires definite experimental conditions—first, high quality samples with low concentration of initial defects and impurities, then subthreshold excitation of the samples using slow particles of energy deficient to produce defects via knock-on mechanism or photons of appropriate energy, and finally, excitation of the samples at low temperatures to exclude the conventional thermally-activated defect creation.
Model	In accordance with this consideration, the mechanisms of exciton-induced defect creation can be classified as an “excited state” mechanism and a “ground state” one.28
Method	Even in our first studies23,25 slow electrons were used for the excitation in order to prevent the knock-on defect creation—formation of defects by elastic collisions.
Background	The rare-gas solids are characterized by extremely small binding energies in comparison with the energies of electronic excitations.
Background	Another interesting example to mention is the influence of local matrix morphology on the formation of neutral ground-state chemical compounds involving rare-gas atoms.11
Result	The distinct enhancement of the defect subband M1 upon irradiation indicates an increase in the number of defect sites, i.e. accumulation of permanent lattice defects.
Result	These changes are caused by the intensity redistribution between the two components of its internal structure—M1 and M2.
Experiment	After the sample preparation and its cooling, the shutter was open providing the free access for the electron beam and emerging luminescence.
Conclusion	Analysis of the intensity redistribution upon exposure to the VUV light in the range of the exciton absorption enabled us to gain clear evidence for the permanent lattice defect creation via exciton self-trapping into the molecular state.
Experiment	We used electrons of 1 keV energy, deficient to create defects by knock-on collisions.
Background	To cite an example, the stabilization effect of structural defects on the intrinsic ionic species Rg2+, so-called self-trapped holes (STH), in cryomatrices was recently found in the experiments carried out at Bondybey’s Laboratory.9,10
Result	However, because of the strong overlapping of the two subbands the direct measurement of the separate excitation spectra of the M1 and M2 subbands is impossible.
Object	The influence of the annealing at 60 K on the intensity distribution in the M band was examined.
Background	The spectroscopic investigation of lattice defect creation in the case of exciton self-trapping into molecular states, as occurred in solid Xe, Kr and Ar, is a rigorous task.
Observation	The excitation above the Γ(3/2) exciton band bottom resulted in the appearance of two subbands with the predominance of a M2 subband at 7.22 eV.
Model	The contribution of the initial defects can be easily found by extrapolating the dose dependence of the M1 subband intensity to zero.
Experiment	The electron-hole pairs were generated by a short-term exposure to the VUV radiation.
Method	These high-resolution spectral studies revealed a creation and accumulation of point defects in the Ne lattice under irradiation by slow electrons.
Experiment	The irradiation and measurements were performed at low temperature (15 K) in order to exclude the conventional thermal mechanism of defect creation and to avoid the annealing of the defects produced.
Object	The experimental findings are compared with the results obtained under electron beam irradiation, and discussed in relation to the suggested model of defect creation.
Background	It has been shown that the M band in all rare-gas solids consists of two components—M1 (related to the molecular centers in the defect sites) and M2 (related to the molecular centers formed in the regular lattice at the exciton self-trapping).
Model	After the radiative transition (hν (M-STE)) of the relaxed M-STE to a repulsive part of the ground state potential, the excess energy ΔE(D) = 0.86 eV is shared between two dimer atoms, in other words, there appear the two “hot” atoms with a 0.43 eV kinetic energy available for the defect creation.
Experiment	The samples were then subjected to prolonged irradiation by the VUV light.
Background	In contrast to the case of exciton self-trapping into atomic states the luminescence spectra of molecular self-trapped excitons (M-STE) have a shape of broad bands stemming from the electronic transition from the 1,3Σ+u to a repulsive part of the ground state 1Σ+g (the well-known M bands.12,14,15)
Conclusion	The excitation energy is transferred to the defects by free excitons followed by their trapping and radiative decay yielding the M1 subband.
Observation	The solid line represents the total yield of the luminescence in the M band as a function of the excitation energy.
Hypothesis	If the hole is trapped in a defect site one can expect the appearance of the M1 subband in the TSL spectrum.
Background	The existence of these two components in the M bands provides a way for application of the sensitive VUV luminescence spectroscopy method to characterize the samples and to study the electronically induced defect creation.
Background	The accumulation of radiation-induced defects was detected in all heavy rare-gas solids—Ar, Kr and Xe.23,25–27
Model	If a part of the electrons is trapped in some defect sites, STHs remain stable in the lattice at temperatures low enough to prohibit the release of the electrons from their traps.
Experiment	The primary monochromator was tuned to the energy of the n = 2 Γ(3/2) band in the absorption spectrum of solid Xe.
Background	Whereas in the case of “matrix-site” effect the defects adversely affect guest optical spectra causing a band broadening, the presence of defects, which can be seen as charge traps, is favourable for stabilization of ionic species in cryomatrices.
Background	The self-trapping of excitons into atomic states is suggested to be a stimulating factor.
Experiment	The selective excitation was carried out with a bandpass of Δλ = 0.25 nm.
Model	The efficiency of this defect creation channel via recombination depends on the rate of electron thermalization and is not expected to be high.
Model	However, there are no stable interstitials of the “dumb-bell” configuration aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic direction.37
Object	Creation of permanent lattice defects via exciton self-trapping into molecular states in Xe matrix
Model	It seems to be the case for the M-STE relaxation which offers the basis for the development of the “excited state” mechanism.
Result	The existence of the two subbands points to a branching of the relaxation channels.
Model	As was already mentioned, two efficient channels of electronic excitation self-trapping exist in the lattice of heavy rare-gas solids–formation of STEs and STHs.
Experiment	The position and FWHM of the M1 and M2 subbands were obtained from the numerical fit of the band shape assuming a Gaussian shape of the subbands.
Object	The internal structure and the intensity distribution were analyzed.
Model	The first stage of these reactions corresponds to the self-trapping of holes (1) and excitons (2) followed by the formation of vibronically hot charged (STH) and neutral (M-STE) dimers.
Experiment	The samples were condensed from the vapour phase at elevated temperature under isobaric conditions (P = 1000 Pa) with a constant cooling in the temperature range 125–110 K. Then the temperature was controllably reduced at a constant rate of 0.1 Ks−1.
Object	Let us take up possible channels of electronically induced defect creation keeping in mind that the key point for this process is the relaxation energy release in a confined region of the crystal.
Background	The part of the defects in the accumulation of matrix-isolated species has already been discussed in earlier studies1,8 and the well-known “matrix-site” effect often involves lattice imperfections.
Experiment	The irradiation was performed under steady state conditions with a current density of 50 μA cm−2.
Object	In order to shed more light on the origin of the internal structure of the M band, we restored the excitation spectra of the M1 and M2 subbands.
Background	The computational results were presented for Ar and Kr cryoscrystals and it was mentioned that the formation of crowdions is also expected in the Xe lattice.
Experiment	The entire M band was periodically recorded during exposure.
Observation	Fig. 1 demonstrates the internal structure of the M band in solid Xe and its temporal evolution under excitation by slow electrons.
Observation	The shape of the M band profoundly varies with exposure time.
Motivation	Defects of structure are of substantial importance in the kinetics of solid-state chemical reactions and have a pronounced effect on the efficiency of formation and stability of radicals and ionic species in cryogenic solids.
Result	With increasing the concentration of the radiation-induced Frenkel pairs (interstitials and vacancies) the contribution of the defect annihilation processes (second and third terms of the equation) increases.
Conclusion	Because of low intensity, reliable decomposition of the M band in the TSL spectrum is impossible.
Result	A direct evidence for the creation and accumulation of point lattice defects in solid Xe via the excitonic mechanism was obtained for the first time.
Conclusion	The model of permanent lattice defect creation and transformation is discussed.
Conclusion	Bearing this in mind, one can assume that the short-lived defect of the off-center configuration can be stabilized by the reorientation of the dimer axis to the 〈100〉 direction (d in Fig. 5).
Experiment	The set-up designed for luminescence experiments in the VUV range is given elsewhere,29 so only essential details are mentioned here.
Background	Note that the TSL from solid Xe grown at low temperature yielded a 7.6 eV band.42
Result	The comparison with the luminescence spectrum excited by photons of 8.86 eV energy (in the band of intrinsic exciton absorption of solid Xe) shows that the TSL band consists of two components M1 and M2.
Object	This paper reports the results of a synchrotron radiation study into permanent lattice defect creation in the Xe matrix via excitonic mechanism.
Model	It was shown37 that the split 〈100〉 “dumb-bell” form is the only stable form of the interstitial atom in the Xe lattice.
Background	Despite the aforementioned attractive properties of the rare-gas solids the experimental study into electronically induced defect creation was undertaken not so long ago.
Model	The Frank–Condon transition of this dimer to the ground state will correspond to the transition of the molecular center to the permanent defect level with almost no change in the interatomic distance.
Object	The temporal evolution of the intensity distribution in the band of molecular type self-trapped exciton luminescence was analyzed.
Experiment	The sequence of luminescence spectra was recorded using a normal incidence 1 m VUV monochromator with a bandpass of Δλ = 0.16 nm.
Experiment	The samples of required quality were grown in a special closed cell mounted on a He-flow cryostat holder in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment (10−10 mbr).
Background	The difference in energies is of the order of 102–103.
Background	The results obtained in combination with the activation spectroscopy study19,20 supported the theoretical model21,22 of the evolution of atomic self-trapped excitons (A-STE) into permanent lattice defects—Frenkel pairs of the second neighbour configuration.
Result	The earlier data on the excitation spectra obtained by the “red–blue-side” separation method31 supported the assignment of the M2 subband as originated from the M-STE in the regular lattice whereas the M1 subband was assigned to the exciton of molecular configuration trapped in the defect site.
Object	The lattice defect creation was studied using the selective vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy methods.
Result	Apparently, both kinds of defects—the initial structural defects and the defects created via electronic excitation—contribute to the M1 subband.
Model	The center formed resembles a “dumb-bell” configuration of the interstitial atom.
Object	A sequence of spectra were measured upon exposure to the VUV light.
Result	Ionizing radiation (electrons in our case) creates primary excitations—free electron-hole pairs.
Background	The recent study suggested this band to be originated from trimer Xe3*43.
Model	The self-trapping occurring during the lifetime of the excited state results in the formation of a molecular dimer aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic directions with an interatomic distance of 0.31 nm.35
Model	At both relaxation stages an essential amount of energy ΔE+(STH) and ΔE(DRec) is released in the vicinity of STH, which can be spent on the lattice defect creation.
Experiment	The study to be described was performed at the SUPERLUMI station of the Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor HASYLAB at DESY.
Model	The dose dependence of radiation-induced point defect (e.g. vacancies) concentration Cv is described by the following equation∂Cv/∂t = Kdc − Kr (CiCv) − Ci0Cv0) − Kt (Cv − Cv0)Here Kdc is the coefficient that characterizes the rate of permanent defect creation via exciton self-trapping, whereas Kr and Kt are the coefficients of the vacancy-interstitial recombination and trapping by some kind of sinks, respectively.
Background	TSL of solid Xe at the photon energy 7.2 eV after irradiation by X-rays was observed in ref. 41 but the M1 and M2 subbands in the TSL band were not discriminated.
Method	We used a combination of the luminescence analysis, excitation spectroscopy, and thermally stimulated luminescence.
Experiment	High-purity Xe gas (99.9996%) was used, and the gas handling system was operated under UHV conditions.
Observation	Note that the exposure time is not corrected for the synchrotron radiation pulse duration, so it is in fact a real time of the measurements.
Conclusion	Three channels of “indirect” exciton creation were found under selective excitation above the band gap energy Eg: (i) recombination of electron-hole pairs, (ii) inelastic scattering of electrons, and (iii) excitonic side bands of valence or inner-shell excitation.30
Model	The matter is that during self-trapping Rg atoms are brought closer together displacing along the 〈110〉 direction, as shown in Fig. 5b.
Method	The design of a special cryogenic cell23 for sample growth enabled us to grow samples of high crystal quality and to reveal the internal structure of the M bands.
Model	The secondary electrons produced under excitation well above Eg for the most part remain in the solid, and hence each hole has, in the mean, its counterpart—an electron elsewhere.
Experiment	For comparison, we replicated the experiments with excitation by an electron beam following the identical procedure of the sample growing.
Observation	Each of the subbands approximated by the Gaussian is depicted in Fig. 1.
Method	The samples were excited by synchrotron radiation in the range of excitonic absorption.
Observation	The resulting excitation spectra are shown in Fig. 3.
Result	Note that at low temperatures the thermally activated diffusion of vacancies to sinks is negligible and only the radiation-induced defect motion comes to play.
Observation	The intensity of the M2 subband associated with the M-STE in the regular lattice remained constant during exposure to the VUV light.
Background	The direct experimental proof of this mechanism of defect creation was provided by a recent study carried out with synchrotron radiation.18
Method	The first efforts were concentrated on defect creation via self-trapping of excitons into atomic states that is the case for solid Ne.16,17
Result	At low temperatures and small doses, the reactions of recombination and trapping are extremely slow, and we observe a linear increase of the M1 subband intensity indicating the accumulation of defects in the sample.
Background	The basis for the physics of electronically induced lattice rearrangement is a concentration of the excitation energy released in the relaxation process within a volume about that of a unit cell followed by the energy transfer to the surrounding matrix.
Conclusion	However, the contribution of both subbands can be ascertained.
Background	The vacancy also becomes delocalized, forming a smeared sparsed region (anticrowdion).
Result	The procedure applied enabled us to estimate the low energy excitation thresholds E1 and E2 for the M1 and M2 subbands, respectively: E1 = 8.18 eV, E2 = 8.28 eV.
Model	The energy release during the M-STE vibronic cooling ΔE*(M-STE) is about 0.45 eV 36 which is higher than the binding energy per atom in solid Xe (172.3 meV .12)
Goal	In order to distinguish clearly the recombination (1) and excitonic (2) channels of defect creation the direct experiments with selective excitation into the exciton band were performed.
Observation	The excitation below the exciton band gave rise to a defect M1 subband with a maximum at 7.05 eV.
Object	Let us discuss some possible models of exciton-induced defect creation via self-trapping into molecular states—M-STE.
Result	The separation between the “dumb-bell” atoms is found to be 0.86d (d is the distance between the nearest neighbours), which only slightly exceeds the interatomic distance between the atoms in the Xe2* dimer (0.31 nm).
Goal	Based on this assignment we measured the dose dependence of the M1 and M2 subbands to probe the defect creation upon excitation in the exciton band.
Object	The electronically induced lattice rearrangement of solid Xe was studied by the VUV spectroscopy methods under selective excitation with synchrotron radiation.
Experiment	The excitation energy was chosen in the range of the n = 2 term of the Γ(3/2) excitonic series.
Model	Taking into account the fact that the electrons are characterized by free-like behavior12 in rare-gas solids, in other words, they are highly mobile, one can expect an efficient recombination on the electron thermalization.
Observation	At the first stage of VUV irradiation (up to 100 min) we observed a pronounced enhancement of the M1 subband intensity.
Result	The recombination of STHs with electrons gives rise to the self-trapped excitons emitting the M2 subband.
Observation	The result of this treatment—the corresponding points of the curves—yields the dose dependence of the subband intensity shown in Fig. 4.
Result	The intense luminescence of free excitons indicated their high quality.
Conclusion	The method of lattice defect detection developed in our studies16,17,23 is in fact a modification of the sensitized luminescence method.
Model	As the theory shows,38 in a system with a strong local vibration the energy release proceeds in a jump-like multiphonon process.
Model	Its displacement along the 〈110〉 direction to an off-center configuration (position c in Fig. 5) cannot stabilize the center.
Conclusion	One can suggest that on long-term exposure there occurs an aggregation of defects.
Conclusion	The details of the defect transformation on long-term irradiation invite further investigation.
Observation	The polycrystalline samples thus produced were optically transparent.
Model	While relaxing through the vibronic levels, the positively charged dimer STH can recombine with a thermalized electron into a repulsive electronic state yielding two Rg atoms separated energetically (a so called dissociative recombination DRec).
Result	Due to the low absorption coefficient the exciting light penetrated deep inside the sample, and the M-STE dimers were efficiently formed in the bulk.

Hypothesis	One might envisage in these borate glasses, for example, the participation of a bond-switching mechanism where there are negatively charged [BO4]− groups embedded in a framework of [BO3] triangles, to generate neigbouring [BO3]− triangles containing one nonbridging oxygen (nBO):
Result	This process of chemical isomerisation clearly leads to a localised weakening of the network, and could occur simultaneously (and synergetically) with the arrival of a new cation.
Model	For our investigations we have chosen a mixed Li/Na borate glass system, which shows a conventional mixed alkali effect, which intensifies with decreasing temperature and moreover has been thoroughly characterized with respect to its structure and dynamics using broadband conductivity spectroscopy25–27 and NMR spectroscopy.28–30
Result	The original hop will then prove ‘unsuccessful’ in the sense used by Funke and coworkers.32,33
Background	The mixed alkali effect (MAE) remains one of the unsolved mysteries of glass science.
Observation	Fig. 2 shows the dc conductivity of glassy 0.3[x Li2O·(1 − x) Na2O]·0.7 B2O3 at 373 K and features a pronounced minimum at x = 0.4.
Goal	With this methodology, we are able now to compare the free-volume properties of single and mixed-cation glasses.
Background	Analysis of this temperature dependence requires careful consideration.
Result	Ion hopping depends on the space being available locally, so cavities of the right size are needed for this reaction to occur.
Method	The shortest lifetime (100 to 200 ps) is attributed to the self-annihilation of a positron bound to an electron of opposite spin, i.e. para-positronium (p-Ps).
Background	It is especially unclear how far the network participates in the ion transport mechanism.
Background	However, the concentrations of such nBOs arising from the computer simulations is somewhat higher than that found by NMR.23–25
Conclusion	Thus we are able to establish for the first time a link between activation volume anomalies in mixed cation glasses,13–15 the changes in cavity distribution reported here, and the ‘thermodynamic’ anomalies in mixed cation glasses (see Fig. 2).
Model	PALS spectra are composed of contributions from each annihilation event: these can be extracted by a non-linear least-squares fit of a weighted sum of exponentials:Here, τi denotes the mean lifetime of the positron state i, and Ii is the relative intensity of the lifetime component and n is the number of positron states.
Object	Free volume anomalies in mixed-cation glasses revealed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS)
Method	An obvious technique to use is positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), which is widely used, for example, to explore cavity sizes in zeolites16 and ‘free volume’ in glassy polymers,17 and to understand ion transport in polymer electrolytes.18,19
Experiment	The melt was poured into a rectangular graphite mould and held inside the furnace for another 10 min.
Experiment	Temperature was controlled by a single variable voltage power supply attached to both heaters.
Conclusion	It may also provide the means of reconciling differing viewpoints concerning the numbers of nBOs in borate glasses (compare refs. 28–30 with ref. 35).
Background	VA is identified13–15 with the volume required to open up this second site.
Background	This divergence of opinion highlights the limitations to our current understanding of processes occurring in glass.
Experiment	Two slices of more than 1 mm thickness were cut from the raw glasses.
Background	In other words, there are additional thermal history effects.
Background	However, there are divergent views5 as to whether ‘mismatch-opposed’ processes ever actually occur in glass, and whether such ion hops can trigger inter-site conversion processes below Tg.
Background	It involves a wide range of phenomena, including deep minima in ionic conductivities, crossovers in diffusion coefficient, additional (and large) internal friction peaks, and minima in glass transition temperatures, Tg.1–3
Background	While there is indirect evidence that site conversions do occur below Tg,6,7 other authors have argued 8–10 that cations in mixed glasses simply avoid the ‘inappropriate’ sites and that the distribution of cation sites remains as it was frozen in at Tg.
Result	Although we cannot quantify the absolute number of voids existing in single and mixed cation glasses, we will argue that the increased network disturbance also leads to the observed decreases in Tg displayed in Fig. 2.
Result	For this reaction to proceed, all that is needed is for an electron pair from one of the four B–O bonds in the [BO4]− group to be transferred entirely to the O atom it shares with the neighbouring [BO3] group, and for the structure to relax slightly.
Experiment	Alkali borate glasses of composition 0.3[x Li2O·(1−x) Na2O]·0.7 B2O3 (with x = 0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0) were prepared from dry mixtures of stoichiometric amounts of reagent grade powder chemicals Na2CO3, Li2CO3 and B2O3 which were heated in a platinum crucible at 1273 K for about 3 h.
Experiment	PALS measurements have been performed using an automated EG&G Ortec fast–fast coincidence system.
Model	The volume of the sphere may then be calculated from R.
Background	Bunde et al4,5. have described a ‘dynamic structure model’ that draws attention to the role played by cations in building their own sites, or ‘digging their own holes’, in the glass structure.
Result	The reaction above shows how ion hopping might be related to localised relaxation of the network.
Model	If the radius of the well is R (assuming a sphere), the o-Ps pickoff lifetime is usually related to the radius of the cavity by:23,24where τo-Ps denotes the o-Ps pickoff lifetime.
Observation	No source correction was used.
Observation	Further heating of the sample to 473 K leads to a new and much simpler pattern of behaviour with a single maximum in positronium intensity and a corresponding minimum in positronium lifetimes.
Background	These relaxations might be expected to influence the distribution of free volume in mixed cation glasses, and so may well influence the PALS data collected at these (lower) temperatures.
Conclusion	Clearly, more extended studies are required to establish links between ion transport processes and PALS data, especially if all the additional information can be extracted from the complex temperature dependences reported above.
Conclusion	To this extent at least, the present results lend positive support to the general approach described in the dynamic structure model of glass.4,5
Observation	The ripple, moreover, is clearly evident at 373 K. It takes the form of a maximum in Io-Ps on the Li-rich side and a corresponding minimum in τo-Ps, and a maximum in τo-Ps and a corresponding minimum in Io-Ps on the Na-rich side.
Observation	The minimum in the DC conductivity coincides with the minimum of the glass transition temperature (see Fig. 2).
Method	When a positron enters a material three separate processes may occur, each with a different lifetime.20,21
Method	Data were collected at several temperatures and analysed using the PFPOSFIT program.
Result	The resulting increased disturbance in the network results in an increased number of cavities, as is indeed indicated by the observed maximum in the Io-Ps data (see Fig. 5).
Model	The lifetime of o-Ps in a vacuum is 142 ns.
Result	However, a second mechanism may come into play in mixed cation glasses, especially at higher temperatures (like 473 K).
Background	We base our interpretation of this ‘high temperature’ data on the recent discussions of trends in activation volume.13–15
Conclusion	However, we might now postulate that even if these nBOs are produced only transiently in ‘real’ alkali borate glasses, they may still play a vital role in the opening up of sites – either to allow cations to escape from their existing sites or to enter new ones.
Model	The intensity of the o-Ps component is related to the o-Ps formation probability and reflects the concentration of cavities accessible to o-Ps.
Result	Thus, if a Na+ ion moves forward into a new site, it will leave behind an open Na-site, which will then immediately be reoccupied by a second Na+ ion.
Motivation	What would clearly be helpful is independent evidence concerning the available volume and how it is distributed in both single and mixed-cation glasses.
Result	Thus, in single cation glasses (Li or Na), we suggest that each ion migrates along clearly defined pathways where Li+ ions hop into empty Li-sites, and Na+ ions hop into empty Na-sites.
Background	The mismatch-opposed hops would be slower than the hopping of Li+ ions into Li sites, which is the dominant process in single-cation Li+ ion conducting glasses.
Model	The 1/2 pre-factor is the inverse of the spin averaged Ps annihilation lifetime and ΔR has been found empirically to equal 0.166 nm.24
Method	The third lifetime (600 ps upwards) arises from the annihilation of the semi-stable species ortho-positronium (o-Ps), which is a positron paired with an electron with spins in parallel.
Observation	The sizes of the cavities for 473 K (see Fig. 4) are somewhat larger (ca. 6 cm3 mol−1) than those of the mobile cations (ca. 1.5 cm3 mol−1 for Li+, and 3.5 cm3 mol−1 for Na+, based on recent activation volume data13–15).
Background	This result suggests that network relaxation can have only little influence on ion transport.
Method	Error bars in the experimental data were determined from repeated experiments on the same sample.
Background	As the recent NMR results by Ratai et al28–30. show, these mixed alkali effects cannot be explained by ‘normal’ structural peculiarities.
Observation	However, they are clearly smaller than the [BO3] and [BO4]− units that constitute the network (between 15 and 20 cm3 mol−1, respectively, based on the numbers of O2− ions present).
Result	The first component is attributed to self-annihilation (p-Ps) and free positrons, and is not considered further.
Observation	Apparently, in all mixed-cation glasses of type 0.3[x Li2O·(1 − x) Na2O]·0.7 B2O3, the ratio N4 = [BO4]−/([BO3] + [BO4]−) remains the same.
Experiment	Then the samples were removed from the mould, immediately annealed at 20 K below their respective glass transition temperatures for 3 h and then cooled to ambient temperature at a rate of 0.5 K min−1.
Result	In mixed cation glasses, the ‘wrong’ cation—in this case it could be a Li+ ion—would fail to complete the second step in time, since it is forestalled by Na+ ion (1) moving more readily back into its starting site.
Model	In condensed matter, lifetimes are shortened to a few ns since the annihilation rate depends on the probability of the overlap of the o-Ps wavefunction with the wavefunctions of the surrounding electrons, which is dependent on the cavity size.
Background	One must take into account, for example, the well-known ‘thermometer’ effect,1–3 which involves volume inelasticities in mixed alkali glasses that are observed far below Tg.
Background	On the other hand, Ingram et al13–15. have argued from the evidence of variable-pressure variable-temperature (VPVT) measurements that activation volumes, VA, for ion transport are conveniently interpreted in terms of the ‘opening up’ of empty cation sites, a process which obviously does involve the glassy network to some extent (see Fig. 1).
Background	Thus, Angell11,12 pointed out many years ago that for common inorganic glasses (phosphates, borates, silicates, etc.), the ratio, Rτ of the times required for structural relaxation to occur at Tg (as indicated by the step function in heat capacity in a DSC experiment) to the average residence time of the ions (as indicated by the electric field relaxation time from impedance spectroscopy) is very large, with values of Rτ falling in the range 1011 to 1014.
Background	A mismatch arises when one type of cation, e.g. Li+, tries to enter a site created earlier by another, e.g. Na+, and this is identified as the prime cause of the mixed alkali effect.
Experiment	The sample-source sandwich was placed between two mica-insulated heaters with a thermocouple placed close to the sample.
Background	These glasses thus depart even further from internal thermal equilibrium than do single-cation glasses.
Background	These delayed volume changes relate to different sites being occupied by mobile cations, and to the slowness (measured in days or weeks) of volume relaxations occurring in mixed cation glasses close to ambient temperature.
Result	However, the interaction between cations and network is now much stronger than in single cation glasses, since two new sites are being opened up in the cooperative process that facilitates ion transport.
Model	Self-annihilation (p-Ps) gives little information on cavity characteristics.
Background	MDI thanks the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for a Research Award.
Hypothesis	But how does such a process of site opening occur?
Method	A particular feature of the approach being advanced here is the proposal for localised relaxations involved in the ‘opening up’ of closed sites.5,13–15
Result	PALS experiments reveal a minimum in ortho-positronium (o-Ps) lifetimes and a maximum in the corresponding intensities that emerge when mixed-cation (Li/Na) borate glasses are heated from ambient temperatures up to 473 K. These free volume ‘anomalies’ appear to be a true manifestation of the mixed alkali effect (MAE).
Background	The authors would like to thank Prof. T. J. Bastow (CSIRO) for experimental assistance, and Dr Kate Nairn and Prof. H. Eckert for helpful discussions.
Result	This process may be represented schematically as:Na+(2) + Na+(1) + ‘new site’ ⇒ Na+(2) + ‘open site’ + Na+(1)Na+(2) + ‘open site’ ⇒ ‘open site’ + Na+(2)The essential idea is that the ‘success’ of the hop made by Na+ ion (1) will be facilitated by its original site being occupied by Na+ ion (2).
Observation	Furthermore, the tetrahedrally coordinated [BO4]−-groups and the trigonal planar coordinated [BO3]-groups as well as the cations are randomly distributed throughout the glass structure.
Method	The PALS experiment measures the lifetimes of positron species by detecting ‘start quanta’ of 1.28 MeV associated with their birth (from the decay of 22Na to 22Ne) and ‘stop quanta’ of 511 keV associated with their death (annihilation).
Result	The second component, with a lifetime ca. 800 ps is attributed to the lifetime of o-Ps localised in cavities, and is referred to as τo-Ps.
Conclusion	If this is indeed the process which makes use of free volume cavities in glass, then it provides a logical link between the presence of the cavities detected by PALS and the ion transport mechanism.
Result	This also has the effect of ‘pushing the Na+ ion forward’, and hence of securing the success of the first ion’s hop.
Background	The PALS experiments were carried out with funding from the Australian Research Council within the framework of the ARC Centres of Excellence program through the Centre for Nanostructured Electromaterials.
Observation	These error bars are much larger than those determined from the fitting procedure.
Model	When o-Ps annihilates, it is assumed to do so in a potential well where the o-Ps wavefunction has a given penetration depth, ΔR, into the material surrounding the potential well.
Method	The second lifetime (200 to 600 ps) is usually attributed to the annihilation of ‘free’ positrons or to those trapped in the material.
Background	It is noteworthy that a recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of lithium borate glasses34 points to the importance of nonbridging oxygens (nBOs) in creating sites in glass favourable to Li+ ion transport.
Background	Although significant progress has been made in recent years towards understanding some of the underlying chemical and physical principles, there is still disagreement concerning how far ion-hopping processes in either single or mixed cation glasses involve the cooperation of the glassy network.
Conclusion	They are consistent with a mechanism of ion transport involving cooperation between hops of unlike cations, resulting in increased disturbance of the glass network.
Result	This is represented schematically as:Li+ + Na+(1) + ‘new site’ ⇒ Li+ + ‘open site’ + Na+(1)Li+ + ‘second new site’ ⇒ ‘open site’ + Li+The additional feature is that the second ion, in this case it is the Li+ ion, has taken the opportunity to open up a new site of its own close to the site originally occupied by the Na+ ion.
Observation	At least two spectra of 30 000 peak counts were collected, with each spectrum taking approximately 3 h to collect.
Observation	Statistical analysis resulted in spectra best fitted with two exponentials.
Model	However, the metastable ortho-positronium atoms, localised in cavities, have average lifetimes that depend on the cavity size.
Result	At ambient temperature (298 K), there is no consistent dependence on composition in either the intensity, Io-Ps, or of the lifetime, τo-Ps, although there is some suggestion of a small ‘ripple’ in both quantities, see also .ref. 31
Experiment	Two identical samples (>1 mm thick) of glass were placed on either side of a source consisting of a 2 mm diameter 25 μCi spot sandwiched between two 2.54 μm titanium foils.
Background	Accordingly, we do not discuss further the low-temperature data, but focus instead on the pattern of behaviour observed at 473 K, which is some 200 K below Tg but high enough for the ‘thermometer effects’ to be avoided.
Observation	Figs. 3–5 show how the o-Ps lifetimes and corresponding intensities for the Li–Na borate glasses vary with composition at three temperatures: 298 K, 373 K, and 473 K, respectively.
Conclusion	The result lends support to the dynamic structure model.
Conclusion	It appears that the structural dynamics become increasingly important with increasing temperature.
Result	The size of the cavities points to a glass system that is fairly dense, but not as close-packed as the ‘more ionic’ fluoride glasses studied earlier by Hill et al.21
Background	This figure shows schematically how a mobile cation hops from a site close to its compensating negative charge (shown here as a non-bridging oxygen (nBO)) into an empty site provided by the network.

Background	In earlier work, the motion of labeled single lipids was visualized.
Model	In Fig. 1, a logarithmic plot of Brownian motion with an underlying diffusion coefficient of D = 1 μm2 s−1 and a varied positional error is displayed.
Conclusion	The lipid monolayer thickness is about 2 nm, which is very small compared to both the 2.0 × 102 nm and to the 2.8 × 103 nm used in our study studies and by Nassoy et al., respectively.
Conclusion	Clustering of proteins, assumed to occur in lipid rafts21 could be induced by such a mechanism.
Result	These effects of irregularities of the domain border are, as expected, more eminent at small domain sizes.
Experiment	Fluorescently labeled carboxylated polystyrene latexes mimicking negatively charged proteins (diameter 100 and 200 nm) were added to the subphase and were found to be localized at the air/water interface.
Method	Since the packing density of lipids within monolayers at the air/water interface can be changed easily, inhomogeneity with regard to the phase state can be achieved by isothermal compression to coexistence regions.
Background	Further details are given in the respective previously published manuscript.43
Result	These factors are not well characterized for the latex beads used for our study.
Method	Already published features of these experimental models are reported concisely in the following.
Method	Phase coexistence of liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed phases was generated by adjustment of the lateral pressure.
Object	Therefore, the electric field of domains with decreased size, resembling the size of lipid raft microdomains, was calculated by us.
Method	These measurements with long observation times, thus far only possible with this method, were combined with respective Monte-Carlo simulations.
Method	The potential depth (at the minimal distance, |r| = 50 nm for 100 nm diameter beads) used was varied in the range from 0 to 20 kBT. The diffusion coefficient in the long-time limit shows a sharp transition for D from 1 μm−2 s−1 to about 0 around a potential depth of U = 6.6kBT (cf. Fig. 6).
Method	In other words, ρ(r) is the amount of times a specific distance range [(r − Δr), (r + Δr)] from a condensed domain was visited during a track.
Background	In earlier experiments studying the interactions of colloids with lipid domains which were performed employing larger sulfonated polystyrene beads (2.8 μm diameter) and pentadecanoic acid on different subphases, the attractive potentials found could be completely explained by dipolar interactions.53
Background	Another potential parameter affecting the diffusive behavior was demonstrated to be the size of ordered domains.
Experiment	All chemicals were used without further purification.
Model	In each step of the simulation the particle is displaced by Δr with regard to the domain boundary.
Background	For instance, observation of diffusion in cell membranes demonstrated confined motion of membrane constituents and even subdiffusion.
Method	In this fashion, a random walk with a diffusion coefficient D is obtained.
Experiment	Up to 50 particles were tracked at once with an estimated spatial accuracy of 100 nm.30,43
Background	Disturbing interactions of diffusing proteins with other structures within the membrane, e.g. with the membrane-associated cytoskeleton or ordered lipid domains, are supposed to be the reasons for this behavior.7,14,15
Experiment	Holes in the lid were sealed against air flow, e.g. by a respective ring around the microscope objective and a dome over the Wilhelmy sensor system.
Experiment	Salts for the subphase buffer, sodium chloride, monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Steinheim, Germany and St Lois, MO, USA) and of analytical grade.
Method	For calculation of the MSD of the relative motion, the following relation was used43where r(t) is the position of the particle at time t, δt is the time between frames (successive images), Δt is the time lag separating the locations such that nδt = Δt, with n the number of frames separating the locations, and N is the total number of steps in the trajectory.
Goal	Measurement of diffusion in Langmuir monolayers by single-particle tracking
Background	Their occurrence was merely indirectly deducted, e.g., from protein-clustering experiments.11
Background	In summary, long experimental observation times compared to those possible for SPT studies of the cell surface enabled us to demonstrate that (camera) noise can lead to the assumption of subdiffusion while interpreting the data of single-particle-tracking experiments.
Method	From 0.5–5 μm, dr0 is a square of 10−2 μm side length.
Method	In this study, random walks were generated with fixed time steps to represent particle trajectories.
Result	Free and strikingly confined diffusion to the domain-edge were demonstrated in the LE phase.
Background	The diffusion constants obtained (1–10 μm2 s−1) agree with those from spectroscopic measurements.
Background	Monolayers at the air/water interface have a critical advantage over cells and lipid vesicles regarding the investigation of diffusion by SPT techniques.
Result	For beads displaying diffusion confined to the domain boundary, reduced diffusion coefficients were found when compared to free diffusion.
Conclusion	The real penetration depth may be different.
Experiment	Consequentially, monolayers were prepared on the subphase as follows: The lipids (DMPE or methyl palmitate) were dissolved in chloroform (concentration ∼0.5 mM) and the resulting solution was then mixed with approx. 0.5–1% (related to DMPE or methyl palmitate concentration) of Texas-Red labeled DPPE (dihexadecanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine) from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands).
Method	The diluted aqueous suspension of microspheres was prepared for SPT experiments according to the following procedure.
Method	The steptime Δt was chosen such that the actual change in F was not more than 2% from a linear relation.
Experiment	The video files (binary data) were analyzed using a tracking routine in IDL48 adopted for our system.43
Background	In Nassoy et al.’s work, considerably larger beads were chosen leading to dipolar bead moments that were orders of magnitude larger than for the beads we used.
Conclusion	In analogy, this suggests for the liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered coexistence in cell membranes with rafts, that the cell might be able to change the range of the domain potentials easily, increasing its ability to influence diffusion processes drastically.
Result	This was controlled by evaluation of trajectories with and without obstruction; no difference of diffusion coefficients was found.
Observation	Deviations from the noise-free behavior are significantly visible at short times.
Observation	The attractive potentials between LC domains and polystyrene beads obtained by this evaluation method had a depth of −4.5 ± 1.0 kBT and −6.0 ± 2.0 kBT for DMPE and for methyl palmitate monolayers, respectively.
Background	Furthermore, domain character and potential strength can be altered arbitrarily.
Conclusion	Monte-Carlo simulations supported this view point.
Conclusion	A related finding which agrees with our view point was reported in a previous publication describing attractive interaction of concanavalin A protein patches of 1 μm size on water subphases with LC domains within DMPE monolayers.58
Method	In order to circumvent the small dimensions of cells leading to weak statistics when investigating the diffusion properties of single membrane components, a technique based on optical microscopy employing Langmuir monolayers as membrane model systems has been developed in our lab.
Background	This depends strongly on the interaction between the bead surface (carboxyl coated polystyrene) and the aqueous subphase, the surface tension of the monolayer, and the bead–lipid interaction.
Experiment	Carboxylated fluorescent microspheres (FluoSpheres, yellow-green fluorescent (505/515), 200 nm diameter, were purchased from Molecular Probes Co. (Leiden, Netherlands)).
Result	As observed for DMPE45, within the methyl palmitate monolayers only normal diffusion was found and as can be seen by the value of the scaling exponent α = 0.99 ± 0.24.
Observation	An example for such an evaluation is given in Fig. 2B which corresponds to the diffusion experiment visualized in Fig. 2A.
Method	The size of Δr was chosen to values equaling half of the bead diameter.
Model	For this system, only normal diffusion can be expected according to the free-volume model for diffusion.41
Conclusion	This was caused by an attractive potential generated by condensed domains within monolayers.
Experiment	Pictures were recorded by use of an appropriate video microscopy system with a time resolution of 30 s−1.
Background	Anomalous, non-Brownian diffusion was reported for different membrane components.
Method	For the resulting calculations, the domain radius R was varied from 0.25 nm (∼radius of a single lipid chain) to 100 μm.
Background	Using optical tweezers, barrier free lengths for proteins of 1–10 μm were found.9
Background	Correlation with noise inherent to all SPT measurements was initially noted.43
Model	F(r) = −dU(r)/drv = F/ξΔr = vδt
Experiment	The Langmuir trough already mentioned in Section 245 was covered by a steel lid with appropriate holes allowing for microscopical observation and measurement of the surface tension.
Model	Particle and noise intensity distributions were assumed to be Gaussian profiles according to experimental findings.
Background	The transport of a signal mediated by components of a membrane can occur through lateral diffusion.1
Conclusion	We could conclude that noise can lead in general to the assumption of subdiffusion while interpreting the results of single-particle-tracking (SPT) experiments within membranes in general.
Motivation	There are numerous indications that lipid rafts might play also a central role in diseases as, e.g. virus infections, Alzheimer and prion diseases.22
Experiment	Images were recorded by a SIT (Silicon Intensified Tube) Dage-MTI VE 1000 camera (Michigan City, IN, USA,) in PAL or NTSC mode (25 or 30 frames per second, respectively).
Observation	For the polystyrene beads investigated in inhomogeneous monolayers under the experimental conditions, free and domain-edge associated diffusion was observed for both within DMPE45 and methyl palmitate.
Method	Following the method described by Saxton,28 a probability distribution for the step size r was used.with δt as the time between two steps, which equals 1/25 s due to the camera frame rate used in the experiments.
Background	However, it was found that the cell membrane is inhomogeneous over different time and length scales.3
Experiment	The surface drift of the monolayers was reduced to 3–1 μm s−1 depending on the phase state of the monolayer allowing for track lengths up to 20 000 to 35 000 steps.
Background	However, free diffusion was observed for lipids within a membrane, too.12
Model	The dipolar moment of the bead is μb = πσa2λD where σ is the charge density on the bead surface, a is the diameter of the bead.
Method	However, this approach is only exact for square domains and distances r > 2 μm.
Background	The latter can be explained by a charge separation due to a counterion layer in the subphase nearby to the negatively charged sulfonated surface of the polystyrene beads used.55
Result	Again, the experimental and theoretically predicted values match relatively well (cf. Table 1).
Result	For DMPC at the air/water interface and different packing densities normal diffusion was found.
Result	Moreover, long-time simulations show that diffusion coefficients of respective particles were dependent on the strength of the attractive potential present: a behavior reflecting altered dimensionality of diffusion.
Background	The actual size of these confinements for the lateral protein motion seems to be dependent on the cell type investigated.4–8
Background	Lipid rafts, as a potential third category, presumably have a size of 25–300 nm and represent mobile lipid organizations which differ with respect to their composition from their environment.10,14,18–21
Background	Furthermore, the diffusive speed of integral proteins in biological membranes is decreased by one order of magnitude up to immobility compared to the less complex model membranes.13
Conclusion	A source for errors in calculating the maximal potential theoretically might be the depth the bead penetrates into the water subphase.
Experiment	In a first series of experiments, DMPE (1,2-dimyristoyl sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine) monolayers46 were spread on a physiological subphase (phosphate buffered saline, cf. Section 3).
Conclusion	The localization mechanism for diffusing probe particles which can be concluded from our experiments and simulations could enhance reaction kinetics in membranes by increasing the local concentration of reacting components and by restriction of diffusive transport to one dimension.
Result	The transition occured at a domain size which is related to the size of potential lipid rafts.
Experiment	As a subphase, about 100 ml of potassium-free phosphate buffered saline at pH = 7.5 (PBS, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM phosphate, ionic strength, I, at 20 °C = 0.189 mol l−1) was prepared using Millipore water.
Method	(cfref. 43., and this paper, Section 2).
Conclusion	The contribution of interface forces to interactions affecting diffusion should be considerably larger for, e.g. quantum dots, which have, with their hydrophilic shells, diameters on the order of magnitude of the monolayer thickness.
Goal	Simulations were performed to support the interpretation of the experimental findings.
Background	Molecular dynamics calculations of the interactions of proteins, lipids and water molecules were carried out but the corresponding length scale is limited to very short distances (∼1 nm).26
Background	Since subdiffusion can be excluded for such a homogeneous system, an artifact due to basic problems of the data analysis had to be to considered.
Model	For normal Brownian diffusion, the exponent α remains 1.
Background	Moreover, the packing density of a monolayer at the air/water interface can be conveniently varied at a constant temperature which is not possible for supported bilayers.
Conclusion	Thus, the cell might control signaling processes and protein reactions by simply growing or shrinking the domains or locally increasing the domain curvature.
Background	In Langmuir monolayers, a broad variable range of length scales within inhomogeneous structures is accessible.
Model	Assuming a mean error of the particle position σ, the MSD is dependent on this noise:MSD = 4DΔt + 2σ2.
Model	The interaction potential with the dipolar moment of a polystyrene bead, μb, is calculated as the product of μb and E(r).
Conclusion	This mechanism is not described yet and could have a similar significance for reaction kinetics in membranes as the reduction of dimensionality from three to two dimensions which is achieved by integration of proteins into the membranes.
Object	In the following sections, further measurements on bead diffusion in inhomogeneous membranes characterized in another inhomogeneous monolayer system are presented.
Result	Small changes in potential can be attributed in various ways to the variability in the bead dipole moment.
Experiment	DMPC monolayers were used which form homogeneous phases under standard conditions.40
Result	These calculations indicated a transition in the functional dependence on the distance of the electrical field from a single dipole to the behaviour of an semi-infinite wall.
Object	Possible consequences for cellular membranes due to the mechanisms found are also discussed.
Model	This constant accounts for the dielectric properties within the monolayer.
Method	This mimics the motion of associated proteins in a membrane.
Method	The diffusion coefficients were obtained from a linear fit, the time exponents from logarithmic fits of different data evaluation programs (cf. Sections 1 and 2).
Method	In the random walks, generally a diffusion coefficient of 1 μm2 s−1 was applied.
Method	The strength of the potential based on dipolar interactions between domain and latex beads applied in these Monte Carlo simulations can be adjusted to fixed values by changing of one of the relevant constants μb or Δρμ.
Object	This system mimics the interaction between negatively charged proteins and condensed membrane domains.
Conclusion	The diffusion coefficient D = (1.1 ± 0.2) μm2 s−1 was in good agreement with the results from other measurements obtained by ensemble methods, e.g. FRAP.44
Experiment	Before each individual experiment, the bead suspension was briefly sonicated (<60 s), to loosen possible weak conglomerates.
Method	The methods used for experiments and simulations of the model are described in Section 3.
Result	For the systems investigated by us, a relatively good agreement can be found comparing the theoretically predicted maximal potentials to the ones obtained experimentally as summarized in Table 1.
Background	Currently, the lipid raft mixtures have been frequently investigated by different methods.8,39
Conclusion	Thus, the results are presented and discussed together.
Background	Reactions dependent on diffusion may proceed faster in the two dimensions of the membrane than in the three dimensions of the cytoplasm.2
Result	For the DMPE system, it is clearly possible to explain the behavior observed by pure dipolar attraction.
Conclusion	A possible way to address the question if dipolar interaction does explain also the strength of the interaction potential of smaller charged beads within inhomogeneous monolayers would be the use of model proteins that are much smaller by orders of magnitude.
Experiment	The liquid expanded (LE) phase was visualized by fluorescently labeled lipids which partitionate preferably into this phase.47
Method	Assuming that the point density follows a Boltzmann distribution51 one can obtain U(r) from ρ(r), according toU(r) = −kBT log(ρ(r)) + Cwhere the absolute energy can be set by choosing C. In order to calculate ρ(r), the amount of times the particle visited area units normalized to equal probabilities of being for the diffusing particle was determined.
Method	In order to obtain a highly unperturbed monolayer, air flow, convection in the subphase and vibrations of the system had to be minimized.
Experiment	20 ml of the supernatant were transferred into smaller (10 ml) glass bottles.
Observation	For domain-edge associated diffusion the respective values are 0.38 ± 0.05 μm2 s−1, and 0.41 ± 0.12 μm2 s−1.
Observation	The exponent C for the dependence E ∼ rC was depicted as a function of the exponentially growing domain radius R. For LC domains in a LE phase, a striking increase of C is observed in this representation at a domain size of 10 nm–1000 nm.
Result	New results on these models and interpretations are presented and discussed in significant extracts in Section 4.
Model	The simulation of motion within obstacles is obtained by a simple model for particle domain edge interaction.
Result	Simple assumptions lead to estimates of the bead penetration of 35%–50% of the total bead diameter.55
Background	As a second category, proteins with condensed lipid shells of a 10 nm diameter come into play.17
Result	The diffusion coefficient measured for domain-associated bead motion is about one half of the diffusion coefficient of a freely in the monolayer diffusing particle.
Method	For these calculations, an analytical approach published earlier53 can be used which was derived from eqn. (11).
Result	This observation was also supported by Monte Carlo simulations on comparable time scales.
Model	We conclude that also the carboxylated beads used in this study have an analogous dipolar moment.
Method	For this purpose, a Langmuir film balance system was designed and built that reduces these effects by isolation of the liquid surface from the lab environment.
Conclusion	In the light of these findings, experimental results indicating subdiffusion on cell surfaces have to be re-evaluated.
Object	The trajectories for random walks of 1 × 106 time steps demonstrated high similarity to the experimental results at the relevant potential depths of about 5 kBT. Domain-associated diffusion was also simulated.
Result	This method gave consistent results up to domain sizes of 100 nm.
Conclusion	Further reduction of the coefficient might be explained by additional friction occuring during the movement along the domain border.
Experiment	The particle position per frame was determined applying modified IDL routines.42
Result	A constant error was obtained which is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio, the particle width and the tracking method.
Model	Here, we rely on the values for Δρμ given by Miller et al.46
Background	At an obstacle concentration of 12.5% (circular domains in 4 μm diameter separated by 10 μm) the diffusion of the particles is unchanged from free diffusion.
Experiment	All measurements were performed at room temperature (ϑ ≈ 22 °C).
Result	A transition between two dimensional and one dimensional diffusion explains this since the relations MSD = 4DΔt and MSD = 2DΔt are valid for two-dimensional and for one-dimensional Brownian diffusion, respectively.
Background	The motion of proteins can be confined to regions of 100 nm to 1 μm size for a time from 3–35 s.
Method	A quantitative method to determine an interaction potential U(r) is based on the particle density ρ(r) as a function of the distance from the domain edge r.
Model	Thus, when the particle is crossing the domain interface, the particle is reflected, traveling back into the fluid region.
Method	Immobile fluorescent microspheres within the LC phase (mainly nucleation seeds) were used to determine the collective drift of the surface, which was subtracted from trajectories of diffusing particles.
Experiment	The length of the tracks was up to 30 min.
Observation	This approach results in potentials for the DMPE system of −6.3kBT calculated and (−4.5 ± 1.0)kBT measured.
Background	The basic tile is a fluid square with a circular solid circle in the center.
Experiment	DMPE was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Al, USA), methyl palmitate was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).
Method	Simulations of random walks can be performed applying pure obstructions in form of LC domains.
Result	Domain-edge associated diffusion can be ascribed to an interaction between charged beads and domains.
Experiment	A single trough for spreading the monolayer, compression and observation was used.
Method	According to eqn. (1), the standard method to find the scaling exponent is a linear fit to:log(MSD(Δt)) = α log(Δt) + log(4D).
Method	Moreover, the theoretically achievable maximal attractive potentials are listed and compared to the experimentally observed values.
Model	For a given energy profile U(r), the force on the particle F, the velocity of the particle v, and displacement of the particle Δr are calculated from eqns. (7), (8) and (9).
Background	For the latter, the only interaction between probe particle and domain is reflection.
Method	The scaling exponent was obtained by a linear fit of log(MSD) vs. log(Δt) (cf. eqn. (3), below).
Experiment	This is approximately the case at lateral pressures π > 10 mN m−1 and π > 1 mN m−1 for DMPE and methyl palmitate, respectively.
Method	Other minor modifications of the programs were necessary to change from the NTSC to the PAL system.
Background	Lipid diffusion within a membrane can be confined for times of less than a second to regions of 250–750 nm size within the cell membrane.10,11
Experiment	According to the manufacturer, the surface charge was 0.073 milli-equivalent per gram (data sheet).
Method	The other method is a numerical integration of eqn. (11).
Model	To find the diffusion coefficient for Brownian motion, the linear plot gives D as the slope and 2σ2 as the intercept.
Observation	The results for α derived from individual experimental trajectories for particles within inhomogeneous methyl palmitate monolayers are summarized by the presentation in Fig. 3.
Experiment	Data were transfered via a frame grabber card (Ni-Daq) connected to a suitable PC system.
Background	It was concluded that a high fraction of these previously published data5,6,10 can be explained by the interplay of normal diffusion and camera noise.
Result	Some deviation from an ideal curve in the small domain size regime is caused by the use of a hexagonal lattice.
Result	The domain-associated diffusion shown in Fig. 2A for the methyl palmitate model system is apparently due to an attractive interaction between domains and charged beads.
Method	In order to generalize the nature of the model membrane, in a second series of experiments methyl palmitate was applied forming monolayers which are not charged due to the respective molecular structure.
Method	We also use the approach of these authors in this paper.
Method	This allowed us variation of the lateral pressure during observation.
Background	Indications for the occurrence of subdiffusion were apparently found in the experiments with DMPC monolayers.
Method	The maximal depth at a distance of 100 nm from the domain, corresponding to the polystyrene bead radius, was determined to U ≈ −4.6kBT by fitting the data using a dependence of U(r) ∼ 1/|r|.
Result	The widths of those potentials were also found to be affected by the domain size of the more ordered lipid phase.
Model	We assume that the Δρμ value for these monolayers is within the range as given for various phospholipids in the cited reference publication.46
Background	Membranes seem to be relatively homogenous systems where lateral diffusion could be described easily.
Result	Simulated random walks (cf. Section 3) indicated that a higher/lower Δr is not feasible.
Conclusion	By the mechanism described in this work, the range of interaction between more ordered domains of potential lipid raft size scale and diffusing charged proteins could be influenced.
Method	In our lab, a technique was established enabling single-particle-tracking (SPT) experiments in monolayers at the air/water-interface.
Method	E(r) was calculated for 50 nm < r < 20 μm.
Conclusion	Nevertheless, in our case surface interactions seem not to be more significant than for the system used by Nassoy et al.
Experiment	20 μl of the microsphere suspension as obtained by the manufacturer were diluted in 40 ml of 100 mM PBS buffer, briefly vortexed and then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 5 min to ensure the sedimentation of bead conglomerates.
Background	For methyl palmitate monolayers, to the best of our knowledge no specific surface potential data are available in the literature.
Result	Therefore, the width of the resulting potential affecting a mobile dipole within the membrane, which is in our experiments a charged latex bead, changes.
Conclusion	Epifluorescence microscopy coupled to SPT revealed that domain associated, dimensionally reduced diffusion can occur in these kinds of model systems.
Result	This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5 which represents the distance dependence of the electric field on R, the domain radius.
Experiment	Direct observation of the effect of membrane inhomogeneities on diffusion of polystyrene beads within the model membranes was achieved by utilization of an experimental setup where dual band fluorescence microscopy was coupled to SPT (for details, cf. Forstner et al45. and Section 3 of this paper).
Method	From the trajectories, the long-time diffusion coefficient was determined by a linear MSD vs. Δt plot.
Background	Simulated random walks can be extended far beyond the time scales of the experiments.
Conclusion	This change in size could be achieved by protein clustering processes or by specific fusion of membrane regions with vesicles containing raft lipids.
Experiment	Due to the specific set-up, drift speed of the monolayer was reduced to <1 μm s−1.
Conclusion	It is conceivable that the speed of signal transduction is increased drastically by localization of the interacting messengers at the edge of a microdomain.
Method	The distribution is inverted to calculate the step size on a uniform random variable [0,1] and the direction is picked randomly from [0,2π].28
Background	Increasing interest in understanding the basis of lipid and protein diffusion led to the development of various experimental models of the cell membrane, e.g. lipid vesicles with incorporated proteins,32 planar supported bilayers,33 with one or more membrane double layers on solid supports which were used for lipid and protein diffusion measurements.34,35
Method	A Gaussian fit of the pixel intensity was calculated.49
Method	The position can be shifted by overlapping noise leading to an error in the particle position.
Method	The density ρ(r) was calculated and the depth of the attractive potential U(r) was obtained setting the constant C so that U(r) converges to zero at large distances as depicted in Fig. 2B.
Method	The integral is calculated within a 0.5 μm radius of r, with a dr0 that is a square of 10−3 μm side length.
Method	Additionally, the effect an interaction potential was added50 in order to include interactions between beads and domains.
Model	For our experiments as well as for the study published by Nassoy et al53. the relevant dipole interaction parameters of beads and domains are given in Table 1.
Result	This behavior is typical if the underlying electric field is generated by a semi-infinite dipolar plate given by:This situation applies to a small probe particle in front of a large domain.
Background	Inhomogeneity was experimentally shown for the two main classes of membrane components, both for lipids and for proteins, by demonstration of restricted mobility.
Background	The two-dimensional liquid-crystalline membranes generally consist in a diverse amphiphilic lipid bilayer where proteins are differently integrated.
Result	Although two structurally different lipid species, DMPE and methyl palmitate, were studied very similar results were obtained.
Method	These simulations were performed under use of 4 μm domains on a 10 μm square lattice.
Result	In this experiment, a polystyrene bead within the LE phase close to a LC phase of a methyl palmitate monolayer clearly demonstrates domain-associated motion.
Background	In order to understand the results on membrane diffusion experiments, computer simulation methods were developed and performed.
Model	λD is the Debye length approximated bywhere I is the ionic strength of the subphase used.
Model	Subdiffusive processes exhibit α < 1.
Experiment	The diffusion of the beads within the liquid-expanded (LE) lipid monolayer phase was observed for long time scales.
Object	In a second step, the motion of carboxylated polystyrene beads within inhomogeneous monolayers was examined.
Result	Due to the logarithmic scale, noise appears large at short times whereas at long times the real character of the motion (normal diffusion) becomes obvious.
Experiment	For filtration of subphase solution, Anotop 25 0.2 μm filters were utilized.
Motivation	However, the size of domains within inhomogeneous biological membranes is assumed to be 300 nm and less, lying beyond the resolution of optical epifluorescent microscopy used in our experiments.
Background	The experimental results of the DMPE system and the evaluation method are discussed in greater detail in a separate contribution52.
Model	The analysis of the logarithmic plot of the MSD which is used to determine whether a particle behaves subdiffusively is more complex since noise generates an initial slope resulting in an apparent scaling coefficient, αapp which might by expressed by
Experiment	Within the trough, smaller observation and surface tension measurement areas were partially separated from the main part of the respective liquid surface by compartments.
Model	Here, ξ is the friction coefficient of the particle.
Conclusion	From the graph, it can be concluded that the long-time diffusion constant is apparently very sensitive to the potential in which the particle diffuses.
Method	This method leads to fields that are accurate to 5% beyond 10−2 μm from the edge of a domain and can be used down to domain sizes of 10 nm diameter.56
Result	The error for the experimentally found potentials might be also considered as too low since the measurements are still away from equilibrium (Boltzmann) conditions.
Conclusion	It was demonstrated that the measured diffusive speed of the lipid was independent on the size of the gold particle.
Motivation	Lateral transport plays a key role in biological processes such as, e.g. cellular signal transduction within the cell membrane and membrane formation.
Method	The tracking routine employed finds the center of the particle using a weighted average of pixel intensities, taking the center of this average as the particle position.
Background	This strength was reported to be firstly dependent on the electric field generated due dipolar difference within the monolayer between the solid phase and the surrounding fluid, Δρμ,54 and secondly dependent on the dipole moment of the beads, μb.
Background	More details are available in Martin et al.30
Method	In the neighborhood of the domain where a rapid change of U(r) occurs (cf. Fig. 2, Sections 4.2 and 4.3) time steps as small as 10−9 s were necessary.
Observation	The bead motion close to the LC phase is illustrated in Fig. 2A, where the respective superimposed trajectory of a bead diffusing within LE phase and the inhomogeneous monolayer region under observation are shown.
Method	The diffusion coefficients were obtained by a linear fit of the data to eqn. (1).
Background	Later, full membrane extracts37 or multi-component systems in which phase separated lipids form obstructions for diffusion were studied.38
Hypothesis	In the area of the steep decrease in Fig. 6 small variation of the parameters affecting the dipolar interactions in the experiment, e.g. by alteration of the packing density of the lipids or change in bead surface charge, should be able to induce significant change in the diffusive behaviour from one-dimensional to two-dimensional and vice versa.
Background	Membrane components coming into question as potential obstructions can be arranged according to their size.
Background	The position of the particle was determined with a precision of 100 nm.
Method	One approach we used summarizes over single lipid dipoles located on a hexagonal lattice forming as an entity a circular domain.
Result	As already mentioned above, the potential found, U(r) shows a 1/r dependence.
Experiment	This solution was spread on the aqueous surface.
Conclusion	This behavior seems to be generally observed for these kinds of model systems.
Background	For proteins in the plasma membrane, exponents in the range of α = 0.1–0.9 were found.5,24,25
Background	So, also the calculated potential dependencies as a function of distance from the domain edge must be considered as too high under the conditions assumed by these authors.
Conclusion	In short, it can be concluded that the form of the potential and thus its range depend strongly on the size of the domains.
Conclusion	Tracking of the motion of a scattering gold nano particle bound to a single lipid molecule within a monolayer at the air/water interface over long time intervals by means of dark field microscopy was demonstrated.
Conclusion	In biological membrane systems, cells could utilize these physical mechanisms to adjust diffusion properties of membrane components.
Method	Single-particle tracking experiments were performed with polystyrene beads which are negatively charged due to dissociation of carboxyl groups exposed to the aqueous subphase.
Method	From 5 μm to a cutoff length of 50 μm, dr0 is a square 0.1 μm side length.
Model	Particles bounce off the domain edge, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
Method	For simulating diffusion of particles within a liquid-expanded phase with liquid-expanded domains, a lattice of solid domains was used.
Method	Monte Carlo methods can give results regarding diffusion on length scales which correspond to those of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and SPT data (in the range of 10−9–10−6 m).27–30
Background	The focus of interest was on the measurement of the strength of the bead–domain interaction.
Conclusion	Thus, particles which diffuse only in “one” dimension, i.e. along a line (i.e. the border of the domain), have a diffusion coefficient only half as large as freely diffusing particles in two dimensions.
Motivation	Nevertheless, thus far these ordered domains could not be directly observed.
Background	In the former publication,53 the diffusion of the particles was not characterized in detail.
Result	Only normal Brownian diffusion has been found as determined from the scaling exponent which was α = 0.95 ± 0.05 for both free and domain-edge associated diffusion.
Background	The concanavalin A patches have to be considered as macroscopic aggregations and are far away to serve as models for single membrane proteins diffusing in monolayers.
Method	Nevertheless, for the calculation of the MSD due to pure diffusive motion the relative motion of two neighboring particles with position a and b was utilized.
Method	Random walks were used to simulate recorded measurements.
Background	Hence, the biological membrane is currently considered to be an inhomogeneous fluid with structures on length scales of 1 nm to 10 μm which affect the lateral diffusion.15
Background	However, these authors overestimated the dipolar density difference or excess dipolar density Δρμ since they used a value calculated for the dipolar density of the LC phase of pentadecanoic acid from the molecular dipole moment given for octadecanoic acid in an earlier reference.57
Conclusion	Furthermore, surface charges may vary between different beads and lead to a distribution of interaction strengths.
Object	Surface charged polystyrene latexes were used as model proteins diffusing in inhomogeneous monolayers as biomembrane mimics.
Background	There is a great amount of literature available indicating that membranes are inhomogeneous, complex fluids.
Background	This is the large observable area leading to long observation times.
Result	The area close to the interface is obviously more frequently visited during the obversation time.
Observation	For free diffusion (no interaction with the domain recognized) diffusion coefficients of 0.75 ± 0.10 μm2 s−1 and 1.31 ± 0.30 μm2 s−1 were obtained for DMPE and methyl palmitate, respectively.
Method	The error of the position was determined by comparison of the underlying random walk and the trajectories yielded by the tracking routine.
Object	The strength and the origin of the interaction between beads and domains is analyzed.
Goal	In order to study the effect of varied dipolar interaction on diffusion of model proteins within membranes, simulations were carried out assuming varied potential strengths.
Experiment	Observation times for the tracking experiments ranged up to about 150 s.
Goal	To verify our experimental approach, at first the diffusion of lipids within homogeneous monolayers was studied.
Experiment	Observation times of up to 20 min were achieved due to the relatively rigid properties of the DMPE liquid-condensed (LC) phase.
Background	The former appears at long times normal whereas it may appear at short times as anomalous.29
Background	The implementation of particle traps made the simulation of anomalous diffusion possible.31
Background	The attractive interaction was explained by different electric polarization of the protein patches and the lipid environment.
Background	Proteins (25–75% of membrane mass16) can be considered as a first category of obstacles on a length scale of few nanometers.
Method	The bead motion within the monolayers was followed by video microscopy as described above.
Model	Diffusion of a laterally moving particle within the membrane can be described by the temporal scaling behavior of the mean square displacement (MSD) in dependence on the time Δt23〈r2〉 = MSD(Δt) = 4DΔtαwhere r(t) is the particle position at the time t, D the diffusion coefficient and α the scaling exponent.
Background	In the phase coexistence region e.g. in the liquid-expanded/liquid-condensed coexistence, inhomogeneities are characteristic and the size of occurring domains can be varied by altering the lateral pressure.
Model	It is assumed that the electric field E of the domains in a distance from the domain, r, can be calculated from the dipole density difference as follows, where r0 is the radius of the domain and A is the area of the domain:For the permittivity ε, a value of 7 is used as in .ref. 53
Method	Two compartments were integrated for surface tension measurement and for observation of the monolayers.
Method	For a linear relation of F(Δr), the displacement Δr can be calculated from the mean force acting on the particle, i.e. from the force at the midpoint of the step.
Experiment	The lipid monolayer and the fluorescent polysterol latex particles were visualized using an epi-fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX30M, Leeds Instruments Inc, USA) equipped with an Olympus 50 × 0.8 NA darkfield objective, a 100 W Hg-high pressure bulb (Osram HBO 103W/2) and a dual-band filter (51006 FITC/TR Chroma, Brattleboro, VT, USA).
Conclusion	A change of the potential could be also induced by alteration of the particle nature or the subphase.
Model	The sole influence of obstacles on the diffusion coefficient under these conditions is negligible (cf. methods).
Method	In the following section, recent achievements in developing the method of SPT on Langmuir monolayers are briefly summarized.
Observation	The variation of the attractive potentials calculated from our data of bead motion in DMPE monolayers is exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 4.
Background	However, evidence for the occurrence of subdiffusion by single-particle-tracking methods is often based on short trajectories where the scaling arguments can be inaccurate.
Background	Penetration of the LC phase boundary by the protein patches was not observed which was explained by packing constraints.
Method	The random walk was then resampled at the experimental video rate.
Background	Results of these simulations show, e.g. that a 10- to 100-fold decrease of the diffusion coefficient can arise from protein concentrations close to the percolation threshold.
Method	In our study, we used two different numerical methods for the calculation of such electric fields which were appropriate for varied domain sizes.
Background	Within the scope of earlier studies homogeneous one-component systems were investigated.36
Experiment	35 μl of the diluted suspension were added to the subphase in the Langmuir trough.
Background	At protein concentration above the percolation threshold, only confined diffusion is found.

Conclusion	We underline a fact that only the variational approach can include all resonances, and therefore it must be recommended when it is possible.)
Conclusion	Even so, we believe that these qualitative spectra will be useful in molecular identification, at least.
Model	It also allows us to treat all kinds of transitions on an equal footing, which is especially important for variational calculations which mix transitions of various characters (e.g. fundamental, overtone, combination).
Conclusion	All one needs are quartic potential energy surfaces and cubic dipole surfaces, expanded in normal coordinates.
Background	To study molecular vibrations it is necessary to solve the Schrödinger equation for nuclear motion.
Result	The stick spectra representing vibrational transitions from the ground vibrational state, obtained by variational and perturbational calculations for furan and pyrrole, are compared with scaled experimental results of Mellouki et al12. in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.
Background	For more information about the programs MULTIMODE and SPECTRO and their use, see for example refs. 1 and 2.
Result	Higher excited states can be produced, but the quality of the results is not the same.
Model	If we assume an equilibrium distribution, then for the transitions originating from the ground vibrational state the term (Nv – Nv′) tends to 1.
Model	This formula does not sum over hot and stimulated emission bands, which can all be treated explicitly.
Object	Infrared intensities of furan, pyrrole and thiophene: beyond the double harmonic approximation
Background	The paper is organised as follows.
Model	While there are many different coordinate systems in which the kinetic and potential energy operators can be expressed, for larger molecules the only expansion of the kinetic energy operator, which is not prohibitively complicated, is in terms of normal coordinates.5
Observation	It can be observed that overtone and combination bands obtained from MULTIMODE are shifted towards higher wavenumbers with respect to those obtained from SPECTRO.
Result	(A referee has observed that it is difficult to see from Figs. 2(a) and (b) that the variational treatment represents an improvement over the perturbational approach.
Method	In Section 2 we discuss the potential and dipole fields, variational and perturbation approaches used to evaluate the transition dipole moments and calculation of infrared intensities from these moments.
Observation	In the region above 2000 cm–1 there are more states shown in the variational calculation panels than in the corresponding second-order perturbation calculation and experiment panels.
Conclusion	An ab initio or DFT quantum chemistry code which calculates analytic second derivatives is also required.
Result	In Section 3 we present and discuss the results for furan, pyrrole and thiophene.
Result	In Section 4 we summarise the findings and outline future directions.
Background	This approach was tested recently for water and formaldehyde.2
Result	Also the density of states is higher for pyrrole, which leads to an increase in the number and strength of resonances.
Result	Comparison with experiment is complicated by the lack of firm experimental data.
Method	The CI expansion included all single, double, triple and quadruple VCI excited states with the sum of vibrational quantum numbers less than or equal to four.
Result	This is due to the relatively small size of the CI.
Method	While there are many resonances present in the systems studied, none of the resonances are very strong.
Observation	For pyrrole there are some disagreements, most notably for the states involving ν16.
Method	While this program is capable of treating low-level resonances by removing the divergent terms and explicitly solving 2 × 2 CI problems (or by providing matrix elements for larger CI problems), second-order perturbation theory does not handle resonances involving states with the sum of vibrational quantum numbers being larger than 2.
Result	The quality of our results is immediately apparent by comparing Fig. 1(a) (MULTIMODE) with Fig. 1(c) (experiment), for furan, and likewise Figs. 2(a) and (c) for pyrrole.
Result	It seems that inclusion of resonances would be necessary for a proper perturbation description of intensities in pyrrole; however, this would eliminate much of the simplicity of the second-order perturbative approach, and this is one of its most attractive features.
Background	Mellouki et al12. published relative intensities for furan and pyrrole.
Model	Evaluating the fraction and converting to practical units leads to a working formula with νa in cm–1 and Rαij in debye.
Background	The next logical step is to expand the dipole moment vector as a Taylor series in normal coordinates and calculate anharmonic contributions to the infrared intensities.
Observation	The peaks corresponding to fundamental transitions νi are labeled by i.
Background	For example Hirano et al3. have recently used the Morbid program4 to predict and compare spectra for MgNC and MgCN.
Result	As observed previously1 this mode shows large negative anharmonicity and is probably not adequately described by a quartic Taylor expansion.
Observation	Since, to our knowledge, there is no consistent set of experimental infrared intensities for thiophene available, Fig. 3 compares only calculated results.
Result	The results are compared graphically with second-order perturbation calculations and with relative intensities from experiment for furan and pyrrole.
Conclusion	The new feature of our science is its automatic capability of working beyond the double harmonic approximation, thus including anharmonicity, overtones and combination bands in our calculations.
Result	Nevertheless, the intensities of overtone and combination bands are in reasonable agreement with those obtained from SPECTRO and with the scaled experimental results.
Observation	For comparison with our stick spectra we have scaled the relative intensities of ref. 12 by factors of 22.2 for furan and 163 for pyrrole, respectively.
Method	A fuller discussion of the finite difference calculation, the effects of the step size, as well as values for the anharmonic constants may be found in .ref. 1
Conclusion	We have every reason to expect that the MULTIMODE predicted spectra (Fig. 3(a)) for thiophene would be close to observation.
Method	Finally, the matrix elements Rαij were evaluated using the dipole moment surface Dα(Q) and the CI vectors Ψ(Q): Rαij = ∫Ψi(Q)Dα(Q)Ψj(Q)dQSecond-order perturbation calculations were carried out using the program SPECTRO.11
Result	Also, only states which were properly assigned are included in the experimental panel.
Result	We agree, but we anticipate that as the molecules become larger, as a force field becomes more complicated with more complicated resonances, the difference between the variational and perturbational spectra will become more marked.
Background	Our earlier studies show that frequencies determined by DFT are in error by 1%, and the calculated intensities are also only very approximate, and without fine structure.
Model	The infrared intensities of a vi → v′j transitions were evaluated using the usual expression: where NA is Avogadro's constant, νa is the wavenumber of the transition, and Nv is the fraction of molecules in the state v.
Result	To calculate the wavenumbers of overtones it is necessary to include states with the sum of vibrational quantum numbers larger than four.
Observation	It can readily be seen that the agreement between the stick spectra calculated by variational and second-order perturbation approaches is, in general, very good, especially for furan and thiophene.
Result	In fact, all of these modes are strongly coupled to other modes, resulting in several modes each with lower intensity.
Model	The second and third derivatives of dipole moment, dαij and dαiij (where α is a Cartesian component of the dipole moment vector dαj referred to Eckart axes), are calculated in a manner analogous to the cubic and quartic force constants: Potential and dipole moment surfaces were calculated by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach using the B97-1 functional6 and a TZ2P basis set.
Background	While for small molecules there are many avenues along which to pursue infrared intensities of higher quality, for larger molecules (with more than five atoms) expansion in normal coordinates appears to be the only practical approach.
Method	Terms coupling up to three normal coordinates were used in the VSCF Hamiltonian.
Conclusion	Of course we have only looked at the wider detail.
Observation	Despite the above mentioned uncertainties in the experimental spectrum, it can be seen that the correspondence between theoretical and experimental results is good for these two molecules.
Method	The variational calculations were performed using the program MULTIMODE.8–10
Background	This paper is a continuation of our previous studies of vibrational transitions in five-membered aromatic ring compounds.1
Method	We use pure vibrational wavefunctions, and quartic force fields and cubic dipole moment vector surfaces, generated by density functional theory.
Conclusion	The larger the molecule, the more mixing is present.
Model	Therefore it is advantageous to express the potential energy also in terms of the normal coordinates.
Result	A proper description of combination bands further requires the inclusion of quintuple excitations in the CI.
Object	Infrared intensities of the fundamental, overtone and combination transitions in furan, pyrrole and thiophene have been calculated using the variational normal coordinate code MULTIMODE.
Model	If analytical second derivatives φjk are calculated at the equilibrium geometry and at the geometries displaced along the normal coordinates, cubic and semi-diagonal quartic force constants, φijk and φiijk, can be obtained by numerical differentiation: If infrared intensities are desired, also dipole moment field needs to be evaluated.
Method	This program performs vibrational self-consistent force field (VSCF) calculations, followed by the truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansion in virtual VSCF functions.
Background	We have found that both perturbative and variational approaches, based on the fourth degree Taylor expansion of the potential, yield energies of vibrational levels for fundamental and overtone transitions in excellent agreement with experimental data.
Model	Since the dipole moment is a derivative of the energy with respect to the electric field, the equivalent of the quartic expansion of the potential is a cubic expansion of the dipole surfaces.
Method	Therefore, we decided not to include any resonances in the present perturbation calculations with SPECTRO.
Conclusion	Finally, we are in the process of calculating ro-vibrational wavefunctions, from which band spectra can be obtained (for low J).
Result	However, if a stick spectrum is replaced by gaussians with finite width, the summed intensities are comparable.
Background	However, the authors caution that the data are not accurate.
Result	One of the consequences of the higher number of states and explicit treatment of all couplings in MULTIMODE are apparent in the lower intensities for high-frequency C–H and N–H stretches obtained from MULTIMODE, as compared with those obtained from SPECTRO.
Conclusion	A caveat to these results is that ideally we should perform as large a CI as possible within MULTIMODE in order to ensure that the overtones and combination bands are fully converged.
Conclusion	In this paper we have demonstrated the success of the variational code MULTIMODE to predict integrated band intensities for molecules.
Background	A number of scientists are now recognising the importance of comparing theoretical spectra with observation.
Method	This has an advantage of explicitly treating all resonances among states included in the CI expansion.
Result	This is due to the fact that MULTIMODE yields all states (as long as they are included in the CI expansion), while SPECTRO produces only states with the sum of vibrational quantum numbers less than or equal to two.
Method	The step size δQi was chosen such that it would correspond to an energy step of 1 mEh on the harmonic potential surface.
Method	Calculations were performed using the Cadpac program package.7
Observation	Transitions for which experimental intensities were not available are denoted with a star.

Conclusion	We are aware that the presented study is preliminary and quantitative structural information by surface crystallography or electron microscopy are appreciated to verify the presented hypotheses, especially for the presence of the FeO(111) interface layer after deposition of zirconia and annealing.
Observation	The Auger intensities of Zr (Fig. 4b) and the ZrO2(111)-(2 × 2) and Ru(0001)-(2 × 2) LEED patterns get slightly weaker during prolonged annealing while the intensity of the Ru(0001)-(1 × 1) pattern gets more and more intense.
Conclusion	We introduce an interfactant for zirconium oxide heteroepitaxy and propose that dispersed, epitaxial films of materials which are hard to crystallize are accessible by growing them on top of an ultrathin, polar FeO(111) film.
Result	It exhibits a hexagonal Moiré pattern with a 21.6 Å unit cell which results from coincidence of 7 FeO units with 8 Ru atoms.
Method	But epitaxial zirconia films have been grown on Pt(111)18 and Au(111)19 substrates despite a lattice mismatch of 25% and 30%, respectively.
Method	On Ru(0001), FeO(111) films grow with a thickness up to 4 ML and a lattice constant expansion of up to 3.58 Å (bulk: 3.04 Å).37
Conclusion	The novel concept of interfactant behavior is extended in this paper to oxide-on-oxide heteroepitaxy.
Method	The growth and structure of FeO(111) films on Pt and Ru substrates has been studied in detail28–30 because such films are interesting for magnetic studies of ferrites31 or as model catalysts.32,33
Experiment	The Ru(0001) single crystal was cleaned by cycles of Ar+-sputtering and annealing to 1450 K. Onto the clean substrate (as monitored by Auger and LEED), about 1 ML of Fe was deposited and oxidized in 10–6 mbar O2 at 870 K for a few minutes with a final anneal to 1000 K. Zirconia films are prepared by deposition of Zr and subsequent oxidation in 10–6 mbar at 800 K for ∼15 min and finally heating to 1150 K with 10 K s–1 and immediate cooling in 10–6 mbar O2.
Result	It still shows the O/Ru(0001)-(2 × 2) pattern, very weak (10) spots from FeO(111), and some new rotated diffraction spots corresponding to a real space lattice constant of about 3.08 Å and thus a lattice constant as the initial ultrathin FeO(111) film, however, rotated by 15°.
Background	Especially dispersed crystalline zirconia films are very difficult to obtain.
Conclusion	Such dissolution behaviour can be regarded as being due to a very low or even negative interface free energy,52 and thus from the point of view of the total energy balance, eqn. (1), would enhance the dispersion of the zirconia layer.
Background	Zirconia is a material which is of interest for many applications in solid electrolyte fuel cells, in electrolytical cells for sensor and pump devices, in optical coatings, or in catalysis.9
Method	STM studies on Ag(100) showed poor dispersioned and no diffraction patterns were obtained.16
Observation	FeO(111) monolayer films on Ru(0001) produce a characteristic LEED pattern (Fig. 2a).
Background	However, for small particles or thin films or with dopants like Y2O3, the high-temperature tetragonal or cubic phases may be stabilized.10–13
Background	In heteroepitaxy of mismatched materials, the situation is even worse due to significant contributions of the interface free energy.
Background	As epitaxial growth always takes place under nonequilibrium conditions, the oxidation kinetics is of high importance for the oxide phase and its crystallographic quality.25
Method	For this, the ZrO2(111) film was annealed to temperatures where previously alloying with the substrate occured.
Conclusion	Thus, in the holes no FeO(111) buffer layer is present, and this indicates that the presence of the FeO(111) film is beneficial for the adhesion of the zirconia film while the O/Ru(0001)-(2 × 2) structure is not.
Observation	After deposition of Zr and subsequent oxidation on such an FeO(111) film and after heating to 1150 K with 10 K s–1 in 10–6 mbar O2, we obtained a LEED pattern as shown in Fig. 3a.
Conclusion	However, even if Fe diffusion occurs in the zirconia film, this is no drawback as promotion of sulfated zirconia with Fe and Mn enhances the catalytic activity,51 and in this respect, the described substrate system may be an ideal candidate for model catalytic studies.
Background	So far, the surface chemistry of sulfated zirconia has not been investigated in detail, and suitable thin film systems accessible to electron-based surface science techniques have rarely been developed.14
Observation	The LEED patterns showed broadened substrate spots, no adlayer spots and an increased diffuse background.
Method	Also on Ru(0001), we were not able to obtain long-range ordered, epitaxial zirconia films by direct deposition of Zr on Ru(0001) in oxygen atmosphere or by subsequent oxidation.
Background	For oxide on oxide growth, the epitaxial growth mode is mainly determined by the interfacial energies arising from the lattice mismatch of the oxygen sublattices.25,38,39
Method	Such diffusion has been observed in an inverse Au(111)/ZrOx/FeO layer system.50
Observation	The Auger spectrum shows reduced Ru signals, and signals of Zr and O (Fig. 4a).
Method	Using a dense FeO(111) layer as an interfactant offers a way to circumvent these problems: The lattice constant of thin FeO(111) films on Ru(0001) expands considerably as it adjusts to the specific interface energetics,29,37 and fits significantly better with the lattice constant of zirconia films (3.59 Å).
Conclusion	In this way, we have obtained dispersed, cubic ZrO2(111) films with improved long-range order compared to previous studies.
Conclusion	An interfactant for metal oxide heteroepitaxy: Growth of dispersed ZrO2(111) films on FeO(111) precovered Ru(0001)
Background	For ultrathin oxide films, the growing phase may deviate from the expected bulk phases and interface-stabilized phases may form.30,41,42
Conclusion	We can only speculate about the origin of the hole formation: It may be due to diffusion of FeO into the substrate leaving a submonolayer FeO(111) film with uncovered Ru regions.
Background	The first point leads to a high interface energy and a low dispersion in order to minimize the interface contact area.
Background	However, some oxides do not wet due to a high interface free energy caused by lattice mismatch.
Method	The difficulties arise from the tremendous lattice mismatch with all transition metals due to the large lattice constant of ZrO2 which amounts to ∼3.6 Å for the cubic closed packed (111) and for the most stable tetragonal and monoclinic terminations.17
Background	Thus, the dense oxygen layer of the substrate system is beneficial for an electrostatic stabilization of the FeO(111) interface layer as well as the dispersed ZrO2(111) film.
Background	The chemical interaction with this buffer layer spreads the zirconia film on the substrate while at the same time alloying with the substrate may be suppressed.
Background	From the energy balance, eqn. (1), it follows that dispersed multilayer systems are only accessible when for all layers the surface free energy of the deposited film is lower than that of the underlying material, otherwise clustering is anticipated.
Result	Most studies on metal substrates showed that decomposition of ZrOx films starts beyond 900–1100 K, and we also observe an increase of the Ru Auger signal intensity.
Conclusion	The development of such multi-layer oxide systems is highly relevant in all fields, where thin closed oxide layers are required.
Background	Oxide coatings serve as thermal barriers or corrosion protectors for high-quality alloy or metal materials, e.g., in jet engines.2
Background	Metal-ceramic interfaces are of great interest for a large variety of technological applications.1
Conclusion	However, we cannot exclude that decomposition and diffusion of the iron oxide may have occurred.
Result	From the depth of the holes we can conclude that the averaged film thickness is about 6 Å.
Background	In general, the oxide stoichiometry is determined by the oxygen gas pressure.40
Background	Such interfactants have rarely been used so far.
Method	An STM investigation of zirconia films on Pt(111) revealed a hillock morphology and film decomposition and dewetting beyond 1000 K.20
Background	This mechanism has also been suggested for the wetting of Pd on FeO(111).27
Object	Next, we investigated whether the tendency for alloying is reduced in these films, i.e., whether still an FeO-associated “buffer layer” is present at the interface.
Background	For most applications, the growth of closed films is essential.
Conclusion	Alternatively, a restructuring of the FeO(111) monolayer film may occur, since previous studies on Pt and Ru showed that the lattice constant of these films varies strongly as it adjusts to the electrostatic, thermodynamic and interfacial energy gain associated with the interaction at the specific interface.29
Background	This terminating oxygen layer provides a close packed oxygen matrix upon which the zirconium can be deposited and further closed packed oxygen layers with interstitial zirconium cations can grow in the cubic calcium fluoride type structure.
Background	In order to circumvent these problems, one may introduce a suitable third component like surfactants21 which may lower the surface or interface energy as recently demonstrated for the growth of Co films on a hydroxylated alumina interface.22
Background	Or surface oxidation may generate a diffusion barrier between the substrate and a deposited metal film.26
Method	Deposition at 470 K yields significantly enhanced dispersion but beyond 1000 K the films decompose and become discontinuous.
Method	On several substrates, thermally stable, ultrathin FeO(111) films can be grown which have a strong in-plane lattice expansion in the initial growth stages.29,34–37
Background	The chemical interaction of the oxygen termination may spread the zirconia film onto the substrate system so that a wetting ZrO2 film may be obtained.
Conclusion	It was not possible to achieve atomic resolution on these films which may be due to their insulating character which requires high bias voltages.
Background	The growth of zirconium oxide on an oxide precovered metal involves two interfaces and requires additional consideration of the oxide–oxide interface.
Background	And for growth on Ni(111) a Ni–O surface termination with O–Zr–O repeat units on top is the energetically best configuration.13
Conclusion	There, the well-known O/Ru(0001)-(2 × 2) structure may have formed,47 which we always observe on FeO-uncovered Ru terraces after growth of submonolayer FeO(111) films.29
Result	Fig. 3e shows the distribution of the hole depth and gives an idea of the film thickness and homogeneity.
Background	The most stable modification of ZrO2 at room temperature is monoclinic.
Conclusion	However, even after 2 h annealing at 1200 K, STM shows that the morphology of these films has not changed at all (compare Fig. 3b with Fig. 3d) indicating a stable film structure and that decomposition mainly occurs via desorption of Zr and O. Although a direct chemical evidence for the presence of FeO at the interface is not available with our methods (Fe Auger signal intensities are too weak below the zirconia film), the observation of a lattice constant which matches a FeO(111) film even after annealing for long periods suggests that this layer separates the Ru substrate from the zirconia film.
Observation	Upon further annealing, this LEED pattern vanishes but still very weak unrotated main diffraction spots from FeO(111) and ZrO2(111)-(2 × 2) are seen.
Method	Details of FeO(111) films grown on Ru(0001) are presented elsewhere.29,37
Background	Heterogeneous catalysts consist often of metals in contact with oxides and the activity depends on the interaction between them.3
Background	The theoretical study by Goniakowski and Noguera also revealed that the adhesion energy for Zr on the isostructural MgO(111) is much higher on the close-packed O atoms and a much better wetting can be expected.46
Experiment	Iron metal was evaporated from an iron wire wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire.
Result	The holes are multiples of 3 Å deep which fits well with the step heights of energetically equivalent surface terminations of cubic ZrO2(111) (d = 2.9 Å).
Observation	Iron signals are almost absent.
Result	We attribute one of the two superimposed LEED patterns to the surface region of the thick film and the other to the holes.
Observation	Large scale STM images of such a film show characteristic round-edged holes with a depth of about 6–20 Å and an uniform diameter of ∼500–700 Å on otherwise very flat films (Fig. 3b).
Result	In general, FeO(111) films on Ru(0001) are very well ordered with the atomic rows of FeO(111) aligned with those of the Ru(0001) substrate.
Background	Also for α-Al2O3(0001) a much stronger interaction with an oxygen termination is calculated.12
Observation	After ∼60 min annealing to 1200 K with or without oxygen we observed the LEED pattern shown in Fig. 3c.
Result	All our attempts to form a closed ZrO2 film with reasonable long-range order by direct deposition of Zr on clean Ru(0001) in oxygen atmosphere or by subsequent oxidation failed.
Result	This pattern is similar to the (2 × 2) structures observed from cubic ZrO2(111) on Pt(111) and Au(111), but the lattice constant is reduced by ∼4% compared to cubic bulk ZrO2(111) (3.59 Å, i.e. 7.18 Å for a (2 × 2) structure).
Background	Another problem is the high tendency for alloying of Zr with all metals which was also observed in the studies on Au(111) and Pt(111) after anneling to temperatures above 900 K.
Background	However, due to the energy balance Δγ = γf + γI – γSof the surface free energies of the substrate γS, the growing film γf and the interface energy γI,15 most metals form compact particles on oxides (Δγ > 0) whereas oxide films mostly are dispersed on metal substrates (Δγ < 0).
Background	Note that NiO(111) is isostructural with FeO(111).
Method	Even the structure of the Pd–FeO interface was determined.27
Background	Ultrathin films and self-assembled nanostructures are currently attracting special interest for the development of electronic nanodevices and associated technologies4–7 since they often exhibit novel properties such as the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect.4,8
Background	As ZrO2 consists of alternating negatively and positively charged layers, dipole moments exist perpendicular to the surface and according to the classification introduced by Tasker43 such a type III polar surface can only be stabilized when charge compensated repeat units can be formulated so that the total dipole potential across the film vanishes, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 for the cubic phase along (111).
Method	A recent letter reports that Pd wets an ultrathin FeO(111) layer.
Method	Reactive restructuring leading to hole formation has recently been observed during deposition of oxide films on other substrate systems, e.g., during the growth of MgO films on Ag(001)48 and NiO films on Cu(111).49
Background	A buffer layer may distribute the strain in the growing film.25
Conclusion	In other words: An interfactant has to behave like a ‘glue’ sticking together the substrate and the film, a condition which is perfectly fulfilled for wetting, ‘floating’ FeO(111) films with their variable lattice constant adjustment and their strong adhesiveness which is due to a high tendency to reduce the polarity by an interfacial electron redistribution.
Background	Thus, the difficulty to obtain dispersed, long-range ordered zirconia films arises mainly from the generally large lattice mismatch and from the high tendency for alloying.
Conclusion	An effective interfactant requires (I) that the rigidity of the substrate is reduced, so that strain relieve can lead to a better epitaxy, (II) that it acts as a diffusion barrier, while on the other hand (III) the interaction with the substrate and also with the growing film has to be strong in order to achieve wetting of all layers.
Conclusion	In this study, we have introduced a new interfactant for heteroepitaxial metal oxide growth by precovering a metal substrate with a monolayer FeO(111) film.
Conclusion	The FeO(111) buffer layer seems to “float” between the zirconia and Ru.
Result	The presence of this pattern shows that the underlying FeO(111) film underwent restructuring during annealing induced by the overlayer zirconia film leading to FeO-uncovered hole regions.
Experiment	The experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber which is equipped with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM, Burleigh), a backview LEED optics with integrated Auger spectrometer (Omicron), an Ar+-sputter gun, two metal evaporators, ion gauges, and gas inlet systems.
Experiment	All STM measurements were performed at room temperature in the constant current mode.
Background	At the same time, the polar FeO(111) film may be stabilized in this way as has been treated theoretically for metal deposits on the polar, isostructural MgO(111) where a strong interfacial electron redistribution leads to the stabilization of polar oxide surfaces by metal deposits.46
Experiment	Zirconium metal was evaporated by electron bombardment from a zirconium wire.
Background	As emphasized by Noguera, the interface condition might be essential for the stabilization of polar structures,44,45 and specifically charge compensated repeat units of zirconia require the presence of an oxygen interface termination of the zirconia film to the substrate which is provided by the oxygen-terminated FeO(111) film.
Background	The stacking sequence of the FeO bilayers is not unambiguously clear on Ru(0001), but very likely, these films are oxygen-terminated as discussed in .ref. 29
Method	This gave us the idea to use an FeO(111) precovered metal substrate as a substrate system for the growth of materials which are difficult to grow epitaxially in single-crystalline quality.
Conclusion	The new, ordered LEED structure may then be attributed to an ordered Ru/ZrOx interface structure as has been proposed to occur for zirconia films on Pt(111) after annealing beyond 1100 K.18
Method	Therefore, we have grown zirconia films on FeO(111) precovered Ru(0001).
Method	It was not tried to obtain STM images.
Observation	This film with a lattice constant of 3.08 Å wets the Ru(0001) substrate (except for some cracks and vacancy islands, Fig. 2b).
Background	Alternatively, a suitable interface layer (or ‘interfactant’) between the substrate and the growing film may act as a diffusion barrier and may relieve misfit stress.23,24
Conclusion	It presents an explanation for the unexpected wetting behavior on top of the polar FeO(111) interface layer.
Result	LEED spots are much sharper than the broad spots reported in previous studies18–20 indicating much better long-range order.
Method	Also on Pt(111), the FeO(111) lattice constant is expanded to values between 3.09 to ∼3.40 Å (depending on the coverage),35 and such a lattice constant expansion very likely applies to other metal substrates.
Result	A (2 × 2) structure with respect to the Ru(0001) substrate from O/Ru(0001) is observed, and additionally a new hexagonal pattern with a lattice constant of about 6.9 Å occurs.
Background	Fibre-matrix composites, sensor technology, light bulbs, and medical implants depend on the interaction at a metal-ceramic interface.
Method	Both studies showed broad (2 × 2) LEED reflexes of defective, cubic zirconia with limited long-range order.

Model	The active space in the CASSCF calculations included 16 electrons distributed over 13 orbitals, i.e., this was the full-valence active space excluding 2s lone pairs on three oxygen atoms.
Object	We investigated the synthetic routes to form the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer, CO3(X 1A1), in carbon-dioxide-rich extraterrestrial ices and in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars experimentally and theoretically.
Background	Detailed photochemical models suggest that the oxygen atoms rather react to molecular oxygen and ultimately to ozone.5
Experiment	This setup consists of a 15 l cylindrical stainless steel chamber of 250 mm diameter and 300 mm height which can be evacuated down to 2 × 10−10 torr by a magnetically suspended turbopump backed by an oil-free scroll pump.
Motivation	Also, the explicit structure and the actual formation mechanism of the CO3 isomer and its role in the 18O isotopic enrichment in stratospheric carbon dioxide remain to be solved.
Method	It is interesting to correlate the infrared observations with a mass spectrometric analysis of the gas phase.
Method	Hereafter, the temporal developments of these absorptions upon electron irradiation are investigated quantitatively as outlined in Section 3.
Result	Statistically, each electron generates 15 ± 3 O3 molecules in the sample.
Model	The geometries of various local minima and transition states on three potential energy surfaces (PESs) of carbon trioxide, CO3, including the lowest triplet and two lowest singlet electronic states, have been optimized using the multireference complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method26,27 with the 6-311G(d) basis set.
Conclusion	These data make it exceptionally clear that the observed carbon trioxide molecule has a cyclic, C2v symmetric structure.
Result	Accounting for the electron current, this yields k1 = 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−17 and k2 = 3.9 ± 0.2 × 10−16.
Background	Carbon dioxide, CO2(X 1Σ+g), presents the major constituent (95.3% by volume); nitrogen (2.7%), argon (1.6%), carbon monoxide (0.7%), molecular oxygen (0.13%), water (150–200 ppm), and ozone (0.03 ppm) make up the rest.9
Model	All calculations were carried out using the MOLPRO 200230 and DALTON31 programs.
Conclusion	The spectroscopic data suggest that the remaining oxygen atoms rather react via molecular oxygen to form ozone via eqns. (12)–(13).
Conclusion	This process could contribute significantly to an 18O enrichment in carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars.
Background	This finding correlates also with a theoretical investigation of the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces of the CO3 system.19
Observation	Finally, we detected also a transition at 1879 cm−1, which was assigned tentatively as a Fermi resonance of the 2044 cm−1 band with an overtone of the 973 cm−1 fundamental.
Background	In extraterrestrial ices, the species do not react solely with the carbon dioxide ice, but with the remaining ice components.
Result	To interpret the discrepancy between the infrared and mass spectrometric data, we have to keep in mind that the silver target (first stage) is annealed while the cold head is still in operation; this means that the outer aluminum cold shield, which is mounted to the second stage of the closed cycle helium refrigerator, is still cooled down.
Method	Carbon dioxide ices were deposited at 10 K onto a silver (111) single crystal and irradiated with 5 keV electrons.
Background	Therefore, pristine ice mantles are processed chemically by the cosmic ray induced internal ultraviolet radiation present even in the deep interior of dense clouds (ϕ = 103 photons cm−2 s−1) and in particular through particles of the galactic cosmic radiation field.
Experiment	During the actual gas condensation, the deposition system can be moved 5 mm in front of the silver target.
Conclusion	Depending on the energy transfer form the impinging electron to the carbon dioxide molecule, the oxygen atom can be generated either in its electronic ground (3P) via inter system crossing to the triplet manifold and/or excited state (1D) on the singlet surface.
Observation	Besides the carbon monoxide and the carbon trioxide molecules, we were also able to identify the ozone molecule (Fig. 7).
Result	A similar pattern has been observed for the carbon dioxide molecule, too.
Result	The calculations suggest that the reactants first form a weakly bound complex (∼2.9 kJ mol−1) s5, which then rearranges to s1 with a barrier vias-TS2 of 5.6–7.6 kJ mol−1 relative to O(1D) + CO2.
Result	Once the heat load from the cartridge heater increase also the temperature of the second cold head stage, those molecules condensed on the aluminum shield can sublime, too (second ozone peak).
Result	Including the enhanced ozone column density in the oxygen balance gives a column density of generated oxygen atoms of 4.0 ± 0.6 × 1016 cm−2versus destruction of the carbon dioxide molecules of 3.0 ± 0.8 × 1016 cm−2.
Experiment	The latter is sampled via a Nicolet 510 DX FTIR spectrometer (6000–500 cm−1) operating in an absorption–reflection–absorption mode (reflection angle α = 75°; Fig. 2); spectra were accumulated for 2.5 min at a resolution of 2 cm−1.
Result	We were able to fit the temporal development of the column density assuming that a carbon dioxide dimer decomposed to carbon dioxide, atomic oxygen, and carbon monoxide; within the matrix cage, the generated oxygen atom reacts with the non-reacted carbon dioxide to form carbon trioxide via eqns. (9) and (10): −d[(CO2)2]/dt = k3Ie[(CO2)2] = k′3[(CO2)2],d[CO]/dt = k4Ie[(CO2)2] = k′4[(CO2)2].This leads to the temporal evolution of the column density for carbon trioxide via eqn. (11):[CO3](t) = b(1 − e−k′4t).Fig. 15 depicts the best fit of the carbon trioxide profile respectively, with b = 1.5 ± 0.3 × 1015 cm−2, and k′4 = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1.
Conclusion	In the solid matrix, however, the energy of MSX is likely lowered; the exact barrier height is currently under investigation.
Result	The cyclic structure s1 can be produced in a reaction between O(1D) and CO2(X 1Σ+g).
Result	This suggests that at least 1.1 ± 0.3 × 1016 cm−2 of the oxygen atoms exist in the form of molecular or atomic oxygen.
Result	The calculated symmetry of the carbon trioxide modes (Table 3) confirm this tentative assignment.
Background	Also, the interaction of carbon dioxide ices on Mars (and in comets as well as in the interstellar medium) with MeV particles produces significant amounts of ozone.
Result	On the other hand, the decay profile of the carbon dioxide absorptions suggest that 3.0 ± 0.8 × 1016 CO2 cm−2 have been destroyed after the irradiation.
Observation	The position of all peaks is in excellent agreement with earlier matrix isolation studies (Section 1) and with our calculated, scaled frequencies (Table 3).
Result	Non-reactive O(1D) can be quenched in the matrix easily via intersystem crossing to the 3P ground state.38
Result	The potential energy surface (Fig. 4) helps to understand this scenario.
Method	Briefly, m/z ratios are chosen to result in an inhomogeneous system of linear equations including the measured ion current (right hand vector), partial pressures (unknown quantity), and calibration factors of fragments of individual gaseous species determined in separate experiments.
Motivation	Note that these studies also have important implications to planetary, cometary, and interstellar chemistry since carbon dioxide has been identified as a major component of ices on Mars, in comets such as Halley,24 and of low temperature grain mantles in cold molecular clouds like the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC-1)25.
Result	Note that the ozone column density increases upon warming the sample due to reactions of atomic oxygen with molecular oxygen (section 4.2); at 60 K (240 min experimental time), the ozone column density decreases, too.
Result	Therefore, the molecules subliming during the annealing phase of the silver target (first ozone peak) can actually re-condense onto the aluminum cold shield.
Result	Since the formation of a single ozone molecule requires the destruction of three carbon dioxide molecules to initiate three oxygen atoms, 45 ± 9 carbon dioxide molecules have to be destroyed to account for the experimentally derived ozone production rate.
Method	The raw data, i.e. the temporal development of the ion currents of distinct mass-to-charge ratios, are processed via matrix interval algebra to compute absolute partial pressures of the gas phase molecules.33
Result	Our calculations show that in the gas phase, only the addition of O(1D) can form s1vias5 and s-TS3.
Conclusion	Note that only ground state reactants have been considered; this is certainly true for the reaction during the equilibrating phase at 10 K and the annealing program to 60 K. However, during the electron bombardment, O(1D) atoms could react, too.
Conclusion	This process might be of fundamental importance to account for an 18O enrichment in carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars.
Result	Our calculations suggest that two minima exist on the lowest singlet CO3 potential energy surface (PES): a C2v-symmetric three-member cyclic structure s1 and a D3h-symmetric isomer s2 (Fig. 4). s1 and s2 have similar energies and reside 197.5 and 197.1 kJ mol−1 lower than the O(1D) + CO2(X 1Σ+g) asymptote, respectively.
Result	Both reactions are exoergic by 498.5 kJ mol−1 and 106.5 kJ mol−1, respectively and involve no entrance barrier except the diffusion energy of the oxygen atoms to migrate to the reaction site.
Method	Since all quantities are provided with experimental errors, matrix interval arithmetic, i.e. an IBM high accuracy arithmetic subroutine defining experimental uncertainties as intervals, is incorporated in the computations to extract individual, calibrated components of gas mixtures.
Result	Our experiments indicate that each electron initiates 60 ± 6 CO molecules within the carbon dioxide ice (Table 5); this translates to 331 ± 33 eV and 455 ± 46 eV to form O(3P) and O(1D), respectively.
Background	A D3h structure was identified as a local minimum, too, but lies 16.8 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than the cyclic isomer (Fig. 1, (3)); according to calculations, both structures are connected via a transition state located 36 kJ mol−1 above the cyclic molecule.20
Result	On the triplet surface, ground state oxygen atoms can react solely to yield t1; followed by intersystem crossing, the latter can form s2 in the carbon dioxide matrix.
Result	However, the mass spectrometric results do not correlate entirely with the infrared data.
Conclusion	Since the addition of O(1D) involves a barrier of 5.6–7.6 kJ mol−1 and the reaction of O(3P) with carbon dioxide to form the carbon trioxide molecule via triplet-singlet intersystem crossing is endoergic by 2 kJ mol−1, the atomic oxygen reactant(s) must have also access kinetic energy.
Observation	With decreasing carbon dioxide column density, new absorptions arise from carbon monoxide (Fig. 9) and carbon trioxide (Fig. 10).
Result	About 2% of the oxygen atoms react with carbon dioxide molecules to form the C2v symmetric, cyclic CO3 structure via addition to the carbon–oxygen double bond of the carbon dioxide species; neither the Cs nor the D3h symmetric isomers of carbon trioxide were detected.
Result	Finally, we would like to comment on the possibility to generate reactive carbon atoms via the interaction of energetic electrons with carbon dioxide.
Object	In this paper, we present a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation on the formation mechanism of carbon trioxide in low temperature carbon dioxide ices and the implications for gas phase chemistry.
Conclusion	This is a clear indication that the interaction of energetic electrons with the carbon dioxide molecules generates reactive oxygen atoms.
Conclusion	In the gas phase, however, the initially formed C2v structure can ring-open to the D3h isomer which in turn loses an oxygen atom to ‘recycle’ carbon dioxide.
Result	Here, solid mixtures containing H2O (100), CO (7–27), CH3OH (<3.4), NH3 (<6), CH4 (<2), and CO2 (15) were identified unambiguously via infrared spectroscopy towards the dense cloud TMC-1 employing the field star Elias 16 as a black body source;42 the numbers in parentheses indicate the relative abundances compared to water ice.
Observation	Note that although the unobserved ν3 and ν4 modes have larger absorption coefficients than the detected ν6 transition, the ν4 absorption overlaps with the broad ν2 band of the carbon dioxide reactant; the ν3 band of carbon trioxide is too close to the cut-off of the MCTB detector to be observable.
Method	I() = I0()e−ε()nwith the intensity of the IR beam after, I(), and before absorption, I0(), at a wavenumber , the wavenumber dependent absorption coefficient ε() in units of cm−2 and the number of absorbing species per cm2, n.
Result	Extrapolating eqns. (8) and (11) for t → ∞ and extracting the ratio of [CO](t = ∞)/[CO3](t = ∞) calculates the fraction of released oxygen atoms reacting with carbon dioxide to 47 ± 14.
Conclusion	In the gas phase, this crossing is located close to t-TS1, and O(3P) with a sufficient amount of kinetic energy can surpass this barrier to form also s1.
Result	The integrated absorption features, the corresponding integral absorption coefficients, and the column densities are summarized in Table 2.
Observation	A comparison of the pristine sample (Fig. 3) with the irradiated ice at 10 K clearly shows new absorption features of carbon monoxide at 2139 cm−1 (ν1(CO stretching); Fig. 5; Table 4)) and the corresponding isotopic pattern of 13CO at 2092 cm−1.
Experiment	These ices were irradiated isothermally at 10 K with electrons of 5 keV kinetic energy generated in an electron gun at beam currents of 100 nA (60 min) by scanning the electron beam over an area of 3.0 ± 0.4 cm2.
Conclusion	Based on these considerations, we can conclude that the cyclic carbon trioxide molecule should also be present in carbon-dioxide-rich extraterrestrial ices which have been identified in interstellar clouds, comets, and also on Mars.
Conclusion	It is not surprising that we were unable to detect these transitions in our experiments.
Background	Various kinetic measurements have been carried out to determine the temperature-dependent rate constants of the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms, O(1D), with carbon dioxide.
Background	Once O(3P) and carbon monoxide has been formed, it is difficult to restore carbon dioxide, since the reversed reaction is spin forbidden.
Result	C(3P) + O(3P) → CO(X 1Σ+).Detailed electronic structure calculations depicted that a release of carbon atoms from a linear carbon dioxide molecule does not occur.39
Result	This means that only 2.1 ± 0.5% of the generated oxygen atoms react to carbon trioxide.
Result	Hence, the total oxygen column density of the freshly formed molecules calculates as the sum of the carbon trioxide column density plus three times the ozone column density; based on these considerations, a column density of 2.9 ± 0.4 × 1016 cm−2 has to be generated in the carbon dioxide ice by the electrons.
Result	Here, carbon monoxide does not re-condense at the 50 K aluminum cold shield since carbon monoxide ice is unstable at temperatures higher than 30 K.
Method	The experiment was monitored via a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in absorption-reflection-absorption (solid state) and through a quadruple mass spectrometer (gas phase) on-line and in situ.
Background	Near the threshold, only ground state O(3P) atoms are produced; shorter wavelengths supply also O(1D).5
Observation	It is interesting to compare this temperature with those where the bands of carbon monoxide 91 K, carbon trioxide 91 K, and carbon dioxide 94 K vanish.
Conclusion	In the gas phase, however, the initially formed C2v structure is rovibrationally excited and can ring-open to the D3h isomer which in turn rearranges back to the C2v structure and then loses an oxygen atom to ‘recycle’ carbon dioxide.
Result	Here, K(10 K) = 0.002176482 means that at 10 K the concentration of s1 should be 500 times higher than that of s2, if they are in equilibrium.
Background	Carbon dioxide ice presents also a major constituent of ices as condensed on sub-micrometre sized grain particles in cold interstellar clouds.
Result	After the irradiation, the carbon dioxide matrix still stores ground state oxygen atoms; these species diffuse even at 10 K and form additional ozone molecules.
Background	Potential organics inside the Martian soil might be degraded easily by energetic oxygen atoms.
Experiment	To guarantee an identification of the reaction products in the ices and those subliming into the gas phase on line and in situ, two detection schemes are incorporated: (i) a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and (ii) a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS).
Method	The FTIR spectra are analyzed in three steps.
Background	Although the dust component embodies only 1% of the interstellar matter, these nuclei play a key role in the formation of new molecules.
Conclusion	In the solid state, CO3(X 1A1) is being stabilized by phonon interactions.
Observation	On the other hand, the carbon trioxide column density rises quickly but starts to saturate toward the end of the experiment at 1.8 × 1015 cm−2 (2044 cm−1), 1.5 × 1015 cm−2 (1067 cm−1), and 1.1 × 1015 cm−2 (972 cm−1).
Experiment	This crystal is cooled to 10.4 ± 0.3 K, serves as a substrate for the ice condensate, and conducts the heat generated from the impinging electrons to the cold head.
Observation	With increasing temperature the CO2 molecules sublime; as the temperature is raised from 10 K to 20 K, strengths of all carbon dioxide absorptions start to diminish; at 94 K, no solid carbon dioxide is left on the silver waver.
Method	Upon completion of the electron bombardment, the samples were kept at 10 K and were then annealed to 293 K to release the reactants and newly formed molecules into the gas phase.
Background	At room temperature, rate constants of a few 10−10 cm3 s−1 have been derived.15–17
Result	However, this reaction has to pass s-TS3 which is located 5.6–7.6 kJ mol−1 above the separated reactants.
Result	Accounting for the electron current, this yields k4 = 2.2 ± 0.2 × 10−15.
Observation	Upon heating the sample to 25 K (180 min experimental time), the carbon dioxide matrix start to sublime (Fig. 8); similarly, the embedded carbon monoxide molecules are being released into the gas phase (Fig. 9).
Result	In the reverse direction, the barrier for the O(3P) + CO2(X 1Σ+g) → t1 reaction is calculated to be as high as 147.7 kJ mol−1.
Background	Further theoretical calculations indicated that the CO3 isomer identified in the carbon dioxide and argon matrices might be the C2v symmetric bridged molecule.
Result	The cyclic isomer ring opens and forms a linear COO(X 1Σ+) molecule which then loses a carbon atom in its excited 1D state.
Background	These molecular clouds are interspersed with ultraviolet photons (<13.2 eV) and energetic particles from T-Tauri winds, stellar jets, carbon stars, and galactic cosmic ray particles.
Conclusion	About 2% of the oxygen atoms react with carbon dioxide molecules to form the C2v symmetric, cyclic CO3 structure, via addition to the carbon–oxygen double bond of the carbon dioxide species; neither the Cs nor the D3h symmetric isomers of carbon trioxide were detected.
Result	Recall that the slight increase of the carbon monoxide column density in the equilibration phase (Fig. 9) could indicate a recombination of diffusive carbon atoms with mobile oxygen atoms, eqn. (14), a process similar to the formation of molecular oxygen according to eqn. (12).
Result	Considering a density of 1.7 g cm−3 at 10 K,32 this translates into an averaged target thickness of 0.48 ± 0.11 μm.
Method	Therefore, we must perform the raw data processing via matrix interval algebra to calculate the actual partial pressures of the molecules in the gas phase.
Result	For instance, s3 (C2v, 1A2) is a complex of O(1D) with carbon dioxide and stabilized by 27.6 kJ mol−1 relative to the separated species.
Background	On the other hand, a CO(X 1Σ+) + O2(X 3Σ−g) exit channel was found to have an activation energy between 15 and 28 kJ mol−1 in the range of 300–2500 K.18
Result	This in turn indicates that the 5 keV electrons are absorbed and induce radiation damage within the first 0.28 ± 0.09 μm of the carbon dioxide sample.
Conclusion	The detailed formation mechanism of ozone via eqn. (13) and/or electronically excited species is currently under investigation and might involve a short-lived cyclic ozone molecule.
Conclusion	A simple exponential fit fails as expected since the ozone is clearly a higher-order reaction product.
Result	Our investigations indicate that the interaction of an electron with a carbon dioxide molecule is dictated by a carbon–oxygen bond cleavage to form electronically excited (1D) and/or ground state (3P) oxygen atoms plus a carbon monoxide molecule.
Result	Interestingly, we were able to locate a minimal energy crossing point (MSX) between the lowest triplet and singlet electronic states in a close vicinity of t-TS1, both the geometry and energy of MSX are similar to those for the triplet transition state.
Conclusion	In our matrix, CO3(X 1A1) is being stabilized by phonon interactions to the surrounding matrix.
Observation	At 92 K, the ozone absorption disappears completely.
Background	Once molecules, radicals, or atoms from the gas phase collide with the solid particle, they are accreted on the grain surface resulting in an icy mantle up to 0.1 μm thick.
Object	Finally, important implications of these results to planetary and atmospheric chemistry are addressed.
Background	Absorptions at 1894 cm−1 (argon matrix) and 1880 cm−1 (carbon dioxide matrix) were tentatively assigned as a Fermi resonance of the 2045 cm−1 band with an overtone of the 972 cm−1 fundamental.
Object	The formation of the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer, CO3(X 1A1), in carbon-dioxide-rich extraterrestrial ices and in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars were investigated experimentally and theoretically.
Background	This can lead to the formation of new molecules in the solid state via non-equilibrium (non-thermal) chemistry even at temperatures as low as 10 K. The particle component of the cosmic ray radiation field consists of 97–98% protons (p, H+) and 2–3% helium nuclei (α-particles, He2+) in the low energy range of 1–10 MeV (1 MeV = 106 eV) with ϕ = 10 particles cm−2 s−1.43
Motivation	However, these processes have not been investigated in the laboratory so far.
Conclusion	Our data indicate that the carbon trioxide molecule is formed via reaction of atomic oxygen with carbon dioxide.
Result	These data translate to a synthesis of 2.5 ± 0.5 carbon trioxide molecules per electron (0.8 ± 0.2 CO3 cm−2 per electron; production rates are averaged over those obtained from three CO3 fundamentals).
Motivation	Despite this information on the reaction of carbon dioxide with atomic oxygen, an incorporation of these data into homogeneous gas phase models still fails to reproduce the observed abundances of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and ozone in the Martian atmosphere quantitatively.9
Observation	This effect is even more pronounced while the sample is heated to 60 K. Here, the ozone column density rises significantly by about 30% reaching a maximum at 1.3 ± 0.2 × 1016 cm−2 before the column density drops sharply due to the subliming carbon dioxide matrix.
Observation	During the annealing phase of the sample, the carbon dioxide matrix and the newly formed molecules (CO3, CO, O3) sublime into the gas phase.
Observation	As expected, the carbon dioxide column density stays constant during the isothermal phase.
Motivation	Atreya et al. pointed out the necessity to include heterogeneous reactions on aerosols or carbon dioxide ice particles in the Martian air.21–23
Observation	Two absorptions at 1042 cm−1 (ν3, anti symmetric stretch) and the weaker bending mode at 704 cm−1 (ν2) were identified.
Conclusion	Considering the energy of the electron of 5 keV, about 10% of its kinetic energy is utilized to cleave the carbon–oxygen bonds of the carbon dioxide molecules; note that this calculation assumes all the carbon monoxide molecules are formed in their vibrational ground states; also, the oxygen atoms have no excess translational energy.
Conclusion	During the isothermal phase, the ozone column density slightly increases from 9.3 ± 1.3 × 1015 cm−2 to 1.0 ± 0.1 × 1016 cm−2 during the 10 K equilibration period; this suggest that oxygen atoms, which are mobile at 10 K, are present in the carbon dioxide matrix and may react with molecular oxygen to form additional ozone.
Observation	Note that whereas the carbon monoxide column density stays constant during the isothermal phase at 10 K, the carbon trioxide column density seems to decrease slightly by 5%.
Conclusion	O(3P) + O(3P) → O2(X 3Σ−g),O2(X 3Σ−g) + O(3P) → O3(X 1A1).
Conclusion	So far, we were not able to fit the temporal evolution of the ozone column density; this fit requires knowledge of the diffusion coefficient of the oxygen atom which is currently under study.
Observation	Fig. 3 depicts a typical infrared spectrum of the frost; the absorptions are compiled in Table 1.
Result	A second reaction pathway of the oxygen atoms involves the formation of ozone via molecular oxygen.
Result	These reactions are endoergic by 532 kJ mol−1 (5.51 eV) and 732 kJ mol−1 (7.59 eV), respectively.
Conclusion	Based on our integration routine, 3.0 ± 0.8 × 1016 CO2 cm−2 lead to the formation of 3.5 ± 0.4 × 1016 CO cm−2 and 1.5 ± 0.3 × 1015 CO3 cm−2, i.e. destruction of 3.0 ± 0.8 × 1016 cm−2versus formation of 3.7 ± 0.4 × 1016 cm−2; within the error limits, we can conclude that the carbon budget is conserved in the experiment.
Result	These data suggest a column density of (1.1 ± 0.3) × 1018 molecules cm−2.
Result	Since each carbon dioxide molecule fragments to carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen upon interaction with an electron, we would expect an identical number of oxygen atoms to be incorporated inside the newly formed molecules, i.e. ozone and carbon trioxide.
Conclusion	Instead, we located the seam of crossing (MSX) which connects the triplet to the singlet surface.
Result	The structure of s4 (Cs, 1A″) is similar to that of s2, however, all three C–O bonds and OCO angles are slightly unequal.
Result	Considering an initial column density of 1.188 × 1018 cm−2 CO2 cm−2 (0.48 ± 0.11 μm CO2 ice), we can conclude that the newly synthesized molecules are formed within the first 0.28 ± 0.09 μm of the sample, i.e. those layers which are subliming first into the vacuum.
Model	Single-point energies for various species have been subsequently refined employing internally-contracted multireference configuration interaction MRCI method28,29 with the same (16,13) active space and the larger 6-311+G(3df) basis set.
Background	However, the explicit structure of the CO3 intermediate has not been unraveled yet.
Observation	During the irradiation of the carbon dioxide ice, the column density of the CO2 molecules decreases only slightly from 1.188 × 1018 cm−2 to 1.158 × 1018 cm−2 (Fig. 8); note that these data are afflicted with an error of ±25% (Table 2).
Model	The carbon monoxide molecule was assumed to ‘decay’ first order upon electron bombardment similar to a radioactive decay, i.e. it follows the velocity law (5) (the square brackets indicate the column density in cm−2; Ie = 4.92 × 1011 s−1 presents the electron current in electrons s−1): −d[CO2]/dt = k1Ie[CO2] = k′1[CO2],d[CO]/dt = k2Ie[CO2] = k′2[CO2].This translates to the following temporal evolutions of the column density for carbon dioxide (7) and carbon monoxide (8) with the constant a: [CO2](t) = [CO2](t = 0)ek′1t,[CO](t) = a(1 − e−k′2t).The best fits of the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide profiles are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively, with [CO2](t = 0) = 1.19 ± 0.30 × 1018 cm−2, k′1 = 7.35 ± 0.20 × 10−6 s−1, a = 7.1 ± 0.7 × 1016 cm−2, and k′2 = 1.93 ± 0.1 × 10−4 s−1.
Experiment	The ice condensation is assisted by a precision leak valve.
Conclusion	Within the error limits, the oxygen balance seems to hold.
Result	This requires a destruction of 2.8 ± 0.4 × 1016 CO2 cm−2.
Observation	We were also able to detect four fundamentals of the C2v symmetric, cyclic CO3 structure at 2045 cm−1 (ν1), 1068 cm−1 (ν2), 973 cm−1 (ν5), and 565 cm−1 (ν6) (Fig. 6).
Result	Since the carbon dioxide matrix sublimes in layers, those layers exposed to the vacuum sublime first.
Background	Most important, these sub micrometer sized particles present valuable nurseries to synthesize new molecules.
Experiment	To minimize the radiative heat transfer from the chamber walls to the target, a 40 K aluminum radiation shield is connected to the second stage of the cold head and surrounds the crystal.
Method	The integration routine of the absorption features is accurate to ±10%.34
Experiment	The chemical modification of the ice targets is monitored during the experiments to extract time-dependent concentration profiles and hence production rates of newly formed molecules and radicals in the solid state.
Background	In particular the O(1D) atoms are very reactive and may destroy newly formed, astrobiologically important molecules such as sugars and amino acids even deep inside ices.
Observation	Figs. 8–11 compile the temporal development of the column densities of the carbon dioxide reactant and of the products (carbon monoxide, carbon trioxide, and ozone) during the irradiation at 10 K, the consecutive equilibration period at 10 K, and the heating phase.
Result	Transition state s-TS2 separating s3 and s4 lies 46.4 and 159.8 kJ mol−1 above O(1D) + CO2(X 1Σ+g) and s4, respectively.
Experiment	The carbon dioxide ices were prepared at 10 K by depositing carbon dioxide gas onto the cooled silver crystal.
Background	The interest in the carbon trioxide molecule has been also fueled by the complex reaction mechanisms of carbon oxides (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) with atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere.5–8
Result	These two singlet isomers can rearrange to each other by ring opening/ring closure and are separated by a low barrier of 18.4 kJ mol−1 with respect to s1 occurring at transition state s-TS1.
Conclusion	The studies indicate that the interaction of an electron with a carbon dioxide molecule is dictated by a carbon–oxygen bond cleavage to form ground state (3P) and/or electronically excited (1D) oxygen atoms plus a carbon monoxide molecule.
Method	First, we investigate the new absorptions qualitatively and assign their carriers.
Goal	Untangling the formation of the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer in low temperature carbon dioxide ices
Observation	As indicated in the previous section, carbon monoxide, carbon trioxide, and the oxygen atoms are formed initially in the first 0.28 ± 0.09 μm of the carbon dioxide sample.
Experiment	This setup guarantees a reproducible thickness and composition of the frosts.
Method	Based on these information, we can now investigate the carbon balance of the target.
Conclusion	However, since only the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer was detected, this pathway can be likely ruled out.
Observation	The effects of the electron irradiation of the carbon dioxide target are displayed in Figs. 5–11.
Result	The ozone column density increases after 60 min irradiation time to 9.3 ± 1.3 × 1015 cm−2; data has been calculated with an integral absorption coefficient of 1.4 ± 0.2 × 10−17 molecules cm−1.
Background	This order of magnitude suggest that the reaction has no or only little activation energy, proceeds with almost unit efficiency, and most likely involves a reaction intermediate.
Background	At ultralow temperatures, all species except H, H2, and He hold sticking coefficients of unity.
Result	This requires that the O(1D) reactant has at least 5.6–7.6 kJ mol−1 excess kinetic energy to overcome the barrier.
Experiment	The experiments were carried out in a contamination-free ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber; the top view of this machine is shown in Fig. 2.
Conclusion	Summarized, our investigations show that the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer, CO3(X 1A1), can be formed in low temperature carbon dioxide matrix via addition of suprathermal oxygen atoms to carbon dioxide.
Conclusion	Therefore, we can conclude that molecular oxygen and oxygen atoms reside inside the carbon dioxide matrix as well.
Result	Detailed dynamics simulation showed that 99.9% of the transferred energy leads predominantly to ionization and hence release of energetic (keV) electrons perpendicularly to the trajectory of the MeV implant (ultra track).
Experiment	Blank checks of the pure gas (BOC Gases, 99.999%) via a quadrupole mass spectrometer and of the frosts via a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer were also carried out.
Conclusion	Whereas the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer is being stabilized upon reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms with carbon dioxide in the matrix via phonon interaction, in the gas phase the cyclic carbon trioxide molecule can isomerizes to the D3h isomer.
Conclusion	We have to keep in mind that this analysis only comprises the oxygen balance of the infrared active molecules, but not of infrared inactive species such as molecular and atomic oxygen.
Conclusion	Therefore, our experiments simulate also the energetic processes in the ultra track of MeV particles inside interstellar and also cometary ices.
Background	At temperatures higher than 100 K, the cyclic CO3 isomer was predicted to decay to carbon dioxide and ground state oxygen atoms via singlet-triplet transitions.
Result	Instead, the linear carbon dioxide species has to isomerize first to a cyclic structure which lies 582 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than the linear structure.
Background	Jacox et al. conducted also a normal coordinate analysis and suggested a C2v bridged structure (Fig. 1(1)); in strong contrast, LaBonville et al. allocated a Cs symmetric structure of the carbon trioxide molecule (Fig. 1(2)).4
Conclusion	This could scramble the incorporated 18O and hence lead to an enrichment of 18O within the carbon dioxide once the carbon trioxide molecule decomposes too atomic oxygen and carbon dioxide (Fig. 16).
Background	Deep in the interior of dense clouds, grain particles effectively shield newly synthesized molecules in the gas phase from the destructive external UV radiation field.
Observation	Compared to the carbon oxides, the temporal development of ozone depicts striking differences (Fig. 11).
Conclusion	The atomic oxygen exchange pathway has been confirmed in a recent crossed molecular beams experiment; however, the authors were not able to assign the nature if the CO3 intermediate explicitly.45
Background	In the gas phase, the latter was postulated to fragment to carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen, possibly inducing an isotopic enrichment in carbon dioxide via isotopic scrambling.14
Experiment	A two stage closed cycle helium refrigerator-interfaced to a differentially pumped rotary feedthrough is attached to the lid of the machine and holds a polished silver (111) single crystal.
Model	Vibrational frequencies and infrared (IR) intensities have been also computed at the CASSCF(16,13)/6-311G(d) level of theory.
Result	However, since the integration is accurate only to 10%, the drop of the 2044 cm−1 absorption might be within the experimental error limits: similar the increasing carbon monoxide column density upon warming the matrix to 20 K; alternatively we might conclude that the carbon trioxide molecule starts to decompose even at 10 K. Upon heating the target, both the carbon monoxide and carbon trioxide column densities decrease.
Result	What might be the reason for the low fraction of oxygen atoms reacting to carbon dioxide?
Conclusion	CO2(X 1Σ+g) → CO(X 1Σ+) + O(3P),CO2(X 1Σ+g) → CO(X 1Σ+) + O(1D).
Method	Reformulating eqn. (1) with A() = lg(I0()/I()) gives A() = ε()n/ln 10.Integrating from 1 to 2 yields with the integrated absorption 1∫2A()d in cm−1 and the integral absorption coefficient Aexp = 1∫2ε()d in cm.
Result	In addition, we found two local minima on PES of the first excited singlet electronic state, which have lower energies than O(1D) + CO2(X 1Σ+g).
Result	Note that two peaks were observed only for ozone, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, but not for carbon monoxide.
Method	Since, for example, carbon dioxide can fragment to molecular oxygen and also to carbon monoxide in the ionizer of the quadrupole mass spectrometer, different molecular species add to one mass to charge ratio (m/z) of, e.g. 32 (O2).
Experiment	To allow a selection of the target temperature, a temperature sensor, cartridge heater, and a programmable controller are interfaced to the target.
Result	However, our experiments identify neither the cyclic carbon dioxide nor the linear COO(X 1Σ+) molecule as a reactive intermediate in our matrix.
Method	We would like to stress that the integrated absorption coefficients have been taken in transmission experiments,47 but the experiment has been carried out in an absorption–reflection–absorption mode.
Result	These data agree very well with previous assignments36.
Experiment	The infrared beam is coupled via a mirror flipper outside the spectrometer, passes through a differentially pumped potassium bromide (KBr) window, is attenuated in the ice sample prior and after reflection at a polished silver waver, and exits the main chamber through a second differentially pumped KBr window before being monitored via a liquid nitrogen cooled detector (MCTB).
Result	Since the addition of O(1D) involves a barrier of a 4–8 kJ mol−1 and the reaction of O(3P) with carbon dioxide to form the carbon trioxide molecule via triplet-singlet intersystem crossing is endoergic by 2 kJ mol−1, the oxygen reactant(s) must have excess kinetic energy (suprathermal oxygen atoms which are not in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding 10 K matrix).
Background	Upon warming the ices, molecules would sublime and could contribute considerably to the ozone budget in the Martian atmosphere.
Experiment	Higher beam currents, which increase the temperature of the frost surface, should be avoided.
Conclusion	Our investigations indicate that the response of the carbon dioxide system upon the keV electron bombardment is governed by an initial formation of carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen, eqns. (3)–(4).
Result	Since the ν5 at 973 cm−1 has b1 symmetry, the overtone (2ν5) holds an a1 symmetry (b1 ⊗ b1 = a1), the latter has the same symmetry as the ν1 fundamental; this can give rise to the Fermi resonance as observed at 1879 cm−1.
Result	These data are in close agreement to matrix isolation studies of the carbon monoxide molecule.35
Method	The factor cos(75°) accounts for angle between the surface normal of the silver wafer and the infrared beam, whereas the division by two corrects for the ingoing and outgoing IR beams.
Conclusion	This strongly correlates with our experimental findings that carbon dioxide and carbon trioxide are the only newly formed carbon-bearing species in our experiment.
Experiment	The gas phase is monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzer QMG 420) with electron impact ionization at 90 eV electron energy of the neutral molecules in the residual gas analyzer mode.
Observation	Neither the Cs nor the D3h symmetric structures of carbon trioxide were observed.
Background	This means that each collision of a gas phase species with a cold surface leads to an absorption and hence thickening of the ice layer.
Result	The ability of the oxygen atoms to diffuse even at 10 K and in particular at elevated temperatures has been established previously (section 4.2. and Fig. 11).
Observation	The carbon monoxide column density rises almost linearly with increasing irradiation time to 3.5 ± 0.4 × 1016 cm−2, i.e. an average production rate of 60 ± 6 carbon monoxide molecules per implant, i.e. 20 ± 2 CO cm−2; the integral absorption coefficient for the 2139 cm−1 band of 1.1 × 10−17 molecules cm−1 is accurate to ±10%.
Background	On Earth, photolysis of stratospheric ozone generates O(1D), which in turn might react with carbon dioxide to form a carbon trioxide molecule.
Background	Moll et al1. and Jacox et al2. assigned four fundamentals at 2045 cm−1 (CO stretch), 1073 cm−1 (O–O stretch), 972 cm−1 (C–O stretch), 593 cm−1 (C–O stretch), and 568 cm−1 (O–CO stretch) in low temperature carbon dioxide matrices; in argon matrices, these absorptions were shifted to 2053 cm−1, 1070 cm−1, 975 cm−1, and 564 cm−1;3 no feature around 593 cm−1 was identified in solid argon.
Conclusion	Our investigations help to understand a potential 18O enrichment in the terrestrial and Martian atmospheres.
Result	Once s1 has been formed in the solid state, the surrounding matrix can divert the internal energy (197.5 kJ mol−1) of the carbon trioxide species; this stabilizes the latter and prevents an isomerization vias-TS1 to s2.
Background	Ever since the first tentative characterization of the carbon trioxide molecule in photolyzed ozone–carbon dioxide ices at 77 K,1 the CO3 species has been a subject of various spectroscopic and theoretical studies.
Result	As the temperature rises, oxygen atoms diffuse and could penetrate also those regions of the carbon dioxide ice which has not been penetrated by the electrons; here, the oxygen atoms could recombine to ozone.
Conclusion	Similarly, the electronically excited 1A″ surface can be excluded to contribute to the formation of the cyclic carbon trioxide isomer since only s4 can be formed vias3 and s-TS2.
Result	This means that only 3.01 × 1016 cm−2, i.e. 2.5%, of the carbon dioxide molecules are destroyed at the end of the irradiation (Table 5).
Experiment	Accounting for the extraction efficiency of 78.8% and the irradiation time, this exposes the target to 1.77 × 1015 electrons.
Conclusion	However, to escape the matrix cage, the oxygen atom must have at least 0.5 eV excess kinetic energy; if its kinetic energy is less than the lattice bonding energy, at least O(1D) can react back without an entrance barrier to recycle the carbon dioxide molecule.
Result	Isomer t1 can decompose to O(3P) + CO2 overcoming a barrier 51.5 kJ mol−1 at transition state t-TS1.
Method	Reactive oxygen atoms are generated via electronic energy loss of high energy electrons to the carbon dioxide molecule in the solid sample.
Result	Actually, the calculated equilibrium constants for the isomerization s2 ↔ s1 correlate with the failed observation of the D3h symmetric CO3 isomer in the ice matrix.
Result	Table 3 summarizes the infrared absorptions of s1, s2, and t2.
Background	However, neither reaction products nor the nature of the intermediate were determined.
Background	Froese and Goddard suggested that the barrier-less, spin-forbidden quenching pathway to form ground state oxygen atoms and carbon dioxide (ΔRG = −190.0 kJ mol−1) dominates over the formation of CO(X 1Σ+) plus O2(X 3Σ−g) (ΔRG = −157.5 kJ mol−1) and CO(X 1Σ+) plus O2(a 1Δg) (ΔRG = −63.3 kJ mol−1).
Result	In the triplet electronic state, separated O(3P) and CO2 have the lowest energy, while the C2v isomer t1 (3B2) resides 96.3 kJ mol−1 higher. t1 has a structure rather similar to that of s2, except that the three C–O bond lengths are not equal; there are one double (1.201 Å) and two single (1.343 Å) bonds.
Background	It has been suggested that the photodissciation of carbon dioxide by solar photons (λ < 2050 Å) produces carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen.
Model	To fit the experimentally obtained profile of the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide column densities, we employed the following model.
Conclusion	The remaining oxygen atoms react barrier-less to form ozone via molecular oxygen.
Result	Although the partial pressure of carbon monoxide begins to increase at 25 K (as expected from the infrared data), the temporal development of the partial pressure of ozone shows two distinct peaks: a small hump starting at 240 min experimental time (60 K), and a second intense peak at 291 min experimental time (Fig. 12).
Result	Another possible isomer of triplet CO3, Cs-symmetric OCOO t2 (3A″) is much less favorable and lies 260.7 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than O(3P) + CO2(X 1Σ+g).
Method	Finally, these data are fitted to calculate production rates of synthesized molecules in units of molecules cm−2 (column density), molecules per impinging electron, and absorbed electron volt (eV) per target molecule (dose).
Result	Once these layers have been released, the remaining carbon dioxide ice of 0.20 ± 0.04 μm does not contain any newly formed molecules.
Method	To determine the ice composition quantitatively, we integrated numerous absorption features and calculated the column density, i.e. the numbers of absorbing molecules per cm2, n, via the Lambert–Beer relationship (1) and eqns. (2)–(3).
Background	The primary fate of electronically excited oxygen atoms is thought to be quenching to form O(3P); the detailed process is not known and has been postulated to proceed via a carbon trioxide molecule.
Observation	Note, however, that whereas the carbon dioxide absorptions disappear at 94 K, no carbon monoxide and carbon trioxide bands were observed at temperatures higher than 91 K. At 91 K, a column density of 5.6 ± 1.2 × 1017 CO2 cm−2 remains (0.21 ± 0.04 μm CO2 ice).
Conclusion	Since the carbon budget is conserved in our experiment (section 4.2.2) we suggest that the contribution of reactive carbon atoms, if any, is only minor.
Goal	Our first goal is to identify the infrared absorption features of the carbon trioxide molecule, to resolve the true nature of the 1880 cm−1 absorption of the carbon trioxide molecule unambiguously, and to assign the structure of the newly formed species.
Result	To account for the total oxygen balance after the irradiation, we have to include the newly synthesized carbon trioxide molecules (1.5 ± 0.3 × 1015 cm−2), too.
Background	It has been well established that cosmic ray MeV particles penetrate the ice mantles and the grain core and deposit parts of their energy inside the ices via interaction of the MeV implant and the electronic system of the ice molecules.44
Conclusion	This could explain the presence of ozone absorptions at the temperature of 92 K where absorptions of carbon monoxide and carbon trioxide are absent due to their sublimation with the outer layers of the carbon dioxide matrix into the vacuum.
Result	Accounting for the target surface and the electron beam current, we can conclude that each implanted electron destroys 17 ± 4 CO2 cm−2, i.e. 51 ± 13 carbon dioxide molecules.
Background	The CO3 molecule has been also implied as an important intermediate in the 18O isotope enrichment of carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars.10,11
Background	Computations and laboratory experiments indicate that the 18O enrichment in ozone might be transferable to carbon dioxide,12,13 possibly via a CO3 intermediate.
Background	In dense clouds, these grains have typical temperatures of 10 K.40,41
Experiment	After the actual irradiation, the sample was kept isothermally at 10 K and heated then by 0.5 K min−1 to 293 K.
Object	We now investigate the fate of the generated oxygen atoms quantitatively.
Result	First, the experiments clearly indicated the formation of the cyclic s1 isomer; neither s2 nor t2 have been detected.
Conclusion	This probably causes the large variations in the film thicknesses estimated from different absorption features.
Goal	Secondly, reaction mechanisms to synthesize the carbon trioxide molecule together with other newly formed species will be derived combining our experimental data with electronic structure calculations.
Conclusion	Most importantly, our experiments indicated the initial formation of suprathermal (electronically excited) oxygen atoms.
Background	In the solid state, the O2 absorptions at 1591 cm−1 and 1617 cm−1 hold absorption coefficients of about 10−21 cm molecule−1 (ref. 37).

Result	It is acknowledged that operation at full conversion prevents a more complete analysis of the capability of the Pd(azide)/Al2O3 catalyst to function as an alkyne hydrogenation catalyst, nevertheless, Fig. 3 clearly indicates this substrate to constitute an active catalyst, worthy of further investigation.
Observation	Elemental analysis performed using a CE-440 elemental analyser prior to the reduction process8,9 was unable to detect the presence of nitrogen in either the support material or the Pd (azide)/Al2O3 catalyst.
Experiment	To illustrate this point the DRIFTS spectrum for a saturation CO coverage for a 1% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst prepared via wet impregnation and using Pd(NO3)2 as the precursor compound is presented in Fig. 2(b).
Background	Recently published CO spectra for well-annealed Pd/MgO catalysts also exhibit a minimal linear CO contribution under comparable conditions; in contrast the behaviour of a Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (prepared from PdCl2) is less well defined and a significant contribution from linear CO is retained upon evacuation.22
Observation	In the pulse chemisorption arrangement employed here, only high purity helium is present over the catalyst during spectral acquisition.
Conclusion	Given this wide application, future studies could examine the sensitivity of particle morphology to alumina structure by investigating structurally pure aluminas such as γ- and η-aluminas.
Background	Alumina-supported palladium catalysts for this purpose are usually prepared by surface science methods5,6 but this limits their ability to be tested in conventional microreactors.
Result	Following this approach, Fig. 2(b) shows, in agreement with Bertarione et al., that conventional catalyst preparations of alumina-supported Pd catalysts invariably lead to defect rich substrates.
Result	To demonstrate that the Pd(azide)/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits some effectiveness as a catalytic substrate, Fig. 3 presents the results for the hydrogenation of propyne at 293 K in a continuous flow reactor.
Experiment	This resulted in the rapid breakdown of the starting material that permitted the remaining solid product to mix intimately with the support material.
Observation	(insert in Fig. 1).
Observation	The spectrum more closely resembles that presented for numerous Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, e.grefs. 14–16., with a distinct signal due to linear CO clearly apparent.
Background	Continuing development of structure–activity relationships relevant to applied heterogeneous catalysis1,2 requires benchmark catalysts in which crystallite morphology is well defined and in which residues, resulting from the synthesis, which can complicate reactivity profiles3 and the vibrational spectra of probe molecules,4 are absent.
Result	This range is generally consistent with the mean particle size predicted from CO chemisorption.
Result	Furthermore, since surface impurities such as carbon increase the amount of linear bonded CO,23 the diffuse reflectance spectrum indicates that the Pd particles derived from the azide precursor exhibit clean facets.
Experiment	The sample was sealed in a glass sample container and was stable on exposure to air, where it was sieved to a grain size of 250–500 μm for subsequent analysis.
Observation	The Pd(azide)/Al2O3 spectrum is characterised by two intense, symmetrical features: a broad band at 1923 cm−1 and a sharp feature at 1984 cm−1 (FWHM = 21 cm−1).
Conclusion	This catalyst can be used to evaluate the role of low index planes in selective hydrogenation reactions and represents a useful benchmark against which preparative procedures, particle roughness, and catalytic activity can be evaluated.
Observation	Elemental analysis of this catalyst prior to reduction produced a nitrogen content of 0.42%.
Experiment	This material decomposes at 419 K 7 and so the reaction mixture was progressively warmed from room temperature to 473 K to effect the decomposition process.
Result	Furthermore, the catalyst described here offers modest dispersion.
Method	The catalyst is prepared according to eqns. (1) and (2) via a controlled explosion of the precursor.7
Result	Overall, the catalyst exhibits mostly regular particles, with diameters clustered about ca. 5 nm and 15 nm.
Observation	A representative TEM micrograph for the catalyst is presented in Fig. 1; metal crystallites are clearly discernible.
Result	In this respect, the infrared data are broadly consistent with the electron microscopy.
Result	Recognition of the general shape of the particles indicates that, to a first approximation, the particle surface can be described in terms of a small number of low index planes, i.e. (111) and (100), as identified by STM for the surface science model catalysts.5,6
Observation	High resolution TEM images show the Pd particles to be often composed of crystalline sub-units separated by grain boundaries, twin planes, etc.
Result	In contrast, Fig. 2(a) clearly shows the azide derived catalyst to exhibit a low concentration of defect sites.
Observation	Assuming the metal particles are spheres of equal diameter, the chemisorption result equates to a mean particle size of 8.3 nm.
Background	This disadvantage has been overcome by the synthesis of a benchmark alumina supported palladium material, which is an active catalyst for alkyne hydrogenation.
Observation	BET analysis indicated a surface area of 94 m2 g−1, indicating the new preparative method has no detrimental effect on total surface area.
Result	The origin of the sharp 1984 cm−1 feature is more complex.
Result	It is worthwhile considering the value of this material.
Conclusion	Thus, this catalyst then provides a reference material that could be used to evaluate the role that defect sites play in the surface chemistry/catalysis of supported palladium catalysts and is therefore ideally suited to in situ studies.26
Object	A model high surface area alumina-supported palladium catalyst
Experiment	This combination of procedures produced a free-flowing powder of uniform grey appearance.
Conclusion	Work is in progress to explore these exciting possibilities.
Result	This situation equates to CO spectra recorded post-evacuation of CO for the more conventional equilibrium measurements, which typically produce CO bands in the 2100 cm−1 region,14 characteristic of linear (on-top) CO. Studies on model Pd–Al2O3 catalysts revealed that more intense linear bands were observed for rougher surfaces.5,6,19
Experiment	The reactor was connected to a gas handling facility equipped with an evacuated reservoir of sufficient volume to contain the complete release of ammonia and nitrogen gas from the thermal decomposition of the tertramminepalladium(ii) tetraazidopalladate(ii).
Experiment	Tertramminepalladium(ii) tetraazidopalladate(ii) was synthesized by reaction of Pd(NH3)4Cl2 with sodium azide in water.7
Object	This inherently residue-free substrate provides a useful reference for evaluation of catalyst crystallite morphology and its effect on reactivity profiles.
Observation	Under the selected reaction conditions, full conversion and complete hydrogenation of the propyne are observed, with no loss of activity apparent over the duration studied.
Background	Bertarione et al. note that the linear CO signal reflects the defect concentration of supported Pd catalysts.22
Experiment	It was mixed with alumina (Degussa Oxid C, BET surface area 109 m2 g−1) in a Pyrex evacuable reaction vessel to produce a Pd loading of ca. 10% w/w.
Object	Additionally, the preparative technique described inherently leads to a residue-free material and the chemisorbed CO infrared spectrum indicates well ordered metal crystallites.
Result	On the basis of CO adsorption studies on metal single crystal and nanoparticle model catalysts16–19 the 1923 cm−1 band is assigned to μ3 hollow bonded CO and μ2 bridge bonded CO on the (111) planes of the Pd particles.
Conclusion	Although other preparative procedures could, in principle, also prepare such useful highly ordered catalysts, e.g. carefully controlled impregnation methods or MOCVD-based techniques,27 the azide based preparative route has the added advantage that it yields a minimal residue catalyst.
Background	According to combined vibrational and density functional studies on Pd surfaces of varying roughness, it may originate from CO adsorbed on (100) facets and from CO bridge bonded to particle edges and steps.20
Observation	Thus, the polyhedral nanoparticles are not always perfect single crystals but, nevertheless, they are still dominated by well developed low index facets with a low level of surface defects (one should note that distortions by the microcrystalline alumina support typically prevent high resolution imaging of particle facets).13
Experiment	To ensure no unstable residues remained within the mixture, the solid was then further warmed to 873 K in vacuum.
Background	However, even these contributions cannot explain the high intensity of the 1984 cm−1 peak and “intensity borrowing” from bridging CO on (111) facets (1923 cm−1) may therefore increase the intensity of the 1984 cm−1 peak.21
Observation	Pulsed chemisorption of CO showed the catalyst to saturate at 45 μmol CO g−1, which corresponds to 5.42 × 1019 surface Pd atoms g−1, assuming a Pd : CO surface stoichiometry of 2 : 18 and represents a metal dispersion of 13.1%.
Background	The novel synthetic feature is the use of thermally unstable tetramminepalladium(ii) tetraazidopalladate(ii)7 as the precursor compound rather than conventional precursors such as PdCl28 or Pd(NO3)2,9 which can potentially leave residues on the activated catalyst that can affect catalytic performance.10,11
Result	It is readily acknowledged that such an exotic (and potentially dangerous) preparative procedure could never be used to prepare industrial catalysts.
Object	The synthetic approach described in this work has the advantage of producing structured metal particles on a high surface area alumina support, that is ubiquitous in heterogeneous catalysis.
Observation	Some of the particles exhibit a distinct hexagonal structure, consistent with cubo-octahedra, as described by Hardeveld and Hartog12 and observed elsewhere.1,13
Conclusion	In summary, a novel preparative approach is described that inherently leads to a residue-free high surface area alumina-supported Pd catalyst, that presents a well defined crystallite morphology.
Object	In fact, alumina is thought to be the most widely used commercial carrier (support) material.24
Observation	CO chemisorption showed this catalyst to have a metal dispersion of 78%, which corresponds to a mean paricle size of ca. 1.4 nm.
Observation	Analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed the palladium loading to be 7.3%.
Result	However, this latter attribute could be improved by moderating the anneal temperature.25
Observation	The background subtracted diffuse reflectance spectrum in the region 1600–2300 cm−1 for a saturation coverage of CO on the Pd(azide) catalyst, achieved using a pulse-flow arrangement at 293 K, is presented in Fig. 2(a).
Observation	This spectrum is atypical for CO chemisorption on a supported palladium catalyst, in that there is effectively no contribution from linear CO at ca. 2100–2050 cm−1.14–16
Conclusion	A schematic representation of the adsorption sites populated at saturation CO coverage is shown in Fig. 4.
Background	CAUTION! Even though the resulting Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is stable, palladium azide compounds are explosive, see .ref. 7
Result	The effective absence of on-top CO in Fig. 2 is therefore interpreted as indicating that the present catalyst has a low concentration of relatively open sites of low metal coordination number.
Object	A catalyst preparative procedure is described that produces a high surface area alumina-supported palladium catalyst that yields an atypical chemisorbed carbon monoxide infrared spectrum.

Model	(ii) The solution is assumed to be sufficiently dilute and isothermal so that the viscosity and the density of the fluid can be considered to be unmodified by concentration or temperature variations.
Method	Automated analysis is thus routinely programmed to give priority to peptides having the highest ion current.
Background	Recently, the electrochemically induced tagging of peptides by probes electrogenerated at the microband electrode of a microspray emitter17 have enabled the on-line counting of cysteine units in peptides18 to improve the processes of identification of model proteins.19
Method	However, in the case of a complex mixture, the generation of CID spectra for all of the components fails because of time limitations.
Result	In Fig. 6, the corresponding working domains mark these conditions.
Model	(viii) The flow rate of the fluid is a fixed parameter.
Object	Electrochemical multi-tagging of cysteinyl peptides during microspray mass spectrometry: numerical simulation of consecutive reactions in a microchannel
Hypothesis	The initial concentration of HQ plays a key role in the final tagging degree since it controls the production of the BQ markers (in the present assumption of diffusion control of the current).
Model	The diffusion coefficients of the species are also treated as uniform in the entire study domain.
Experiment	Because of the 2 cm channel experimental length, scaling was necessary to have an acceptable mesh Péclet number while keeping a meshing grid and matrix size that could be numerically treated.
Background	The number of cysteine units is determined by mass spectrometry as the number of mass shift(s) from the unmodified peptide.
Background	As a post-column treatment, the technique would provide powerful information on cysteine content, notably for low intensity peptides that would not be selected for MS/MS.
Conclusion	This is further confirmed by several numerical studies at different concentrations while keeping the ratio [HQ]0/[P]0 constant (see supplementary information Fig. S1).
Model	To enable the MS cysteine counting in peptides in future experiments, we have decided to impose the following criteria for the simulation: both the proportion of P (= 100 × [P]/[P]0) and of the completely tagged species PQn (= 100 × [PQn]/[P]0) should be above 10% in order to be detectable by MS.
Model	(iii) The final electrochemical reaction involves the oxidation of the adduct, but under the present flow conditions this second electrochemical oxidation has no time to occur.
Method	A finite-element simulation of the multi-step process yields the relative distribution and concentration of tags, untagged and tagged species in the microchannel before the spray event.
Model	For simplification, the diffusion coefficient of all the quinone probes is taken to be equal to 3.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1, which in fact corresponds to the diffusion coefficient of methoxycarbonyl-1,4-hydroquinone in methanol–water–acetic acid 50 : 49 : .128
Model	(i) The electrochemical oxidation of HQ is assumed to be limited by the diffusion (fast electrode reaction) and HQ is assumed to be only species oxidised at the electrode.
Result	For the five-stage tagging (Fig. 7b), the conditions are almost never compatible except at high concentrations, and for very restrictive time ranges (for [HQ]0 = 25 mM, the reaction time must be fixed at 0.3 s).
Conclusion	Numerical simulations have been used to determine the optimal conditions for this.
Result	On the other hand, for initial HQ concentrations of 1 and 2.5 mM, the electrochemically-produced BQ is in deficit with respect to the cysteine moieties and, for high k values, BQ is found to be totally consumed before the end of the channel when the protein is still present (see Fig. 4c).
Model	(iii) The channel walls are considered to be smooth and the eventual migration effects due to the applied potential are neglected.
Experiment	The incoming HQ concentration was adapted to have the same flux ratio between the incoming protein or peptide P and the BQ generated at the electrode.
Result	The reaction is quite fast and the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached in about 2.5 s (i.e. 1 cm from the electrode).
Motivation	Counting the cysteine groups in a peptide using the isotopic signature of a specific tag for thiol12,15 or the differential analysis of unlabelled and labelled cysteinyl samples16 can be used to significantly improve protein identification by database searching.
Method	In this technique, peptides ions are sequentially selected for MS/MS from a mixture.10,11
Conclusion	To overcome this, the introduction of a recognition signal could be added to the tag.
Result	On the other hand, the residence time and the probe concentration should be sufficient to achieve all the tagging degrees.
Motivation	Because the starting peptide should not be totally converted to guarantee the success of the analysis, understanding the kinetics of the flow reaction is relevant to control the process and to generalize the technique.
Result	The formation of adduct PQ1 becomes efficient with methoxycarbonyl-1,4-hydroquinone (k = 5000 M−1 s−1), inducing subsequent consumption of both the biomolecule and the electrogenerated BQ.
Result	When the criteria level is reduced to 5%, a much wider working domain appears for the five-stage reaction (Fig. 7c).
Model	The present model is developed for species containing up to five cysteine groups.
Result	Nevertheless, a wide range of concentrations is then compatible with these short times: 0.6 s of reaction time allows working between 10 and 20 mM of HQ.
Method	Validated by comparison to previous works,22,23 a finite-element convection–diffusion reaction model for an electrochemical (EC) mechanism24 has been further developed for the consecutive tagging by markers electrogenerated at the bottom of a microchannel (2 cm in length).
Conclusion	The influence of the tagging rate constant as well as the impact of the probe and target concentrations have been simulated for a single and a five-step tagging reaction in a microchannel.
Experiment	The finite-element formulation was generated on the numerical software Flux-Expert® (Astek Rhône-Alpes, Grenoble, France), in a 2-D Cartesian form.
Observation	In Fig. 6a and b, the evolution of the species at the end of the channel is given according to [HQ]0 for biomolecules containing three and five cysteine groups, respectively.
Conclusion	Indeed, in proteomic analysis, the amounts of tryptic peptides derive from the protein concentrations, which are quite variable from one to another in a complex mixture.
Method	However, a sufficient coverage of the protein (i.e. the determination of a sufficient number of proteolytic peptides from a particular protein) is required to unambiguously identify a protein.
Experiment	The analyte is mixed with the electro-active probe prior to pressure-driven infusion through a capillary tube to the microspray emitter.
Model	It implies that only one thiol addition on the BQ core can happen.
Model	Therefore, a simple EC mechanism will be considered in the present study.
Observation	The error induced by a 7 μm channel mesh (compared to a 4 μm channel) was checked and found to be 0.01 and 0.05% for BQ and P respectively at the end of the channel (see Fig. S2 in the ESI).
Model	The addition rate constants are assumed to be equal to those corresponding to the addition of l-cysteine on 1,4-benzoquinone and methoxycarbonyl-1,4-benzoquinone (210 and 5000 M−1 s−1, respectively, in methanol–water–acetic acid 50 : 49 : 1).26,27
Model	The simulations correspond to a flow rate of 250 nL min−1 (i.e. a mean flow velocity v̄ = 4 × 10−3 m s−1 before scaling).
Experiment	The probes studied are 1,4-hydroquinone and methoxycarbonyl-1,4-hydroquinone (HQ in general).
Result	For k = 210 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 4a), the first adduct PQ1 is the only species produced in a reasonable amount.
Result	It has been checked by simulation that the ratio of flux of BQ at the electrode for the normal case (v̄ = 4 × 10−3 m s−1) over the scaling by 4 (v̄ = 1 × 10−3 m s−1) is 1.589 (≈1.6).
Method	A peptide with three cysteine groups serves as a reference since such peptides are more probable in proteomic analysis.
Hypothesis	When the [HQ]0 is too high, there is not enough P left and when it is too low, there is not enough PQn produced.
Result	The production is higher than in the case of a single-cysteine target (15.3 μM instead of 5.0 μM at the outlet of the channel) since here it possesses five cysteine groups.
Conclusion	When the molecule possesses more cysteine residues, the co-existence of both the untagged and fully tagged molecule is no more likely whatever the residence time.
Experiment	Then, a 0.5 cm long geometry was used but the channel height (2h) and the electrode length were kept the same (the electrode length remains quasi-negligible compared to channel length, i.e. the ratio is 1 : 50 instead of 1 : 200 for the experimental conditions).
Model	The multi-tagging process in a laminar flow is evaluated in terms of tagging extent TE (= (Σn [PQn])/[P]0 = ([P]0 – [P])/[P]0, i.e. the consumption of the protein or peptide P).
Model	The mean diffusion coefficient of the target biomolecule P was chosen to be 1 × 10−10 m2 s−1.29
Experiment	The same kinetic comparison was made for a biomolecule with five cysteine units (each cysteine site is considered to have the same labelling rate constant).
Model	In the Appendix, the global forms of these local equations are described for each species, using the Galerkin formulation (finite-element method).
Conclusion	It has been shown that the cysteine counting is possible for up to five units.
Background	In proteomics, the identities of most proteins represented in sequence databases can be determined by correlating mass spectrometric data with databases.1
Observation	The 10% working conditions are represented in Fig. 7a for the three cysteine peptide.
Method	The non-suppression of the unmodified molecule signal is essential to guarantee the success of the on-line MS counting of cysteine moieties.
Conclusion	The nature of the curve proves that the ratio [HQ]0/[P]0 can not be used as a term to predict the tagging extent in general.
Conclusion	Some mass tags presenting characteristic isotopic patterns could thus be employed.
Object	The control of the tagging extent allows the simultaneous MS analysis of both the unmodified and modified peptide(s).
Hypothesis	The initial concentration of HQ drives the tagging rate and thereby the proportion of the species at the end of the channel.
Observation	The fifth adduct PQ5 is also observable in small amounts.
Experiment	The flow rate was divided by four to ensure the same residence time in the channel and the same transversal diffusion time.
Observation	In the simulated data of Fig. 8, for a given reaction time t = 5 s (i.e. Lch = 2 cm), concentration [P]0 varies from 0.1 to 75 μM.
Model	Moreover, the flux of the protein NP coming into the channel is given byNP = [P]0FVWhatever the flow rate scaling, the ratio of these fluxes must be conservedTo conserve the ratio NBQ/NP if the flow rate is multiplied by 4, the initial concentration [HQ]0 must be multiplied by 42/3.
Model	Previous experimental MS mono-tagging of the synthetic peptide AIKCTK carried out with microchannel emitters of variable channel length have clearly shown that the channel contribution is predominant for a channel length of 2 cm with the present flow rate.25
Result	The conservation of species flux (BQ and P) was verified.
Result	In fact, the probability for the probe to react with a cysteine in a target possessing five cysteine groups is five-fold higher than the probability to react with cysteine in a single-cysteine target.
Result	The domain shows that high concentrations of HQ imply working over small times to ensure that P is not totally consumed.
Model	Numerical simulation studies were pursued with a scaling of 4.
Observation	Fig. 5 reports the influence of the HQ initial concentration on the TE (= (Σn [PQn])/[P]0 = ([P]0 – [P])/[P]0) of a species containing five cysteine units.
Model	The parameters playing a key role in the tagging final efficiency are investigated using the finite-element model (see Computational methods).
Model	The ∇ symbol is used to simplify the notation.
Experiment	The MS experimental set-up comprised the emitter shown in Fig. 1, which behaves as an electrolytic-flow cell reactor.
Method	The mass mapping or fingerprinting of peptides derived from proteolytic digestion of a protein provides the basic constraint.2–7
Model	The initial species concentrations are taken in accordance to previous experimental works that showed valuable analyses of proteins and peptides (Table 1).19,26
Model	The overall tagging process can proceed via an electrochemical–chemical–electrochemical (ECE) mechanism (Fig. 2) where:
Model	As the target biomolecule concentration is uniform at the inlet, its diffusion coefficient does not affect the final adduct amount (the diffusion coefficient of BQ plays an important role as the BQ generated at the electrode diffuses from the bottom of the channel and along the flow).24
Model	With the Levich equation,31,32 one can express a proportionality relationship between the flux rate of produced BQ at the electrode NBQ and the flow rate FV = v̄2hd (where v̄ is the mean flow velocity, 2h and d are the height and width of the channel)NBQ ∝ [HQ]0FV1/3From Relation 1, if the flow rate is divided by four, the flux of BQ is divided by 41/3 = 1.6.
Result	As shown in Fig. 7, tagging reaction times t in the channel could thus be chosen to make the two conditions expressed above compatible.
Result	The finite-element model has shown how strongly the tagging efficiency derives from the number of consecutive tagging reactions (i.e. the number of cysteine moieties in the protein or peptide determining the apparent kinetics of each consecutive reaction).
Model	(i) The first electrochemical reaction is the oxidation of HQ in 1,4-benzoquinone or methoxycarbonyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BQ in general).
Observation	The initial concentrations [HQ]0 that provide 10% of P and PQ3 according to each initial concentration [P]0 are reported.
Result	The reference point (◆) shows that [HQ]0 = 2.5 mM, which was used in the previous section, provides good analysis of three-cysteine peptides from 55 to 100 μM.
Experiment	The mesh size adopted for the channel was δ = 5 μm and it was reduced (i.e. to 0.4 μm) at the electrode extremities in order to take into account the edge effects.
Method	In the previous section, a target with five cysteine groups was used for emphasizing kinetics and a better understanding of the multi-stage process.
Model	(vi) The reactivity of cysteine is taken to be equal at every site of the biomolecule (equal to that of the cysteine amino acid) and any other parasite reactions are neglected.
Background	The molecular weight of the protein, the isoelectric point of the protein or tryptic peptides,14and the presence of rare amino acids such as cysteine, methionine, or tryptophan in the peptide sequence provide powerful information to enhance the matching.
Conclusion	In other words, when the apparent kinetics become slower, the fixed conditions are satisfied for wider time ranges (the scale is widespread due to the second order kinetic law).
Goal	The present theoretical work establishes the range of optimal conditions to achieve the counting of cysteine units in peptides, in order to apply the counting/identification technique to complex protein mixtures.
Model	(vii) The numerical simulations of the tagging reaction are considered only in the channel, thereby neglecting the reactions in the Taylor cone or in the ESI plume.
Background	Here, the cysteine content determination relies on the control of the extent of the reaction to ensure that a minimum amount of the unmodified peptide together with a minimum amount of the fully tagged peptide is produced.
Observation	For k = 5000 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 4b), almost all of the BQ generated at the electrode is consumed at the end of the channel.
Result	The total mesh number is 30 000, leading to 240 000 degrees of freedom for the eight unknowns in the five-tagging case.
Result	For a three cysteine peptide (Fig. 6a) the two conditions are compatible (1.755 mM < [HQ]0 < 2.275 mM), but the two working domains do not intersect for a five cysteine peptide (Fig. 6b).
Method	Therefore, when the mixture is complex, many detected ions with low intensities are not fragmented, thus reducing the dynamic range of the method.
Background	The tagging reaction happens in the microspray emitter which behaves as an electrolytic-flow cell reactor and is quasi-instantaneous.
Result	It confirms the mesh Péclet number limit of 100 determined in the literature.30
Motivation	Procedures capable of enhancing the identification procedure are of great value.
Experiment	The resulting mesh Péclet number PS = v̄δ/D was found to be 50 and 14 for the P and the BQ respectively.
Experiment	Simulations were first run for a species containing a single thiol group.
Conclusion	The present theoretical work establishes the range of optimum conditions for the determination of the number of cysteine groups in peptides containing up to five cysteine groups.
Conclusion	For successful cysteine counting, the initial concentration of P is also a key feature to consider, all the more so as [P]0 is not really controlled by the manipulator.
Method	Tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of peptides in mixtures is the most common and restrictive constraint used in addition to mass mapping.8,9
Result	When working with a longer reaction time, the concentration possibilities are narrower but the analysis can be done at many times (for instance, the analysis is possible from 2 to more than 5 s for an initial concentration of 2 mM).
Goal	The work focuses on the tagging of cysteine moieties in peptides or proteins by electrogenerated quinone mass probes.
Model	(v) The fluid is assumed to be Newtonian and its velocity is described according to a Poiseuille profile (laminar flow conditions, Re = 0.035).
Object	The main chemical parameters determining the kinetics of the labelling are assessed and discussed considering the microfluidic aspects of the process.
Result	Between the two curves, the hatched domain indicates that both conditions are satisfied.
Background	The accuracy in the mass determinations is a way of constraining the database search.12,13
Observation	When the BQ is in excess ([HQ]0 ≥ 6 mM), a total conversion of P is obtained for k values above 2500 M−1 s−1.
Result	Therefore, the reaction rate is multiplied as shown below.Part of the first adduct PQ1 reacts with BQ to give the successive adducts, the production of which is limited to PQ2 for the present k value.
Conclusion	This result is not only the effect of the addition rate constant but also a consequence of the multi-tagging that amplifies this tendency.
Conclusion	It implies that the species P, PQ1, PQ2, PQ3, PQ4 and PQ5 remain unchanged for x > 1 cm (no more BQ to react).
Model	(ii) The chemical reaction is the 1,4-Michael addition of the thiol functional group of the cysteine of a protein or peptide (P) on the BQ ring that yields the products (PQi), where i represents the number of cysteine groups being tagged.
Result	The production of all adducts is enhanced, apart from the first, whose concentration decreased beyond a distance of 5 mm from the electrode (i.e. 1.25 s of reaction) to feed the following additions.
Model	The mean concentration [BQ] remains unchanged by this operation asThe scaling was fully validated by the numerical comparisons of the concentration of BQ and PQ3 along the channel for a scaling by 2 (channel length of 10 mm) and 4 (channel length of 5 mm), which appear in Figs. S3 and S4 in the ESI.
Observation	In Fig. 3, a comparison of species distributions along the channel in its central portion (y = h) is proposed for the two probes considered for a single-cysteine target.
Model	(iv) The width d of the channel is assumed to be much larger than its height 2h so that the velocity gradient in the third dimension can be neglected (2D Cartesian assumption to overcome numerical limitations).
Result	The first step of the consecutive tagging reactions presents an apparent rate constant k1 = 5k since the rate law is here formulated as a function of the biomolecule concentration [P] (Fig. 2).
Result	The electrogenerated BQ, which is correlated to the HQ initial concentration, is in deficit with respect to cysteine units.
Method	On-line electrogeneration of mass tags in a microspray emitter is used to quantify the number of cysteine groups in a given peptide.
Result	As expected, the higher the [HQ]0, the higher the consumption of P and the production of the completely tagged species (i.e. PQ3 and PQ5 for peptides containing three and five cysteine groups, respectively).
Background	To numerically simulate the on-line electrochemical tagging of peptides, multi-stage chemical reactions should be considered in a fluid flow.20,21
Model	This transient model (eqn (1)) is applied in a steady state regime to a 2D cross section of the geometry (see section 2.2 and Fig. 1):where ci is the concentration of the species i, Di its diffusion coefficient, v is the fluid velocity vector and Ri is the rate of generation or consumption of i (Fig. 2).
Model	It addresses the convection–diffusion reaction of the eight species i considered here (HQ, BQ, P, PQ1–5 for the hydroquinone, the benzoquinone, the protein or peptide, and the five possible successive degrees of the tagged protein or peptide, respectively).
Method	In most cases a collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectrum from a single peptide through electrospray (ESI) MS/MS is then sufficient to conclusively identify a protein.
Model	The tagging conditions and numerical parameters are given in Table 1 and in the computational section (Flux-Expert® software).
Result	The number of cysteine groups corresponds to the number of characteristic mass shifts observed from the unmodified peptide.
Background	To narrow down possible matching candidates, specific searching constraints are needed.
Experiment	Simulations with a rate constant of k = 20 000 M−1 s−1 were performed as shown in Fig. 4c.
Observation	The second adduct PQ2 is the most favoured species at the end of the channel (15 μM).
Experiment	It was operated on a Dell PC, 2 Gb RAM (Red Hat Linux).
Conclusion	The high kinetics limits the consumption of P because the following steps consume BQ rapidly.
Goal	Some numerical simulations are carried out for the addition of one to up to five tags (multi-step consecutive reactions) to determine the major chemical and kinetic parameters involved in the microfluidic process.
Conclusion	The technique appears applicable to peptides containing five or less cysteine groups since the co-existence of P and PQn is no more likely when more cysteine groups are present as BQ is stocked in the intermediate species.
Result	Defining the ratio Δ[HQ]0/[HQ]0 for the 10% working domain, 0.51 and 0.31 are obtained for [P]0 = 0.l and 75 μM, respectively, showing that the working interval slightly decreases with the concentration.

Background	The two components of the monomer bands are due to the inversion.13
Experiment	The Ar/hydrogen mixture was passed through a microwave discharge.
Result	The largest difference in the calculated shifts is obtained for the HOOH torsion, which is calculated to be blue shifted in the five membered ring complex and red shifted in the six-membered ring complex.
Conclusion	The strongest of these, at 2926 cm−1, is probably due to the overtone of the HOO bend of complexed HOO.
Background	The same calculations indicate that we should observe two torsion bands for the HOOH monomer since the trans barrier is low, and indeed we observe two bands for monomer HOOH, close to the expected positions.14
Result	Experiments with partially deuterated hydrogen peroxide show that the 3432 cm−1 band is due to HOOH.
Background	In complexes of the type studied here, the intramolecular vibrations of the complex components retain their original character in the complex.
Result	Bands are assigned to the hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex, if they appear only when hydrogen peroxide and peroxy radicals are simultaneously present in the matrix, if they have constant intensity ratios directly after deposition, independent of the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and peroxy radicals, and if they decrease at the same rate when the matrix is irradiated.
Result	We have observed a number of intermolecular bands of the hydrogen peroxide complex (Fig. 2).
Model	Therefore, the perturbed ith fundamental of A in a complex with B will be denoted as νi(A–B).
Result	This makes the assignment very difficult, since the mid-infrared spectra indicate that there are two different isomers of the HOOD peroxy radical complex.
Background	Two OH stretches at 3432 cm−1 and 3206 cm−1 have been observed as two weak bands in many previous experiments with peroxy radicals, see for instance Fig. 2 of .Ref. 2
Conclusion	One therefore expects to find 12 bands due to the DOOD and HOOD peroxy radical complexes in a given experiment.
Result	The assignment of the far infrared spectrum is collected in Table 4.
Result	The corresponding bands of HOOH–DOO have been observed in experiments where D2 was passed through the microwave discharge instead of H2.
Background	The hydrogen peroxide forms a hydrogen bond to the end oxygen of the peroxy radical in both structures.
Result	The results in this region are in very good agreement.
Conclusion	We believe that the the dissociation energy of the peroxy radical hydrogen peroxide complex is of the order of 6.5 to 7 kcal mol−1, the calculations of ref. 12 gave 7.7 kcal mol−1 (De, corrected for BSSE).
Experiment	Infrared spectra were recorded, at 17 K, between 185 and 4000 cm−l with a Bruker 113 v spectrometer.
Background	The coupling between the bends depends on the dihedral angle between the HOO groups which may differ between the complex and the dimer.
Result	The assignment is significantly aided by the fact that the hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex decomposes very rapidly when irradiated with 266 nm radiation, significantly faster than the hydrogen peroxide dimer.
Conclusion	It seems reasonable to assume that the trans barrier of hydrogen peroxide complexed with a peroxy radical is relatively low so that there are two close low lying torsion states, a symmetric and an antisymmetric combination of the complexes with the free hydrogen of hydrogen peroxide above and below the plane of the other atoms.
Background	Ab initio calculations on the hydrogen peroxide dimer suggest that we should expect three intermolecular fundamentals above 200 cm−1 for the HOOH–HOO complex, librations of the two complex components around their OO axis and the torsion of hydrogen peroxide.14
Result	We found it difficult to control the H/D ratio sufficiently well to make it possible to avoid the presence of significant concentrations of HOOD in these experiments.
Result	However, the C2 symmetric isomer, which has the two non hydrogen bonded hydrogens on the same side of the plane of the heavy atoms has a relatively large dipole moment and is expected from ab initio SCF calculations to be approximately 50 cm−1 higher in energy than the Ci isomer.
Result	The complex shift of the OH stretch of the peroxy radical is −207 cm−1 suggesting that the hydrogen bond from the peroxy radical to hydrogen peroxide is stronger than the hydrogen bond from hydrogen peroxide to the radical.
Result	The two bands with highest frequencies are observed in the region where the bolometer spectra and the MCT spectra overlap.
Result	The precise position depends on the isotopic composition of the complex partner.
Conclusion	Experiences from many other systems suggests that with few exceptions, only the most stable complex structure is observed, this seems to be the case also for the HOOH–HOO complex.
Result	For the HOO bends of HOOH, the shifts are larger in the HOOH–DOOD dimer than in the peroxy radical complex.
Experiment	An MCT detector was used in the mid-infrared and a liquid helium cooled Ge-bolometer in the far infrared.
Background	It is more difficult to obtain precisely matched sample and background spectra in the far infrared, where the wavelengths are comparable to for instance the matrix thickness.
Result	The hydrogen peroxide monomer is hardly touched during the time it takes to eliminate the peroxy radical complex.
Object	We have made a number of experiments with partially deuterated hydrogen peroxide, both with HOO and DOO.
Background	Unfortunately even minute changes in for instance the cryostat position are sufficient to obliterate the cancellation.
Result	It therefore seems clear that the 3206 cm−1 band is due to the OH stretch of HOO complexed to hydrogen peroxide.
Conclusion	In addition the 1428 cm−1 band is likely to be lowered somewhat by an interaction with the HOO radical bend at 1487 cm−1 and 1496 cm−1.
Result	Even more surprising is that the hydrogen peroxide dimer bands, which have very stable positions in experiments where only hydrogen peroxide is present in the matrix7 show shifts in these experiments, these shifts correlate with the shifts of the hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex bands.
Conclusion	We have previously noted a phenomenon, which we believe is related to the one observed here.
Experiment	In one volume argon (L′Air Liquide 99.9995%) was mixed with O2 (L’Air Liquide, 999 995%).
Conclusion	It seems reasonable to assume that the highest calculated intermolecular fundamental at 647.6 cm−1(only the QCSID values for the six-membered ring complex are considered) corresponds to the observed HOO libration at 557 cm−1.
Result	When hydrogen peroxide is added to the matrix, they grow strongly as expected if they are due to a hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex (Fig. 1).
Observation	We observe four far infrared bands for HOOH–HOO (Fig. 2).
Background	Ideally these should cancel in the ratio between sample and background spectra.
Result	The two HOO bends are strongly coupled, in HOOD the HOO bend is found at 1343 cm−1, approximately midway between the two HOO bends of HOOH (1385 cm−1 and 1271 cm−1) and the DOO bend is found at 981 cm−1 close to the average of the two DOOD bends.
Background	Its interactions with stable molecules influences the stabilization of newly formed hot radicals and it may influence its reactivity.
Result	The complex shift, −207 cm−1, is slightly larger than the corresponding shift of the peroxy radical water complex, −177 cm−1.
Conclusion	The strength of the complex is very similar to that of the hydrogen peroxide dimer.
Background	In these experiments, we have observed weak bands, which we suspected to be due to a hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex, since hydrogen peroxide, which forms from the reaction between two peroxy radicals, is always present in our experiments.
Result	The calculated OO shifts of the peroxy radical are approximately 10 times larger than the observed shift for both structures.
Experiment	The temperature of the adduct was +16 °C in most experiments.
Result	The assignment of the mid-infrared spectrum is collected in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
Observation	The low concentration components weaken and ultimately vanish at high impurity concentrations.
Experiment	The gas mixtures were deposited on a CsI-window, cooled to 17 K by a Leybold RDK 10–320 closed cycle cryocooler.
Method	The experimental procedure has been described in earlier publications.2,7,8
Result	Both calculations and experiment agree that this is an intense band.
Observation	Peroxy radicals formed on the surface of the growing matrix by the addition of hydrogen (deuterium) atoms from the discharge to molecular oxygen.
Result	The B3LYP calculations give very large shifts for the OH stretches of hydrogen peroxide and the peroxy radical for the six-membered ring structure, 1.4 and 1.8 times larger than the observed shifts respectively.
Observation	In the monomer calculation, the two lowest states were split by 10 cm−1 and were approximately 300 cm−1 below the trans barrier, the third lowest state was very close to the barrier and the next state approximately 100 cm−1 above the barrier.
Conclusion	In order to understand this apparent discrepancy between the stretch shift and the bend shifts we note that the two OH stretches of hydrogen peroxide are almost independent, in HOOD the OH stretch almost coincides with the two OH stretches of HOOH.13
Observation	The corresponding band of DOOD complexed to HOO is found at 2536 cm−1.
Conclusion	The appearance of two strongly red shifted OH stretches from the peroxy radical hydrogen peroxide complex clearly suggest that the complex is cyclic, with both components acting as hydrogen bond donors and as hydrogen bond acceptors (Fig. 3).
Model	In order to indicate which hydrogens are engaged in the formation of the hydrogen bonds we write the complex with these hydrogens next to each other, for instance DOOH–HOO and OOH–HOOD denotes a complex where HOOD is H-bonded to HOO.
Conclusion	This makes the harmonic oscillator approximation used in the calculations completely unrealistic.
Background	This makes it harder to observe weak bands.
Conclusion	If the barrier is lowered in the complex, the two upper states will be even further away from two interacting tunnel states than in the monomer and therefore even further apart than in the monomer.
Experiment	After the initial spectra had been recorded the matrix was irradiated with 266 nm radiation from a quadrupled Continuum NY 20 C YAG laser, and new spectra were recorded.
Method	We have used matrix isolation combined with infrared spectroscopy to study its interactions with small, stable molecules.2–6
Background	The second minimum is a five-membered ring with a hydrogen bond from the peroxy radical to the hydrogen peroxide oxygen, which is bound to the hydrogen of the hydrogen bond.
Conclusion	In fact the HOOH part of the mid-infrared spectrum of the HOOH peroxy radical complex is quite similar to the spectrum of HOOH in a dimer formed between HOOH and DOOD where there are no resonant interactions between the dimer components.7
Observation	In HOOH monomer the corresponding bands are observed at 273.2 cm−1 and at 373.5 cm−1 respectively.
Result	The assignment is collected in Table 4.
Method	A brief description is given below.
Observation	The deposition time was 2 h and the deposition rate 10 mmol h−1.
Model	We have tried to assign the observed bands guided by the results for HOOH and the assumption that the torsion frequencies are mainly determined by the mass of the free hydrogen of the complexed hydrogen peroxide.
Observation	When DOO is used instead of HOO, the 3432 band shifts to 3429 cm−1, the 3206 cm−1 band disappears, and a new band appears in the OD stretching region at 2383 cm−1.
Observation	In the hydrogen peroxide monomer spectrum, in matrices with a low content of polar impurities, the OH stretch and the antisymmetric HOO bend have two relatively sharp components.
Result	The OO stretch of the complexed peroxy radical is observed at 1121 cm−1, very close to the corresponding band of the peroxy radical water complex (1120 cm−1, ref. 2).
Method	Two separate deposition lines were used.
Observation	The shift of the bound OH stretch of HOOH is −132 cm−1 in the dimer and −156 cm−1 in the peroxy radical complex.
Result	It is difficult to compare the calculated intermolecular vibrations with the experimentally observed far infrared bands, since no description of the calculated bands is given in the paper and the calculations are done only for the HOOH–HOO isotopologue.
Result	The irradiation has the additional advantage that the base line is almost unchanged by the irradiation.
Result	The hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex is clearly more strongly bound than the hydrogen peroxide dimer.
Conclusion	The shifts are surprisingly different, but we do not think this automatically shows that the assignment is wrong.
Background	The most stable structure is a six-membered ring where the peroxy radical forms a hydrogen bond to the hydrogen peroxide oxygen, which binds the free hydrogen.
Observation	The high frequency bend is found at 1436 cm−1 in the HOOH–DOOD dimer and at 1428 cm−1 in the complex and the low frequency bend appears at 1291 cm−1 in the dimer and at 1283 cm−1 in the complex.
Background	A very recent calculation appears to support this structure.12
Observation	The original spectra contain interference fringes from different optical elements.
Observation	The band at 557 cm−1 appears to shift to slightly above 400 cm−1 when DOO is substituted for HOO.
Conclusion	We are therefore convinced that the B3LYP method gives a rather poor description of the complex.
Result	The hydrogen bond from the peroxy radical to hydrogen peroxide is calculated to be stronger than the hydrogen bond from hydrogen peroxide to the peroxy radical.
Object	The HOOH–HOO complex. A matrix isolation study
Result	Experiments with partially deuterated hydrogen peroxide have made it possible to observe some of the intramolecular fundamentals of the D2O2 and HDO2 complexes with HOO (Table 1) and DOO (Table 2).
Conclusion	If the barrier is not too different for complexed HOOH compared to monomer HOOH, the next two torsion states are close to the maximum of the trans barrier and therefore strongly split.
Background	The peroxy radical participates in numerous oxidation reactions.1
Background	Both hydrogen peroxide and the peroxy radical act as hydrogen bond donors2,9,10 and as hydrogen bond acceptors,2,11 and both form cyclic complexes whenever possible.
Result	Also for the HOOH (DOOD) band the complex shift is relatively large, −156 cm−1 (−110.0 cm−1), giving clear evidence for a hydrogen bond from hydrogen peroxide to the peroxy radical.
Result	Both bands are strongly blue shifted from the HOO bends of hydrogen peroxide and the peroxy radical as expected for a cyclic, hydrogen bonded complex.
Result	The calculated bound OH shifts of the six-membered ring complex are both significantly closer to the observed shifts.
Method	It is possible to control the HOOH concentration in the matrices by changing the temperature of the urea complex.
Method	In a second volume argon was mixed with H2(AGA) or D2 (L’Air liquide).
Method	Deuterated hydrogen peroxide was prepared as described in .ref. 13
Observation	At the same time as the 3432 cm−1 and 3206 cm−1 bands appear, bands are observed at 1428 cm−1, 1487 cm−1 and 1496 cm−1.
Result	We have difficulties in understanding the nature of the second largest calculated intermolecular fundamental at 544.6 cm−1.
Background	For the hydrogen peroxide dimer the dissociation energy (De) was calculated to be 6.3 kcal mol−1 on the MP2 level.7
Result	For both bends, the complex shifts are smaller for the peroxy radical complex than for the mixed dimer.
Result	Deuteration experiments show that the 1428 cm−1 band is due to HOOH and the 1487 cm−1, 1497 cm−1 doublet is due to HOO.
Result	This conclusion is supported by the observation of two strongly blue shifted HOO bends, one from each component.
Conclusion	If we accept the assignment of the intermolecular fundamentals of HOOH–HOO, the assignment of the corresponding fundamentals of the HOOH–DOO complex is straight forward.
Result	It should be noted that the strongest bands which we assign to a hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex are too strong to be due to 1∶2 (2∶1) complex.
Result	The shifts of several wavenumbers of some complex bands between different experiments is very surprising (Fig. 4).
Background	It is also hard to vary the peroxy radical concentration in a systematic way, since the efficiency of the microwave discharge, which produces the hydrogen atoms, varies between different experiments.
Result	We therefore assign the 557 cm−1 band to the libration of complexed HOO around its OO bond.
Conclusion	Our spectra give clear evidence for this structure, we observe two strongly red shifted OH stretches and two strongly blue shifted HOO bends one from each complex component.
Conclusion	It is perhaps possible that the coupling between the hydrogen peroxide libration and the hydrogen peroxide torsion is very strong, giving one upper and one lower component both with significant torsion and libration contents.
Observation	The non hydrogen bonded OH stretch of hydrogen peroxide is observed at 3574 cm−1 and the corresponding HOO bend at 1284 cm−1.
Result	The complex shifts of the QCISD calculations are in reasonable agreement with the observations, the OH shifts of the OH bonds involved in the hydrogen bonds are somewhat smaller the the observed shifts but the general pattern of the shifts agrees well with the observations.
Conclusion	The electric field from a peroxy radical within 10 Å from a complex may inhibit the tunneling of the non bonded hydrogen and perhaps also shift its equilibrium dihedral angle, which in turn will influence the fundamentals directly involved in the hydrogen bond system of the complex.
Conclusion	A similar mechanism is possible for the hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complex, which should have a large dipole moment whose direction is determined by the orientation of the non hydrogen bonded hydrogen of hydrogen peroxide.
Result	One is closer to the phonon band in the far infrared, this makes relaxation a low order process and therefore decreases lifetimes of excited states.
Background	The remaining intermolecular fundamentals will involve oxygen atom motions and have much lower frequencies.
Experiment	A resolution of 0.5 cm−1 and an average of 512 scans was used in the mid-infrared while in the far infrared it was sufficient to use a resolution of 1 cm−1 and 128 scans.
Result	In these experiments we observe a number of far infrared bands whose photolysis rates clearly shows that they are due to hydrogen peroxide peroxy radical complexes.
Background	We suggested in an earlier publication that polar impurities introduced electric fields in the matrix, which strongly perturbed the hydrogen peroxide inversion.8
Result	This assignment implies that the 277 cm−1 band and the 477 cm−1 band are due to the HOOH torsion.
Background	Two cyclic structures are found to represent local minima on the potential energy surface of HOOH–HOO in ref. 12, both at the B3LYP and QCISD levels of theory.
Conclusion	A strong electric field may stabilize the C2 isomer.
Background	Intermolecular vibrations, which are found in this region, involve the motions of the complex forming molecules as rigid entities which tends to make the coupling to the matrix stronger than in the mid-infrared where the vibrations tend to be localized in one of the complex forming molecules.
Conclusion	The bands observed give clear evidence that both HOOD–DOO and DOOH–DOO exist.
Result	The bands at 485 cm−1 and 272 cm−1 are assigned to the torsion of HOOH and the 220 cm−1 band to the libration of HOOH, the libration of DOO is observed at 415 cm−1.
Result	The hydrogen peroxide libration is therefore expected to be less than 0.7 of the peroxy radical libration, the calculated frequency is 100 cm−1 larger than one expects from this argument.
Experiment	The Ar/O2 ratio was varied between 50/1 and 75/1.
Result	During the study of the HOOH–HOO complex, we noted that the positions of some of its bands were sensitive to the concentration of dopants in the matrix, shifting several wavenumbers between different experiments.
Conclusion	More likely is that a polar molecule not too far from one of the non-hydrogen-bonded hydrogens of the Ci dimer inhibits the inversion of the dimer.
Result	Unfortunately it is impossible to compare the calculated torsions with the experimental torsion since the low trans barrier of the complex allows rapid tunneling in the torsionally excited state.
Result	It is more difficult to choose between the two structures.
Method	This gas mixture was then swept over the urea–hydrogen peroxide adduct kept a fixed temperature as described by Pettersson et al.13
Background	Since the dipole moment of hydrogen peroxide changes its direction upon inversion, the presence of an electric field may stabilize one of the two torsion minima and destabilize the other.
Background	However, a more complete assignment of the spectrum of the complex required studies of the hydrogen peroxide dimer 7 and of the water hydrogen peroxide complex,8 since water is another byproduct of the peroxy radical synthesis.
Observation	When polar impurities are present, bands appear approximately midway between the two low concentration components.
Conclusion	The shift of the bound OH stretch of HOOH is 25 cm−1 more negative in the peroxy radical complex than in the DOOD complex, indicating that the peroxy radical is a better hydrogen bond acceptor than hydrogen peroxide.
Result	We suggest that the 227 cm−1 band of HOOH–HOO should be assigned to the libration of HOOH around its OO axis.
Hypothesis	It therefore seems reasonable to expect their complex to have a cyclic structure, essentially the structure of the hydrogen peroxide dimer,7 minus one of the two nonbonded hydrogens.
Result	Also most other calculated shifts of the six-membered ring are closer to the experimentally observed shifts that those of the five membered ring (Table 5).
Background	The addition of extra hydrogen peroxide to matrices containing peroxy radicals confirmed our suspicions.
Method	It is interesting to compare the experimental complex shifts of HOOH–HOO with the calculated shifts of ref. 12 (Table 5).
Result	For the five membered ring structure the OH shift of the hydrogen peroxide is 0.50 of the observed shift and the OH shift of the peroxy radical is 1.5 times the observed shift.
Background	The equilibrium structure of the hydrogen peroxide dimer has Ci symmetry and consequently no dipole moment.
Result	Compared to mid-infrared bands of matrix isolated molecules, bands in the far infrared tend to be weaker and broader.
Result	A weak band at 868 cm−1 is assigned to the OO stretch of complexed HOOH.
Background	It is rather difficult to control the concentrations of HOOD and DOOD, since different preparations give different degrees of deuteration.
Conclusion	The peroxy radical forms a cyclic complex with hydrogen peroxide, with both entities acting as hydrogen bond donors and as hydrogen bond acceptors.
Background	The librations of the two complex components involve only H-motions and are therefore expected to have high frequencies.
Result	In addition to the intramolecular fundamental bands, we observe a number of relatively weak bands which fulfill our criteria for assignment to the peroxy radical hydrogen peroxide complex.
Experiment	Their gas flows were regulated by Nupro needle valves.
Result	The lowest band, at 227 cm−1, is close to a band at 219 cm−1 of the hydrogen peroxide dimer, which we believe is due to the libration of HOOH in the dimer.14
Observation	Experiments with hydrogen through the discharge contain only HOO radicals and experiments with deuterium through the discharge contain DOO and only traces of HOO.
Result	Both hydrogen peroxide monomer and dimer have clear and strong far infrared bands, which partially obscure the bands of the peroxy radical hydrogen peroxide complex.

Observation	Based on these model parameters, various macroscopic and microscopic properties of these helicates can be predicted.
Background	More recently, attention shifted toward supramolecular multi-center assemblies, which result from the interactions between several ligands and metal ions.1
Result	This process follows the one-to-one exchange isotherm since there is no difference in the interactions between the two metal ions.
Model	The partition function is asymptotically given by Ξ ∼ λN for N → ∞If the largest eigenvalue cannot be found analytically, it can be easily calculated numerically.
Conclusion	With the present approach one can not only treat receptors with a small number of binding sites, but also macromolecular receptors capable of binding a large number of metal ions.
Result	We introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.
Result	The macrospecies [La2Eu(L3)3]6+ consists of the two microspecies, the dominant asymmetric complex [EuLaLa(L3)3]9+ and the symmetric minority complex [LaEuLa(L3)3]9+.
Model	Let us express the macrostate probability in terms of the microstate probabilities where δn,m is unity for n = m and zero otherwise.
Background	To approach such questions, microscopic site binding models have been proposed to address the competition between protons and multi-dentate metal binding to polyelectrolytes.21
Model	The chemical potential term µ can be related to the metal ion activity a and the microscopic binding constant K of the metal to a binding center when all other centers are empty by µ = kT ln aK. 
Model	The largest eigenvalue of eqn. (25) can be evaluated analytically as.
Model	To introduce the transfer matrix technique, consider a linear structure and nearest neighbor pair range interactions.27
Model	The latter factor of two arises since there are two equivalent terminal sites.
Result	One further observes that the binding of La3+ is weakened through the presence of neighboring Eu3+ ions.
Result	The fit cannot be substantially improved by allowing for further variation in the interaction parameters.
Model	In the intermediate situation, one obtains mixed complexes shown in Fig. 7.
Result	Depending on the magnitude of the individual interactions, at intermediate loading one can obtain random arrangements for E = 0, alternating arrangements for E > 0, or clustering of the same metal ions for E < 0 (see Fig. 6).
Result	Consideration of a next nearest neighbor interaction energy gives equally no effect.
Background	In this context, multi-metal supramolecular lanthanide complexes are particularly interesting, as the search for new receptors displaying selective binding along the 4f-block series provides a substantial database of macroscopic and microscopic stability constants.4
Observation	At xEu = 0.01, various mixed complexes appear, in particular the mixed ternary complex [NdSmEu(L1)2]3+ (see Fig. 11(b)).
Model	In order to define this recursion, let us consider a restricted partition function for a sub-chain of length n, such that the values of the state vector of the last site are restricted to given values s, namely where δs,s′ is unity when s = s′ and zero otherwise.
Model	When we consider nearest neighbor interactions only, we now have two pair interaction energies, namely E(LaLa), E(EuEu).
Model	Recall that the binding state of the receptor is uniquely defined with a set of given state variable vectors {si}.
Result	On the other hand, in the macrospecies [LaEu2(L3)3]9+ the symmetric complex [EuLaEu(L3)3]9+ is dominant, while the asymmetric complex [LaEuEu(L3)3]9+ is in minority.
Model	Obviously, there are only mixed complexes with two or three metal ions.
Object	As a first example, consider trimetallic complexes of 1,3,5-triamino-1,3,5-trideoxy-cis-inositol (taci) L1H3 with Nd3+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ (see Fig. 1 and 2).11
Model	The complexes with one metal ion has been discussed above, see Fig. 4, while Fig. 8 summarizes the mixed complexes.
Result	The microconstants to remove the respective metal ions from each site are summarized in Fig. 14.
Observation	The measured equilibrium constants11 are reported in Table 1.
Model	Again, the properties of short chains can be evaluated analytically.
Model	For the sake of simplicity, let us consider two types of metal ions M(1) and M(2) only.
Background	Examples of such complexes are shown in Fig. 1, and the structure of the ligands in Fig. 2.
Result	When both components are in excess, one can show that the model can be again reduced to the linear chain model with the effective pair interaction energy E = E(11) + E(22) − 2E(12)or equivalently.
Model	Some algebra leads to the closed form of the adsorption isotherm where θ(z) is the mono-component isotherm given by eqn. (29) evaluated at z = z1 + z2.
Model	Since these constants are the same for all three sites, the conditional probability to find the microspecies with the central site occupied is 1/3, while when the terminal site is occupied 2/3.
Model	The transfer matrix reads where we have introduced the abbreviations zω = αωK(ω) and uωη = exp(−E(ωη)/kT).
Model	One also obtains two microspecies when the receptor binds two metal ions.
Result	From this model, the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems enters in a natural way.
Method	From the known ionization constants of L1H3,28 one can evaluate the conditional constants of these equilibria.
Motivation	Proper understanding of these processes is essential for stimulating molecular programming, and for switching from the usual deductive chemical approach toward induction.3
Model	Consider a receptor with several binding sites, each of which can bind a single metal ion.
Method	For an infinite polyelectrolyte chain, the binding isotherms can be evaluated by standard techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics.
Model	The macroconstants β12 and β21 are again obtained by considering the pair interactions and the symmetry numbers.
Observation	The macrostate probabilities are displayed as a function of the free concentration ratio [Sm3+]/[Nd3+], where the free concentrations have been set equal to the activities for simplicity.
Model	The entire concentration dependence is captured by the macrostate probability.
Conclusion	In most situations, however, the receptor is composed of different ligands, which have to assemble in order to form the complex.
Model	Again, three types of complexes will form.
Method	For finite oligomers, one recovers the classical description in terms of chemical equilibria, and the corresponding protonation constants can be expressed in terms of microscopic binding constants and pair interaction energies.17
Goal	First, we introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies, elucidate the differences between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems, and extend the description to macromolecular receptors.
Conclusion	In both cases, the model is able to predict all details of the microscopic equilibria, including microstate probabilities and microscopic equilibrium constants.
Background	The experimentally inclined reader is welcome to proceed to this section directly.
Model	The complex with two different metal ions involves one pair interaction energy E(12), and this interaction will be abbreviated with the parameter u12.
Model	Within this transitions, the metal ions cluster together, see Fig. 6(b).
Background	For this reason, a parameterization of these constants in terms of only a few chemically meaningful parameters is necessary.
Model	We assume that the microconstant of these sites is the same for all sites, and will be denoted by K. The inverse of this value corresponds to the microconstant for the removal of the metal ion.
Model	The macroconstant β11 is obtained by realizing that the microspecies has a symmetry number of six.
Model	The generalization of the following arguments to an arbitrary number of metal ions is straightforward.
Model	The partition function of the entire chain can be then obtained by summing over all the states of the sub-chain.
Model	The microconstants to remove each metal ion can be again evaluated by considering the affinities of the metal ions to the sites and by considering the pair interaction, and their inverse values are given in Fig. 7.
Model	In order to simplify the structure of the model, let us consider the equilibrium constant of the exchange reaction [LaLa(L2)3]6+ + [EuEu(L2)3]6+ ⇌ 2[LaEu(L2)3]6+.
Model	From this expression we find that the probability of the microspecies can be split into two terms, namely, p({si}) = π({si}|nm)Pnm(α1,α2)the macrostate probability Pnm(α1,α2), and the conditional microstate probability where the Kronecker's δn,m is unity for n = m and zero otherwise.
Model	The same complexes form with the second metal ion, when the activity of the first metal ion is small.
Conclusion	Moreover, one observes that Nd3+ is bound the weakest in the complex, Sm3+ is intermediate, and Eu3+ is bound the strongest.
Background	A classical topic, where such questions arise, are acid–base equilibria of polyelectrolytes (i.e., proton binding).
Model	Commonly, solution equilibria are described in terms of macrospecies, where only the total number and type of metal ions are specified, but it is not specified to which site they are bound.
Model	Larger structures can be enumerated on a computer, even though the number of sites accessible with this technique remains limited to about 20–30.
Model	In the other microspecies, both terminal sites are occupied.
Method	The model is solved with statistical mechanical techniques, including direct enumeration or transfer matrices.
Model	The generating and terminating vectors are given by Ṽg = (1,0,0) and Ṽt = (1,1,1).
Model	In the absence of interactions (E = 0 or u = 1), this isotherm reduces to the familiar Langmuir isotherm.
Result	This effect leads to a destabilization of the metal ions in the mixed complexes (see Fig. 12).
Model	The macroscopic formation constant β20 involves the square of the microconstant, as two metal ions are being bound, the statistical factor of 3, and the pair interaction parameter u, which is related to the pair interaction energy E by E = −kT ln u.
Model	Inserting eqn. (26) in eqn. (27) and comparing term-by-term with eqn. (8) the macroscopic binding constants βn0 follow, in agreement with Fig. 4.
Result	The example of the multi-metallic helicates did show that from a homologous series one can obtain a sufficient number of experimental quantities in order to fix the model parameters.
Model	In either situation, we have two microstates, depending on the fact whether the two terminal sites are occupied with the same metal ion or with two different ones.
Model	In the presence of two metal ions, three types of complexes form.
Model	When two metal ions bind to the receptor, there is again only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is also equivalent to the macrostate.
Background	In the early fifties, Kirkwood,13 Steiner,14 and Marcus15 had shown how to formulate a site binding model for this situation, and this approach has been extended until recently.16,17
Observation	The intermediate structure is again alternating (Fig. 6(d)).
Method	We choose pH 8 as reference.
Model	These complexes form in water according to the equilibrium 2L1H3 + xNd3+ + ySm3+ + (3 − x − y)Eu3+ ⇌ [NdxSmyEu3−x−y(L1)2]3+ + 6H+where x, y = 0, 1, 2, 3 with x + y ≤ 3 and L13− corresponds to the deprotonated ligand.
Model	To a first approximation, the effective free energy of the metal-receptor complex can be written as a general linear and quadratic expression in the state variables, namely17,21,26 where the chemical potential term can be related to the activity of metal αω as µ(ω)i = kT ln αωK(ω)i, where K(ω)i is the microscopic association constant of the center i for the metal of type ω, and kT the thermal energy.
Observation	An example of unequal interaction parameters is shown in Fig. 10.
Model	This value can be estimated from interaction of an effective charge near +2, which are obtained from ab-initio calculations,29 and calculated for the distance of 3.61 Å invoking the Coulomb law in water.
Method	Ercolani's work12 focusses exactly on this problem, as he attempts to express formation constants of multi-center complexes in terms of two intrinsic constants and symmetry numbers.
Observation	At xEu = 0.1, binary complexes not containing Eu3+ disappear, and the evolution is dominated by the complexes [Eu3(L1)2]3+, [Eu2Sm(L1)2]3+, [EuSm2(L1)2]3+ and [Sm3(L1)2]3+ (see Fig. 11(c)).
Conclusion	The present formulation certainly represents an appropriate way to treat binding of several metal ions to one type of multi-center receptor.
Model	Given the free energy of the metal–receptor complex, we can express the semi-grand canonical partition function as26where the sum extends over all possible states {si}.
Conclusion	An analogous formulation can be applicable when the receptor undergoes conformational transitions.
Model	In the absence of interactions, the isotherm has the classical sigmoidal shape in the semi-logarithmic representation.
Model	The macroscopic formation constant β10 involves a statistical factor of 3, since there are three sites on which the metal ion can bind to the receptor.
Model	To remove a metal ion from this species, the inverse microconstant involves a factor K and we eliminate a pair interaction, which involves a factor u.
Model	We have further denoted by E(ωη)ij the pair interaction energy between two metal ions ω and η occupying the sites i and j.
Observation	On the top of both figures, the binding isotherm for the first metal ion is shown as a function of its activity for fixed activities of the second metal ion.
Model	Let us now consider the second example of the linear receptor with three sites, which has two equivalent terminal sites and one central site.
Observation	We obtain three microscopic constants log K(Nd) = 10.56, log K(Sm) = 12.20, and log K(Eu) = 12.64.
Background	Let us now consider three examples.
Model	With increasing repulsive interactions, it develops a two-hump structure with an intermediate plateau at θ = 1/2.
Model	This behavior of this isotherm is shown in Fig. 5.
Model	Two macrospecies are possible, depending whether there are two metal ions of type one or of type two.
Model	The macroconstants β12 and β21 of both complexes follow by taking into account the symmetry number of three.
Observation	These conditional constants are given in Table 1, and only those will be considered further.
Model	With eqns. (23) and (5), an analytical expression of the binding isotherm of a linear chain follows θ(z) = [2 + (λ(z)/z)(1 − zu)/(1 − u + λ(z)u)]−1.
Observation	The nearest neighbor pair interaction energies are E(LaLa) = 47.5 kJ mol−1 and E(EuEu) = 69.5 kJ mol−1.
Result	Various examples to illustrate the usefulness of the model are given.
Model	The recursion relation eqn. (19) can be initiated with the partition vector for the first site Ξ1.
Conclusion	Thus, one can predict binding constants of metal complexes from a limited set of experimental data.
Model	Initially, the metal ions bind to the empty sites, and thus with the microconstant log K. Beyond the plateau, the metal ions must bind between two occupied centers.
Model	The free energy eqn. (1) is a straightforward generalization of the treatment of protonation equilibria.16,17 
Model	This case leads to two microstates.
Hypothesis	A microscopic site binding model to treat binding of several metal ions to multi-center receptors is proposed.
Model	The formation of such macrospecies can be described in terms of a chemical reaction L + nM(1) + mM(2) ⇌ LM(1)nM(2)mwhich can be characterized in terms of macroscopic cumulative equilibrium constants βnm.
Model	There are two possible microstates, when one binds one metal ion to the receptor, namely either to the terminal site or to the central site.
Model	In the case of linear chain, one can use the transfer matrix technique to obtain these results.
Model	In this situation, the state vector has only one element, and the index ω can be suppressed.
Result	At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor again fills up through the alternating full–empty configuration (Fig. 6(a)).
Model	In the situation of identical sites and nearest neighbor interactions the free energy is given by where µ is a chemical potential term, and Eij is the pair interaction energy between the sites i and j.
Model	When we remove a metal ion of the fully occupied receptor, we overcome the binding constant and two pair interactions, obtaining the inverse of Ku2. 
Method	However, as soon as multi-center complexes are being considered, the number of constants becomes very large, and this approach becomes impractical.
Result	The off-diagonal pair interaction turns out to be E(ωη) = 19.4 kJ mol−1 (ω ≠ η) and recall that we set E(ωω) = 18.7 kJ mol−1.
Background	Researchers have focussed on the preparation and structural characterization of sophisticated metallo-supramolecular architectures, which can be obtained in high-yield by the simple mixing of the various components (i.e., self-assembly).2
Model	There are three nonequivalent microstates, each of which has a symmetry number of two.
Background	Again, such systems cannot be described by a small number of complexation constants, and an alternative approach is needed.
Model	The total concentration of the three metals was set to 0.1 M and the overall mole fraction xEu of the Eu3+-ion was fixed.
Model	Adopting this notation, we assume that the sites are numbered from the left to the right.
Model	Thereby, one introduces a recursion relation between the partition function of a chain with n sites and with n + 1.
Model	Again, by equating the coefficients of eqn. (32) with eqn. (8) one obtains the macroscopic binding constants βnm, as shown in Figs. 4 and 8.
Model	These include microscopic binding constants for both metal ions to the terminal site K(La)t and K(Eu)t and to the central site K(La)c and K(Eu)c.
Model	These six parameters can be extracted from the nine constants given in Table 2.
Model	The latter can be obtained by expanding the partition function in terms of the activities a1 and a2, and as the result one obtains the binding polynomial.
Model	Each macrospecies normally corresponds to a collection of several microspecies.
Background	However, the thermodynamic basis of the formation mechanisms of such complexes is poorly understood, and has not been addressed in much detail so far.
Model	They have to overcome two pair interactions, and thus bind with a microconstant of log K − 2ε. 
Conclusion	Further experimental data sets are necessary to settle such questions in detail.
Model	The solution can be expressed in terms of the solution of the linear chain for a single metal ion.
Model	The location of these humps is simply understood.
Model	By arranging the elements of the restricted partition function Ξn(s) into a column vector Ξn, the transfer matrix T can be defined as Ξn + 1 = TΞn.
Model	Alternatively, both metal ions occupy the terminal sites.
Model	Once the site is occupied with a metal ion, it can no longer bind any others.
Background	The latter bottom-up process necessitates an exploitation and modelling of the experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on complexation reactions.
Conclusion	This observation is consistent with NMR results, since the two minority complexes could not be detected.8 
Model	The site binding model now contains the following parameters.
Result	Predictive capabilities of the site binding model were illustrated with the inositol complexes.
Method	This parameterization appears to be the appropriate one to obtain the necessary simplification of the description of acid–base equilibria of polyprotic acids or bases.18–20 
Model	Consider two metal ions and assume nearest neighbor interactions.
Model	From this expression, the probability of a macrospecies, or in other words its relative concentration, can be expressed as.
Model	For this reason, we set the diagonal term E(ωω) = 18.7 kJ mol−1.
Background	For example, dendrimers have been reported to complex several hundreds of copper(ii) ions.22
Model	The site binding model introduces three microscopic binding constants K(Nd), K(Sm) and K(Eu) and six pair interaction energies E(ωη).
Model	With this value, the model contains four adjustable parameters, which we extract by non-linear least squares fit from the constants of the nine complexes containing one or two different metal ions (see Table 1).
Model	The macroconstant β30 for the fully occupied receptor involves the cube of the microconstant, three pair interactions, and no statistical factor.
Model	As will be discussed in the following, transfer matrices have simple forms for nearest neighbor pair interactions.
Model	When three metal ions are bound, two sites are occupied by one type of the metal ion, and the remaining site with the second type.
Model	The macroconstant β10 is given by three times the microconstant K, since each species contributes in the same way.
Model	From these macrospecies probabilities, the binding isotherms can be directly obtained as.
Model	These expressions reflect the basic fact that the overall binding isotherms depend on the probabilities of the corresponding macrostates.
Result	The same trend can be also observed for Eu3+, as its binding is also weakened by the presence of neighboring La3+ ions.
Object	In the last section the applicability of the model to experimental binding constants is illustrated.
Observation	The binding isotherm of the second metal shows an interesting transition region, as the isotherm becomes steep in the intermediate activity regime.
Model	The cross term E(LaEu) is obtained from eqn. (42).
Model	Note that the previously introduced binding constant K(λ)j corresponds to the inverse of the microconstant for the release of a metal of type λ from site j when all other sites of the receptor are empty.
Background	We note that the complexes [La2(L3)3]6+ and [Eu2(L3)3]6+ have been also described, but their structure is probably rather different, and they are not considered here.7 
Model	The off-diagonal terms are now simply approximated by an arithmetic average of the corresponding diagonal terms.
Model	The binding isotherm for the metal ω and center i can be written as a thermal average over the state variable, namelywhere the thermal average of a function f({si}) is defined as.
Model	Complexes will form only with the first metal ion, provided the activity of the second metal ions is small, see Fig. 3.
Model	Equilibrium constants of microscopic equilibria can be discussed in this framework as well.
Model	Since all the sites are equivalent, there is only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is equivalent to the macrostate.
Model	This microspecies invokes a nearest neighbor pair interaction, denoted by the parameter u, and the square of the microconstants.
Background	This paper is structured as follows.
Model	The partition functions can be evaluated by inserting these quantities into eqn. (22).
Model	Consider now a chemical equilibrium between two species L({s′i}) ⇌ L({si})the state vectors of which are identical with the exception of the elements sj(λ)j = 0 and s′(λ)j = 1.
Observation	For the central site we have log K(La)c = 17.91 and log K(EuEu)c = 21.08.
Model	However, it is usually more practical to generate this restricted partition function by the application of the transfer matrix to a suitably chosen generating vector Vg such that Ξ1 = TVg.
Model	For the matter of illustration, let us assume that the affinity of the terminal and central sites are the same.
Result	At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor fills up through the alternating full-empty configuration discussed above, see Fig. 6(a).
Background	These aspects will be the subject of future studies.
Object	The first example is the symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites.
Observation	The macrostate probabilities, which are normalized to the total concentration of the saturated complexes, are shown in Fig. 13a.
Model	Let us now consider the long chain limit as the last example.
Method	The formation of metal–ligand complexes can be quantified in terms of chemical equilibria and the corresponding complexation constants.
Model	The situation of a symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites is simple to discuss, see Fig. 3.
Model	Due to symmetry, the microspecies are again equivalent to the macrospecies.
Model	The state of all sites can be then described with a state vector si.
Model	There is one complex involving three metal ions, with one from one kind and two from the other kind.
Model	The formation constants to be analyzed are summarized in Table 2.
Background	Such charged macromolecules have linear or branched structures, and offer a large number of coordination sites.
Model	The inverse values of the various microconstants to remove the respective metal ions are also indicated.
Conclusion	This result can be considered as very satisfactory, since the model was calibrated on binary systems only.
Goal	To test the predictive capabilities of the model, we have calculated the constant of the ternary complex [NdSmEu(L1)2]3+ (see Table 1).
Model	In other words, the pair interaction energies obey the mixing rule.
Method	The free energy of a microscopic protonation state is expressed in terms of a small number of parameters.
Model	To remove a metal ion, there are two different microconstants as the terminal site involves only one pair interaction, and the central one two.
Model	In the first species, one terminal site and one central site are occupied.
Object	In this publication, we develop this topic further and discuss a site binding model to describe binding of different metal ions to a multi-center receptor with well-defined binding sites, see Fig. 1.
Model	In order to apply the site binding model, which treats the binding of metal ions to one receptor, we consider the conditional equilibrium 2L1tot + xNd3+ + ySm3+ + (3 − x − y)Eu3+ ⇌ [NdxSmyEu3−x−y(L1)2]3+where L1tot refers to all solution species of the ligand.
Conclusion	While for multi-metallic helicates a simple mixing rule appears to represent a reasonable approximation of the off-diagonal elements of the matrix, for the inositol complexes deviations from this rule are observed.
Object	Multi-center complexes of lanthanides provide good examples for the mechanisms discussed here.
Model	In particular, the latter can be used to address systems in the limit of large number of sites in a straightforward fashion.
Observation	On the bottom, the isotherm for the second metal is shown in the same representation.
Conclusion	In the protein literature,30 this problem is referred to as aggregation of ligands, but a useful parameterization of this problem is not known.
Observation	For the situation shown in Fig. 9 a random structure forms (E = 0), while in the one shown in Fig. 10 the alternating structure forms (E = 15 kJ mol−1 > 0).
Conclusion	Naturally, once the macroscopic constants are known, the macrostate probabilities can be computed (see Fig. 11).
Observation	Fig. 13 shows the macroscopic properties of the trimetallic helicates with the formula [LaxEu3−x(L3)3]9+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3).
Background	The partial rationalization of the formation of the heterobimetallic and trimetallic complexes represents a first step toward this goal.6–11
Result	Fig. 14 summarizes their microscopic properties.
Model	A microspecies is defined with a set of given state variable vectors {si}.
Result	Independent fit of the off-diagonal terms gives a value of the off-diagonal terms, which is very close to the value predicted by the mixing rule eqn. (42), and leads to no improvement to the fit.
Result	As the concentration ratio [Eu3+]/[La3+] is increased, one goes through the characteristic sequence of the macrospecies [La3(L3)3]9+, [La2Eu(L3)3]9+, [LaEu2(L3)3]9+ and [Eu3(L3)3]9+.
Background	This situation is completely analogous to the situation of proton binding discussed in detail elsewhere.14–17
Model	The receptor fully occupied with metal ions invokes two nearest neighbor pair interactions, and thus invokes a factor u2.
Model	For example, for a chain with three sites (N = 3) one obtains Ξ = 1 + 3z + (1 + 2u)z2 + u2z3.
Model	Note that this mixing rule imposes no effective interactions in the saturated state (cf. eqn. (36)).
Model	This conditional probability expresses the relative probability to find a given microstate within a particular macrostate.
Object	Let us now present the treatment of two types of metal ions using the three examples already discussed.
Background	In the past, research mainly focussed on mono-center complexes containing a single metal ion and one or more ligands.
Conclusion	However, the parameters considered must be interpreted as thermal averages over the different conformational states.
Method	Normally, these include microscopic binding constants for each site and site–site pair interaction energies.
Background	Nevertheless, it is important to understand this case for our discussion of the multicomponent case.
Result	We obtain microscopic and macroscopic complexation constants, microstate probabilities, and binding isotherms for chain-like receptors, including the long-chain limit.
Model	The second example involves a linear receptor, with two equivalent terminal sites, and one central site, see Fig. 4.
Conclusion	The model therefore captures the interactions between the different lanthanide ions properly.
Model	This reaction corresponds to a microscopic equilibrium, where the site j eliminates a metal of type λ, but the binding state of the rest of receptor remains unchanged.
Background	Interactions of metal ions with ligands represent an important topic in coordination chemistry.
Model	The microscopic binding constant to bind a metal ion to the site will be denoted as K, which is the inverse of the microconstant to remove it.
Object	The receptor may consist of several preassembled ligands.
Background	For this reason, a few major features will be summarized here.
Model	The binding isotherms are then obtained from eqn. (5).
Conclusion	In this paper, we have presented a microscopic site binding model treating binding of several metal ions to preassembled multi-center receptors with well-defined binding sites within a statistical mechanical framework.
Model	However, an analytical solution is possible if we specialize to the important case of equal pair interactions, namely u11 = u12 = u22 = u.
Background	From this model description, we can extract various properties of interest.
Result	For each mixed complex (macrospecies), there are two possible structures (microspecies), each of which has always a fixed relative fraction within the macrostate.
Model	In long chain limit, the largest eigenvalue cannot be evaluated analytically in the general case.
Model	The inverse microconstant for removing a metal ion involves the binding constant K and one pair interaction u.
Model	With attractive interactions, a sharp transition takes place.
Model	For example, the long chain limit is typically dominated with the largest eigenvalue λ of the transfer matrix T.
Result	The experimental equilibrium constants can be described with the site binding model extremely well (see Table 2).
Model	As will be exemplified below, the advantage of introducing this vector is its simple structure.
Observation	The results for the analytically soluble case with equal interaction parameters are shown in Fig. 9.
Model	To analyze the formation constants, we assume that the bimetallic and trimetallic complexes have equal interactions, and thus we use the whole series to extract the microscopic parameters.
Hypothesis	The model introduces the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.
Model	Since only the complexes with three lanthanide ions exist, one cannot estimate both interaction energies independently.
Result	One observes that the terminal metal ions are much more tightly bound that the central ones.
Model	Due to Coulombic forces between charged metal ions, the interactions are repulsive and Eij > 0.
Background	One encounters a similar problem, when one attempts to interpret the binding of metal ions by polyelectrolytes.21–25
Model	We simplify the interaction energy matrix further by assuming that the diagonal elements E(ωω) and off-diagonal elements E(ωη) (ω ≠ η) are the same, respectively, leaving us with two pair interaction energies to be determined.
Conclusion	In both situations, we find that consideration of pair interactions is important to obtain an acceptable description of the data.
Result	The normalized activity now is z = z1u212/(z2u222) for the first metal ion.
Result	The microscopic picture is very simple in this case, as each macrostate consists of a single microstate (see Fig. 12).
Model	Larger systems can be either treated by Monte Carlo simulation, or certain structures by transfer matrix techniques.27
Model	Based on the present description, one can obtain expressions for equilibrium constants for the chemical equilibria between different species.
Object	Statistical mechanical approach to competitive binding of metal ions to multi-center receptors
Result	The experimental value of its common logarithm is 25.90 and the model predicts 25.98.
Model	The microconstants follow as above.
Observation	At high activities of the second metal ion, the second metal exchanges with the first one.
Model	Based on this formulation, many properties of finite and infinite chains can be obtained in a straightforward way.
Model	For example, the trimer (N = 3) is now described with a partition function.
Conclusion	Moreover, more long-range interactions and eventually higher order interactions (e.g., triplets) must be considered.
Conclusion	However, the general structure of the pair interaction matrix is not obvious at this point.
Background	The recent design of heterometallic f–f′ complexes evidencing large deviations from statistical distributions in solution demonstrates the need for mathematical models of multi-center complexation processes.5
Background	The first two concern small receptors, and the last one the infinite linear chain.
Result	However, as the pair interaction energies between different metal ions are somewhat larger than between the same metal ions, the microscopic constants increase with increasing number of different neighboring metal ions.
Model	Different binding states of receptors with a small number of sites can be enumerated by hand.
Model	Again, this operation can be formulated in a matrix notation, by defining a terminating vector Vt.
Model	This model is equivalent to the so-called Ising model, which is amply discussed in the statistical mechanics literature.27
Observation	In the absence of Eu3+, one observes the classical evolution from the [Nd3(L1)2]3+ complex, through the mixed binary complexes [Nd2Sm(L1)2]3+ and [NdSm2(L1)2]3+, to the [Sm3(L1)2]3+ complex (see Fig. 11(a)).
Model	This exchange constant has been shown to be 4 within experimental error,7 meaning that the fraction in eqn. (41) can be well approximated by unity.
Model	In the absence of interactions, this isotherm reduces to the competitive Langmuir isotherm.
Model	The successive equilibrium constant for the reaction eqn. (16) can be obtained from the free energy difference of these states, and yields the result.
Model	The partition function can be now written in a compact fashion as Ξ = ṼtTNVg.
Model	For repulsive interactions, the first hump in the binding isotherm is located at log a = log K, while the second hump at log a = log K −2ε where ε = −log10u = E/(kTln10).
Model	From these considerations, we obtain the conditional microstate probabilities and the macroconstants shown in Fig. 4.
Object	As a second example, consider the monometallic and bimetallic helicates of the general formula [LaxEuy(L2)3]3(x+y)+ (x, y = 0, 1, 2) and trimetallic helicates of the formula [LaxEu3−x(L3)3]9+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, see Fig. 1 and 2).7,8
Model	This complex involves three pair interactions, namely one between the same metal ions, and two between different ones.
Model	Complexes with the first metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the second metal ion, complexes with the second metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the first metal ion, and mixed complexes.
Model	The important advantage of introducing this conditional probability is that this quantity is a constant and independent of the metal activities.
Result	One observes that the exchange between Eu3+ and La3+ occurs in a relatively narrow concentration range.
Conclusion	On the other hand, when the complexes contain different numbers of sub-units, the present approach must be generalized in order to incorporate this situation.
Background	Note that this isotherm is identical to the case of proton binding to a polyelectrolyte.15,16,21
Model	Usually this vector contains unit entries, and one can write eqn. (20) as a scalar product Ξ = ṼtΞNwhere Ṽt denotes the transposed (row) vector.
Conclusion	As long as all complexes are composed of the same number of ligands (e.g., helicates) the present approach applies.
Observation	Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the main features of these isotherms.
Result	The applicability of the model has been illustrated with examples of lanthanide complexes, namely mixed trimetallic cis-inositol complexes and multi-metallic helicates.
Model	If a metal ion of type ω is bound to a site i, the corresponding element of the state vector s(ω)i is defined to be unity, and all the other elements are zero.
Model	These three microspecies have to be considered, when the macroconstant β11 of the complex with two different metal ions is evaluated.
Result	As a consequence, a disordered intermediate structure is formed (Fig. 6(c)).
Model	The microconstant to remove a metal ion is now given by the inverse of K. Summing up the contributions of both species, we thus find the macroconstant β20 and the conditional probabilities of each microspecies.
Result	This situation is illustrated with linear chains.
Model	Note that the pair interaction energy is symmetric upon exchange of the indices ω and η, as well as i and j.
Object	The model will be first discussed with simple examples, including small and infinitely large receptors.
Model	Either one metal ion occupies the central site, and a nearest neighbor pair interaction has to be considered in this case.
Conclusion	This effect is mainly caused by the additional electrostatic repulsion between the sites.
Model	The probability of such a species (i.e., its relative concentration) can be written as.
Model	For this species, which has a symmetry number of 2, it may be necessary to consider the typically weaker next neighbor pair interaction.
Observation	Fig. 13(b) shows the relative fraction of metal bound in the trimetallic helicates.
Result	The resulting parameters are the microscopic constants for the terminal sites log K(La)t = 16.70 and log K(Eu)t = 19.10.
Model	The intermediate plateau originates from the stabilization of an intermediate structure, where a bound metal ion alternates with an empty site, see Fig. 6(a).
Result	At high activities of the second metal ion, on the other hand, the second metal exchanges with the first one following an effective repulsive interaction between both metal ions, and leading to an intermediate plateau.
Model	The transfer matrix formalism can be extended to competitive metal binding to linear receptors in a straightforward fashion.
Model	However, this interaction will be neglected here.
Object	For this reason, we shall focus on those, but applications to other complexes should be envisioned as well.
Background	Polyelectrolytes may therefore bind a larger number of metal ions.
Model	In the case of a single metal ion, equivalent sites, and nearest neighbor interactions, the transfer matrix is given by16,21,27 where we have introduced the reduced activity z = αK.The two supplementary (transposed) partition vectors are Ṽg = (1,0) and Ṽt = (1, 1).
Model	These isotherms obey the thermodynamic consistency relation 
Model	In the general case, when u11 ≠ u12 ≠ u22 the isotherm can be found numerically by evaluating the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.
Model	The overall binding fraction of the metal ω can be expressed aswhere N is the total number of sites of the receptor.

Result	Nevertheless, the specimens with Pt electrodes also exhibited a conductivity increase for Fe content of 5 × 1018 cm−3 and decrease for 5 × 1019 cm−3.
Result	Besides quite different relaxation behaviors between YBa2Cu3O6+δ and Pt electrodes, which will be detailed elsewhere, the absolute magnitudes of the conductivity of the same Fe content were not in exact agreement with each other (Fig. 6).
Observation	The detrapping induced by water incorporation and corresponding increase in [OH˙O] and [h˙] is thus more pronounced in the higher Fe contents and a more distinct transition between two PH2O regimes results in SrTiO3 with lower Fe content as similarly seen in the case of fixed-valence dopants (see also Fig. 1).
Object	As well as the powder compact specimens in Fig. 2, sintered pellets were also investigated.
Background	They are improved parameters from those reported in refs. 7 and 11.
Experiment	Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out with a magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm, Germany, resolution 2 μg).
Observation	Similarly KH2O values at different temperatures were obtained as represented in Fig. 4.
Observation	[Fe′Ti], which is only a few tenths of mFe at low PH2O, increases with PH2O until saturated to mFe.
Observation	In Fig. 6 the calculated (total) conductivity (σT) is compared with the experimental values.
Method	The change in the ratio Fe3+/Fe4+ with water incorporation was also monitored by optical spectroscopy.21
Experiment	The buoyancy effect was corrected by dummy measurements.
Background	The water incorporation into these vacancy-dominated oxides introduces protons as hydroxide defects as follows:2where KH2O is the mass action constant for hydration.
Background	The presence of proton, oxygen ion and electronic carriers is interesting for catalysis and also favorable for a partially self-regulated fuel cell concept.6
Result	Despite the much smaller concentration of holes compared to the ionic defects, the conductivity is mainly electronic at 475 °C and 1 atm dry oxygen atmosphere due to the high hole mobility.
Observation	The weight change decreases with increasing temperatures; high water vapor pressures of 20 and 100 mbar were used for measurements at 600 °C in order to obtain measurable mass changes.
Observation	Fig. 5 shows the electrical conductivity change in single crystals with different Fe concentrations, 5 × 1018 (in open circles) and 5 × 1019 cm−3 (in solid squares), respectively, upon a stepwise introduction of water vapor of 20 mbar at 475 °C under 1 atm PO2.
Experiment	For each doping content, two specimens with different electrode configurations were prepared: YBa2Cu3O6+δ films on the large area surfaces (6 × 6 mm2); and Pt paste on the small area surfaces (6 × 1 mm2).
Observation	The measurement of the sintered pellet showed that there is not a significant amount of adsorbed water at the surface of powder specimens.
Observation	Along with increasing [Fe′Ti], the concentration of the major counter-charge defects, [OH˙O] increases.
Background	Fe-doped SrTiO3 may be used as a model mixed conducting perovskite system to develop an accurate description of the thermodynamics and kinetics of water incorporation, since the thermodynamic parameters in oxygen incorporation and in intrinsic redox reactions are well established7–10 (see Table 1).
Observation	Not only the difference in the hydration enthalpy, but, more significantly, a difference by more than one order of magnitude in the absolute magnitude of hydration constants are indicated.
Observation	The presence of the two PH2O regimes described above is a general defect situation but the consequence of the change in the effective dopant concentration [Fe′Ti] between the two regimes should be noted.
Observation	The increase beyond the point at which most of the V˙˙O present in the low PH2O have been occupied occurs by the redox reaction:which is facilitated by the valence change of iron dopant Fe4+ to Fe3+.
Result	From an Arrhenius fit, a hydration enthalpy, ΔHH2O°, of −60 ± 12 kJ mol−1 (−0.63 ± 0.13 eV) and a hydration entropy, ΔSH2O°, of −122 ± 9 J mol−1 K−1 (−0.0013 ± 0.0001 eV K−1), were estimated.
Model	Then using the electroneutrality condition:[Fe′Ti] = 2[V˙˙O] + [OH˙O] + [h˙].the defect concentrations can be computed from eqns (1)–(3) as a function of PO2, PH2O, and T.
Background	In previous studies of water incorporation in Fe-doped SrTiO3, the iron ions on Ti sites were assumed to have a fixed +3 valency.14–16
Model	In the case of fixed-valence acceptors (A), 2[V˙˙O] + [OH˙O] ≅ [A′Ti], the increase of proton concentration corresponds to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration, i.e. Δ[OH˙O] ≅ −2Δ[V˙˙O].
Experiment	The samples were loaded into a small alumina crucible, which was connected to the balance via platinum wire and a quartz rod.
Model	When the effective dopant concentration significantly increases with water incorporation, [Fe′Ti]wet > [Fe′Ti]dry ≅ 2[V˙˙O]dry, eqn (10), rather than eqn (9), gives more accurate estimates.
Goal	In the present study we performed a defect chemical analysis considering the possible change of the ratio Fe3+/Fe4+ with water vapor pressure as well as with temperature and oxygen partial pressure.
Object	Formation of protonic defects in perovskite-type oxides with redox-active acceptors: case study on Fe-doped SrTiO3
Model	Neglecting proton concentration in nominally dry gas (PH2O < 10 Pa) [OH˙O]wet ≅ Δ[OH˙O].
Result	It should be noted that the enhanced proton solubility due to the redox-active Fe dopants is experimentally observable in the viable water pressure range e.g. 0 to 20 mbar PH2O.
Conclusion	The slight increase in the conductivity of the higher dopant specimen in Fig. 6 can thus be ascribed to the stronger increase in proton conductivity overcompensating the moderated decrease in hole conductivity due to the increase in Fe3+/Fe4+ ratio.
Observation	Under ‘dry’ conditions (PH2O < 10 Pa), the acceptors [Fe′Ti] (or [A′Ti]) are largely compensated by oxygen vacancies viz., [Fe′Ti] ≅ 2[V˙˙O], and the concentration of the minority protonic defects [OH˙O] increases as according to eqn (1).
Result	In the following sections, we will show some consequences of this on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Fe-doped SrTiO3 in water vapor.
Result	The specimens with Pt electrodes on the small surface sides showed perceptible electrode contributions in the low frequency range separated from the high frequency response from which the bulk conductivity was obtained.
Background	Kreuer et al22. showed that the formation of protonic defects is very sensitive to the choice of acceptor dopant in BaZrO3.
Experiment	Fe-doped SrTiO3 single crystal (100) plates (6 × 6 × 1 mm3) with doping contents (mFe) of 5 × 1018 and 5 × 1019 cm−3 (Frank & Schulte GmbH, Essen, Germany) were used to measure the conductivity variation with water incorporation at 475 °C at 1 atm PO2.
Observation	Figs. 1a and c represent the cases of fixed valence dopants A′Ti in amounts corresponding to [Fe′Ti] values of low PH2O and at high PH2O, respectively.
Observation	The total conductivity is the sum of partial conductivities of holes (σh), oxygen ions (σO), and protons(σH).
Model	The weight change measured by thermogravimetry is used to obtain [V˙˙O]wet:where MO atomic mass of oxygen and hydrogen mass is neglected (cf. eqn (8)).
Experiment	The specimens were first equilibrated in a dry atmosphere (102 or 103 ppm O2 balanced with Ar) and then water vapor is introduced using mixture of dry gas and wet gas (20 mbar H2O) High vapor pressures above 20 mbar were obtained by employing a tubing pump (Isamatec, Switzerland) and a custom-made evaporator.
Conclusion	The defect model that also takes account of redox changes with water incorporation satisfactorily described the conductivity behavior of SrTiO3 single crystals with different Fe content in water incorporation.
Result	The hydration enthalpies and entropies were −60 kJ mol−1 and −122 J mol−1 K−1.
Observation	[Fe′Ti]wet can be estimated from [V˙˙O]wet, the experimental parameters (mFe, PO2), and known parameters of KO2 and KFe:The symbols in Fig. 3 thus represent defect concentrations that are estimated from the thermogravimetric measurements in Fig. 2 using known mass action constants KO2 and KFe (Table 1).
Result	The difference may be due to the different experimental parameters in the respective studies (isobaric thermogravimetry and high vapor pressure of 1 atm in ref. 22) and/or may indicate a significant difference in the thermodynamics in water incorporation between Sc-doped SrTiO3 and Fe-doped SrTiO3.
Model	The defect chemical analysis in this study refers to oxidizing atmosphere, in which possible reduced hydrogen species14–18 are not concerned, and OH˙O according to eqn (1) is the only hydrogen species to be considered.
Experiment	Impedance response was recorded using a LCR meter (4248A, Hewlett-Packard, USA).
Background	The defect concentrations are estimated from mass action constants including KH2O of the present study.
Conclusion	The hydration enthalpy and entropy were estimated to be −60 ± 12 kJ mol−1 and −122 ± 9 J mol−1 K−1, respectively.
Experiment	The oxygen and water partial pressure were monitored by a zirconia sensor (Cambridge Sensotec, UK) and a hygrometer (Panametrics, UK).
Background	The electron transition in eqn (2) is the predominant optical excitation process in the visible range and the ‘color’ of the specimens represents the distribution of redox states (Fe3+/Fe4+).8,11–13
Model	Fig. 1b shows the simulated defect concentrations as a function of PH2O in the logarithmic scale (top) and in the linear scale (bottom) for mFe = 1020 cm−3, T = 400 °C and PO2 = 1 atm, using the mass action constants from the literature and the hydration constant obtained in this study (which will be described later) (Table 1).
Background	Proton diffusivity in ref. 25, 7.9 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 e−0.41 eV/kT, is used which was obtained in Sc-doped SrTiO3.
Result	With increasing water vapor pressures the proton conductivity becomes an appreciable part of the total conductivity.
Observation	At very high water vapor pressure, most of the oxygen vacancies are occupied by hydroxide ions so that the dopants [Fe′Ti] (or [A′Ti]) are now largely compensated by the protonic defects, [Fe′Ti] ≅ [OH˙O], whereby the concentrations of the minority defects [V˙˙O] and [h˙] decrease as and , respectively.
Observation	In Fig. 4, the results of Sc-doped SrTiO322 are compared.
Background	Many perovskite-type oxides (ABO3, A = Sr, Ba, B = Ce, Zr, Ti) doped with acceptors, e.g., Gd, Y, and Sc, have been reported to exhibit high proton conductivity in humid atmospheres.1
Model	The concentration of excess electrons [e′] (=KB[h˙]−1) is negligible under these conditions and oxygen incorporation into the vacancy-dominated oxides introducing electronic holes is considered:The valence states of Fe dopants introduced by eqn (2), neglecting Fe2+ observed in strongly reducing atmosphere,19 give[Fe′Ti] + [FeTi×] = mFe = Constant,where mFe is the total Fe concentration.
Model	The mass action constant of hydration in eqn (1) can be written asWhen the water vapor pressure change leads to a significant change in effective dopant concentration [Fe′Ti], as shown in Fig. 1, Δ[OH˙O] ≅ [OH˙O]wet = [Fe′Ti]wet − 2[V˙˙O]wet according to the electroneutrality condition.
Conclusion	The defect chemical model was applied to describe the water vapor dependence of the electrical conductivity in mixed ionic and electronic conducting Fe-doped SrTiO3 single crystals.
Observation	The change in the effective dopant concentration [Fe′Ti] with PH2O for given PO2 and T according to eqn (6) should be noted.
Result	The calculations are not exactly consistent with the measurements but the difference between the two specimens is semi-quantitatively explained.
Observation	The averaged KH2O value was found to be 2.83 × 1015 Pa−1cm−3.
Result	According to the simulation, both specimens possess a significant proton contribution of ∼6% in the total conductivity at 20 mbar PH2O.
Result	Some of these are comparable to our value (−60 ± 12 kJ mol−1) and some smaller (in absolute magnitude).
Method	Changes in valence states of redox-active dopant ions (Fe3+/Fe4+) with water vapor pressure were taken into account in the defect chemical analysis.
Observation	The weight change of the strontium titanate powder compact was monitored as the water vapor pressure changed stepwise from ∼0 mbar (dry gas) to 4 mbar and to 20 mbar and then back to 0 mbar at 450 °C.
Observation	The conductivity of the specimen with the lower Fe content decreased upon water incorporation by ∼22%, while that with the higher Fe content slightly increased (∼3%).
Model	In the temperature range of concern (>400 °C) associates of acceptors [Fe′Ti] with oxygen vacancies such as {Fe′Ti V˙˙O} 20 or with protonic defects {Fe′Ti OH˙O}16 are negligible.
Background	Kinetic parameters are taken from the literature: hole mobility 7.5 × 103(T/K)−1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and vacancy mobility 3.0 × 103 (T/K)−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 e−0.86 eV/kT in Fe-doped SrTiO3 from .ref. 24
Result	The proton mobility may be sensitive to the acceptor dopants as shown in BaZrO3,22 however, similarly with the proton formation energetics.
Observation	Fig. 4 showed that all of the data fall roughly on a line regardless of the oxygen partial pressures, the water vapor pressure ranges, and the sample types.
Background	The equilibrium concentrations of defects responsible for the transport properties in the mixed conducting perovskites depend on both oxygen and water vapor partial pressures as well as on temperatures.
Background	Cherry et al23. calculated −69 kJ mol−1 for pure SrTiO3 by atomistic simulation methods.
Model	Thus the mass action constant of hydration can be expressed as
Observation	The lines then represent the calculated concentration using the complete set of mass action constants including KH2O.
Object	The thermodynamics of water incorporation into Fe-doped SrTiO3 was investigated by thermogravimetric measurements.
Background	Waser16 found ΔH°H2O values of −46 kJ mol−1 for undoped SrTiO3 and −29 kJ mol−1 for a Fe-doped SrTiO3 (0.3 mol%) by IR spectroscopy.
Observation	The data in Fig. 5 were obtained using highly reversible YBa2Cu3O6+δ electrodes on large surfaces of the plate specimens; the spectra exhibited only bulk semicircular responses from which the conductivity was estimated.
Experiment	2.3 g.
Experiment	The specimens for thermogravimetry were powder compacts (prepared by cold isostatic pressing) and sintered pellets (1450 °C for 8 h in N2) for respective batches of ca.
Observation	It should be noted that the degree of trapping and thus also the Fe4+ to Fe3+ concentration ratio is higher for the higher Fe concentration in SrTiO3.
Conclusion	The thermogravimetric measurements on the water incorporation in Fe-doped SrTiO3 were analyzed considering the redistribution of the valence states of Fe dopants.
Background	In Fe-doped SrTiO3 the dopant is redox-activeThe ‘association’ between negatively charged Fe3+ defects and the holes to form Fe4+ becomes increasingly thermodynamically favorable as temperature falls (exothermic association) and as oxygen partial pressure increases (oxidation).11
Experiment	For the thermogravimetric measurements 1 mol% Fe-doped SrTiO3 specimens were prepared by conventional ceramic processing.
Background	Besides proton electrolytes with high and prevailing protonic conductivity, mixed conductors exhibiting both electronic and protonic conductivity are of considerable interest in view of potential applications as hydrogen separation membranes or electrodes.1,3–5
Experiment	A mixture of SrCO3 (99.996%, ABCR, Germany), TiO2 (99.9%, Aldrich, USA) and Fe2O3 (99.9%, Ventron, India) was wet-milled and calcined twice (at 1250 and 1300 °C for 1 h).
Observation	Considering the buoyancy effect of ∼15 μg from the dummy measurement, the weight change of the specimen was ∼1.1 × 102 μg at 20 mbar PH2O.
Experiment	The X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the formation of the single SrTiO3 phase.
Observation	The reaction (7) represents proton incorporation but, in contrast to reaction (1), not water incorporation.
Background	Kreuer et al22. obtained −23 kJ mol−1 for Sc-doped SrTiO3 (2 mol% Sc) from a hydration isobar at 1 atm PH2O by thermogravimetry.
Result	The proton solubility was significantly enhanced by the presence of the redox centers.
Observation	The bottom graphs in Fig. 6 represent defect concentrations in linear scale in which variations in [Fe′Ti] can be clearly seen (the dashed lines indicate PH2O region in the upper graphs).
Model	The effective acceptor concentration, e.g.[Fe′Ti], follows from[Fe′Ti]3 + (B − 2A)[Fe′Ti]2 + (4mFeA − mFeB)[Fe′Ti] − 2m2FeA = 0where and .
Model	This quantity can be obtained from the thermogravimetric results according towith w and Δw being sample weight and weight change, MH2O molecular mass of water and MSTO molar mass of SrTiO3.
Observation	Fig. 2 shows an example of thermogravimetric measurements.
Result	Consequently the protonic defects OH˙O incorporated by water vapor exceed twice the consumed vacancies, as represented more generally by Δ[OH˙O] ≅ −2Δ[V˙˙O] + Δ[Fe′Ti], according to the electroneutrality equation (see the bottom graphs of Fig. 1).

Experiment	The pressure in the cell was measured with a capacitance manometer connected at the entrance of the cell.
Observation	For 3-methyl-2-butanol, our value of k3 at room temperature agrees with that reported earlier by Wallington et al. obtained using the flash photolysis–resonance fluorescence technique (k3 = (12.4±0.7) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1).6
Model	The concentrations of the reactants were calculated from their mass flow rates, the temperature, and the pressure in the reaction cell.
Observation	The obtained values of k1–k3 and the experimental conditions are listed in table 2.
Model	The rate of disappearance of the OH radical followed a simple exponential rate law:[OH]t = [OH]0e−k′t where k′ = ki [alcohol] + k′0ki represents the rate constants for the reaction of OH with the three alcohols.
Model	Relative rate constants were measured by comparing the OH reaction rate with alcohols to that with reference compounds:OH + alcohol → products: kalcoholOH + reference → products: krefAssuming that the compounds are only consumed by reaction with OH, it can be shown that:ln([alcohol]0/[alcohol]t) = (kalcohol/kref)ln([ref]0/[ref]t)where the subscripts 0 and t indicate concentrations before irradiation and at time t, respectively.
Observation	In Table 1, the obtained rate constant ratios are given along with the derived rate constants for the OH reactions with the three alcohols.
Result	While averaging the values from different experiments, we obtained:k1 = (0.92 ± 0.15) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.k2 = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.k3 = (1.25 ± 0.2) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.The quoted errors represent twice the standard deviation, to which we have added an estimated error of 10% on the reference rate constants.
Experiment	The photoreactor was then filled to its full capacity at atmospheric pressure with ultra-pure air.
Experiment	2-methyl-1-propanol (≥99.8 %), 3-methyl-1-butanol (≥99.5) and 3-methyl-2-butanol (≥99.5%) were from Fluka, they were further purified by repeated freeze, pump, and thaw cycles and fractional distillation before use.
Background	In all cases, the resulting reaction is an abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the oxygenated substrate.
Motivation	To assess the impact of these chemical species on the environment, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of their atmospheric degradation is required.
Conclusion	These values are in good agreement with those obtained by the relative method.
Background	The contribution of the reaction of OH with photofragments of alcohol was negligible since alcohols are not photolysed at 248 nm,10 the wavelength used to generate OH radicals.
Background	The release of these oxygenated volatile organic compounds is likely to contribute to the formation of ozone and other components of photochemical smog such as aldehydes, ketones and PAN-type compounds in urban areas.
Result	An un-weighted least squares analysis of the ln kivs. 1/T plot yields the following expressions for the temperature dependence of k1–k3 in the temperature range 241–373 K (in units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1 ):k1 = (3.1±0.9) × 10−12exp[(352±82)/T]k2 = (2.8±0.9) × 10−12exp[(503±98)/T]k3 = (2.6±0.6) × 10−12exp[(456±65)/T]Uncertainties are 2AσlnA and 2σE/R, for A and E/R, respectively.
Observation	Fig. 1 shows an example of the obtained relative loss of alcohols versus that of the reference compounds in the presence of OH.
Experiment	The 50 wt % H2O2 solution, from Prolabo, was concentrated by bubbling helium through the solution to remove water for several days prior to use and constantly during the experiment.
Background	Under atmospheric conditions, the resulting hydroxy alkyl radicals react with oxygen.
Experiment	The output pulse from the photomultiplier was integrated for a preset period by a gated charge integrator.
Model	The rate constants of the reaction of OH with the references used in this work were taken as (8.47 ± 0.34) × 10−12 for 1-butanol,8 and (11.1 ± 0.9) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for 1,3-dioxolane.9
Experiment	The gas mixture illuminated was then renewed every two laser shots.
Experiment	The concentrations of alcohols and references were in the range 30–100 ppm.
Background	The only existing data reported in the literature are those of Hai et al. for 2-methyl-1-propanol4 Saunders et al. for 3-methyl-1-butanol5 and Wallington et al. for 3-methyl-2-butanol.6
Experiment	The helium carrier gas (UHP certified to >99.9995% (Alphagas)) was used without purification.
Method	The experimental set-up used to measure the relative rate constant consisted of a 120 L Teflon bag and lamps positioned in a wooden box with the internal faces covered with aluminium foil.
Object	Absolute rate constants have been measured for the gas-phase reactions of hydroxyl radicals with 2-methyl-1-propanol (k1), 3-methyl-1-butanol (k2) and 3-methyl-2-butanol (k3).
Conclusion	One of the possible reasons for this discrepancy is that the SAR of Atkinson considers only effects of the OH substituent on H-atom abstraction at the α- and the β- positions for hydroxyl-containing compounds while the available data shows that the oxygenated functional groups have long-range effects with respect to H-atom abstraction at sites remote from the substituent groups.3
Experiment	Experiments were conducted in the temperature range 241–373 K and a total pressure of (106 ± 5) Torr of helium.
Method	Experiments were carried out using two different techniques, the relative rate method and the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique.
Background	Several kinetic studies of the OH reaction with alcohols have been reported previously.2,3
Background	Alcohols are emitted into the atmosphere by a wide number of anthropogenic and natural processes.1
Model	To calculate k1–k3 we used also the following parameters as defined by Kwok and Atkinson: F(–CH3) = 1, F(–CH2–) = F(CH–) = F(C) = 1.23, kprim = 0.136, ksec = 0.934, ktert = 1.94 and kOH = 0.14 (k are in units of 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1) where F(–CH3), F(–CH2–), F(CH–), and F(C) are the substituent factors and kprim, ksec, ktert and kOH represent the rate constants for the H-atom abstraction from –CH3, –CH2–, CH–, and –OH, respectively.11
Background	These authors measured k1 relative to the rate constant of OH reactions with propane and cyclohexane and obtained (9.08±0.35) × 10−12 and (9.94±0.47) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively.
Experiment	The gas mixture, the photolytic precursor (H2O2), and the bath gas (helium) flowed through the cell with a linear velocity ranging from 3 to 10 cm s−1.
Background	The gas-phase atmospheric oxidation of alcohols is primary initiated by reaction with OH radicals.2,3
Background	As far as we know, this work provides the first temperature dependence studies for the three reactions.
Experiment	Alcohols were premixed with helium in a 10 L glass bulb to form 0.2–0.6% mixture at a total pressure of about 850 Torr.
Conclusion	The three alcohols were purified to better than 99.5% and hence loss of OH radicals by reaction with impurities in the gas mixtures is expected to be insignificant.
Background	This long-range effect indicates an alternative pathway to the direct concerted hydrogen abstraction process such as the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex in which, first, a hydrogen bond is formed between the H atom of the OH radical and the O atom of the oxygenated compound then a second hydrogen bond is formed between the O atom of the OH radical and a H atom in the hydrocarbon chain, resulting in intermolecular H-atom transfer via a cyclic transition state.3,14
Experiment	All flow rates were measured with mass flow meters calibrated by measuring the rate of pressure increase in a known volume.
Background	Wu et al. measured also the rate constant for the reaction of OH with 3-methyl-1-butanol using the same references, they obtained (13.8±0.5) × 10−12 and (13.7±1.1) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 with propane and cyclohexane, respectively.
Background	The α-hydroxy alkyl radicals formed through H-atom abstraction from the CHx group bonded to OH react solely with O2 to lead to carbonyls:2,20RR′CHOH + OH → RR′C˙OH + H2ORR′C˙OH + O2 → RR′C(O) + HO2The other hydroxy alkyl radicals (β, γ, etc.) react with O2 and NO to lead to different alkoxy hydroxy radicals which then react with O2 or decompose.
Experiment	The column was operated at the temperature of 318 K, and helium was used as the carrier gas.
Result	The high [alcohol]/[OH]0 ratios and low OH concentrations made negligible contribution from secondary reactions involving the products of reactions to the measured rate constants.
Background	Product distribution studies on the reaction of OH radicals with long chain linear alcohols in the presence of NOx in air have shown that H-atom abstraction from different positions (α, β, or γ) to the –OH group makes a significant contribution to the total reaction.2,11–16
Background	However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted on the absolute measurements of the OH reaction rate constant with alcohols with more than four carbon atoms.
Background	It has to be noticed that this kind of discrepancy between the experimental and calculated rate constants values for the reaction of OH with hydroxyl-containing organic compounds has already been mentioned earlier.12,13
Object	Kinetics of the reactions of the OH radical with 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol between 241 and 373 K
Background	In addition, recent mechanistic studies have suggested that isomerization of this type of intermediate oxy radicals may also be important in the oxidation of long chain alcohols, through a six-membered transition state, leading to the formation of hydroxyketones and hydroxyaldehydes.16–19
Method	The pulsed laser photolysis–laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique was used to determine the absolute rate coefficients for the above reactions in the temperature range 241–373 K at around 100 Torr while the relative method enabled us to conduct the measurements at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Background	In the gas phase, the primary degradation step of alcohols in the troposphere is reaction with OH radicals since other processes such as reactions with O3 and NO3, and photolysis are of minor importance.2,3
Observation	While the experimental values of k1 and k3 are in good agreement with the calculated ones, that of k2 is a factor of 1.6 higher than that calculated using the SAR.
Observation	Our measured value of k2 and that of Wu et al4. are in agreement with that previously reported by Saunders et al. using the discharge flow–laser induced fluorescence (DF-LIF) technique at 1 Torr total pressure and 298 K (k2 = (13.1±2.6) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1).5
Method	A gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID, CP-3800 or Star 3600 CX, Varian) was used for the quantitative analysis of the reactants.
Experiment	Chromatographic separation was achieved by using a DB-1 capillary column (J&W Scientific, 30 m, 0.25 nm id, 5 μm film).
Method	The pulsed laser photolysis–laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique and the methodology used have been described in detail previously [e.g. in ref. 7], only a brief description is given here.
Observation	In all conditions, the OH decays were found to be exponential over at least three lifetimes.
Observation	The measured values of k1–k3 shown in Table 2 are plotted in the Arrhenius form in Fig. 3.
Experiment	Typically the fluorescence signal from 10 different delay times and 100 probe laser shots were averaged to generate OH concentration-time profiles over at least three lifetimes.
Experiment	A Nd:YAG-pumped frequency-doubled dye laser was used to excite the OH radicals at λ = 282 nm.
Observation	Moreover, in absence of H2O2, the photolysis of the mixtures (alcohols and references in air) for more than one hour did not show any decrease in the concentrations.
Experiment	OH radicals were produced by photolysing H2O2 using lamps emitting at 254 nm (Sylvania G30W) and illuminating the hole gas sample.
Result	The derived lifetimes are around 10 h for the three alcohols which indicate that these compounds are quickly removed from the atmosphere and give rise to other stable products that have longer lifetimes such as acetone.
Observation	Fig. 2 shows examples of the plots of k′ versus the alcohol concentrations obtained at 298 K.
Background	This work provides the first temperature dependence parameters for the OH reaction with 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl 1-butanol and 3-methyl 2-butanol.
Background	3-methyl-1-butanol (isopentanol) is used as a chemical intermediate and solvent, and in pharmaceutical products and medicines.
Observation	The calculated k1–k3 values compared to the experimental ones (in brackets) are k1 = 0.89 (0.96) ; k2 = 0.92 (1.45) and k3 = 1.28 (1.23) (units of 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1).
Background	The measured OH reaction rate constants (k) along with a typical OH concentration of [OH] = 2 × 106 molecule cm−3,21 can be used to estimate the tropospheric lifetimes (τ = 1/k[OH]) of the studied alcohols.
Result	The kinetic data were used to derive the following Arrhenius expressions in the temperature range 241–373 K(in units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1):k1 = (3.1±0.9) × 10−12exp[(352±82)/T]k2 = (2.8±0.9) × 10−12exp[(503±98)/T]k3 = (2.6±0.6) × 10−12exp[(456±65)/T]At 298 K, the reaction rate constants obtained by the two methods were in very good agreement.
Object	The rate constants obtained in this work are compared with the previously reported data in Table 3.
Background	As a chemical intermediate, 2-methyl-1-propanol is used to make esters and ethers.
Model	The decay rate k′ is the first-order OH disappearance rate in the presence of the alcohol and k′0 is the first-order rate constant for OH removal in absence of alcohol (attributed to the diffusion of OH radicals out of the detection zone and to their reaction with H2O2).
Experiment	Typically, alcohol and H2O2 concentrations were in the ranges (1.6–92)×1013 and (1–10)×1013 molecule cm−3, respectively. k′0 and k′ were in the ranges 60–140 s−1 and 200–13000 s−1, respectively.
Experiment	The rate constant for the reaction of OH with the three alcohols were measured at (298 ± 3) K and 760 Torr, relatively to the rate constant of OH with 1-butanol and 1,3-dioxolane.
Object	The present rate constant values k1–k3 can be compared with those calculated from the structure–activity relationship (SAR) of Atkinson based on group reactivity using the revised substituent factors F(–OH) = 2.9 and F(–CH2OH) = F(CHOH) = F(COH) = 2..611,12
Experiment	H2O2 was introduced into the reaction cell by passing a small flow of helium through a glass bubbler containing H2O2 solution.
Experiment	Hydroxyl radicals were produced by photolysis of H2O2 at λ = 248 nm (KrF excimer laser) and their concentration was monitored at various reaction times ranging from about 10 μs to 10 ms by pulsed laser induced fluorescence.
Background	The main sources are due to their use as solvent in different industries.
Experiment	Kinetic experiments have been performed under pseudo-first-order conditions with the concentration of alcohols in large excess over that of OH concentration ([alcohol]0 > 100[OH]0).
Experiment	Typically, the initial OH concentration, [OH]0, was around 2×1011 molecule cm−3.
Object	In this article, we report the rate coefficient data for the reactions of OH radicals with 2-methyl-1-propanol (k1), 3-methyl-1-butanol (k2) and 3-methyl-2-butanol (k3): OH + (CH3)2CHCH2OH→products: k1OH + (CH3)2CHCH2CH2OH→products: k2OH + (CH3)2CHCH(OH)CH3→products: k3Experiments were carried out using two different techniques.
Result	At room temperature, reaction of OH radicals with alcohols proceeds mainly by an H-atom abstraction process from the C–H bonds of the CH3–, –CH2- and CH– groups with a minor contribution of the H-atom abstraction from the -OH group.2,15–20
Result	The results show a negative temperature dependence for k1, k2 and k3 similarly to other alcohols for which temperature dependence data are available such as n-propanol, i-propanol and n-butanol.8
Observation	As expected, variation in the photolysis fluence (3–26 mJ cm−2) had no effect on the determined rate constants.
Background	For example, 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol) is commonly used in coatings, as an additive in gasoline, an intermediate for glycol ethers and agricultural chemicals, and in anti-corrosion and anti-wear additives in engine oils.
Result	The room temperature rate constant taken as the average of all values obtained at (298 ± 2) K are:k1 = (1.0 ± 0.1)×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.k2 = (1.5 ± 0.1)×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.k3 = (1.2 ± 0.1)×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.The quoted errors for k1–k3 include 2σ from the least-squares analysis and the systematic error (5%, due to uncertainties in measured concentrations).
Experiment	Measured amounts of reagents were flushed from calibrated bulbs into the Teflon bag through a stream of ultra pure air.
Result	The measured k2 value supports the statement of Bethel et al. indicating that accurate estimation of OH radical rate constants for all hydroxyl-containing compounds (to within better than a factor of two) does not appear possible using the general approach of the SAR developed by Atkinson.12
Goal	The results are presented, discussed and used to estimate the atmospheric lifetimes for the studied alcohols.
Observation	The compounds showed a good stability when they were mixed in the chamber with H2O2 and kept in the dark for about 1 h.
Experiment	Fluorescence from the OH radicals was detected by a photomultiplier, fitted with a 309 nm narrow bandpass filter.
Goal	The present work also aims at extending the kinetic data base to be used to develop structure-reactivity relationships for OH reaction with oxygenated VOCs.
Observation	For isobutanol, the measured value of k1 at room temperature is in good agreement with that obtained by Wu et al. using the relative rate method.4

Background	Significant pieces of information required to carry out the propagation in eqns. (7) and (8) have been developed recently.
Method	The photofragments separate spatially from this direction according to their transverse momentum and they are detected in coincidence using position- and time-sensitive multihit-detectors3 after a free-flight of 1510 mm.
Conclusion	The highly structured maps of correlation in the motion of the three atoms provide a direct view of the internal molecular couplings which initiate dissociation.
Background	Among these are studies of some of the nonadiabatic14,15 and Jahn–Teller induced couplings16 as well as time-dependent dynamics simulations.13–15,17
Background	A unique map of three correlated momentum vectors can be represented in a Dalitz11 plot.
Result	This difference implies that for each electronic state different areas of phase space play the leading role in step (7) and hence dictate a specific form of .
Background	The projection of the wavepacket in eqn. (7) depends sensitively on the overlap of the initial H3* state with the continuum and restrictions imposed on the projection by symmetry considerations.
Result	The initial electronic states have nearly identical nuclear geometry because the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the excited states are all close to the geometry of the parent ion core H3+.12
Model	This situation is indicated in Fig. 1, which gives a cut through the potential energy surfaces of H3 along the symmetric stretch coordinate.
Background	This state is present in the neutral beam of H3 molecules in a range of vibrational levels {v1,v2}, where v1 and v2 describe the symmetric stretch and degenerate bending mode vibrational quantum numbers.
Background	A basis of quantum chemistry is the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, according to which nuclei move on single adiabatic potential energy surfaces created by the much faster moving electrons.
Method	In the photodissociation experiment described here the molecules are photoexcited inside the cavity of a narrowband dye laser which is tuned to a specific absorption transition to a molecular Rydberg state below the ionization threshold.
Result	However the electronic, rovibrational, and nuclear symmetries of the excited states differ and thereby control the coupling matrix elements for predissociation into the ground state continuum.
Model	Neglecting spin- and orbital angular momenta it may be written as the product wavefunction of the three hydrogen atoms ψc = Φ1(k⃑1)Φ2(k⃑2)Φ3(k⃑3).Since the molecular state under study is selected in the laser-excitation step the energy condition holds (m being the hydrogen mass), in addition to momentum conservation k⃑1 + k⃑2 + k⃑3 = 0.
Model	The exit channel in reaction (1) is well defined in terms of three plane waves with center-of-mass momenta k⃑i.
Background	Photoexcitation spectra of H3 and D3 have been studied in detail6 and firm electronic, vibrational, and rotational assignments of the spectra have emerged, backed by MQDT theory based solely on ab-initio parameters.7
Background	At present, no rigorous theory has treated a molecular three-body problem such as (1), however a formal discussion can be given.
Model	This probability-density plot gives the vector correlation in terms of the reduced energies of the three atoms where εi = |k⃑i|2/(2mW).
Background	A simple model based on a geometry- and state-independent coupling operator  fails to explain the finer details in the measured correlation maps.18
Result	The tightly bound ion is of D3h geometry with a proton separation of 1.64 a0 at the potential minimum.
Result	In this work we determined the correlation map for about twenty electronic and vibrational molecular states of H3 and D3 in the energy range between 0.85 and 3.60 eV above the three-particle asymptote H(1s) + H(1s) + H(1s).
Background	The rotationless 2p 2A2″ state of H3 is immune against rapid predissociation.5
Model	The initially bound H3* molecule is prepared at time t0.
Method	High speed time-to-digital converters permit to measure the spatial coordinates of the impact positions of the neutral atoms with a resolution of <100 µm and the arrival time differences between the three atoms with a resolution of <100 ps.
Result	The attached Rydberg electron adds small modifications to the binding, leading to small (<5%) variations in the proton separation at equilibrium.
Result	The complexity of such a task is apparent from Fig. 4 which gives two selected cuts through the potential energy surfaces of H3.
Model	Pronounced islands of high probability appear, their location depending on the type of electronic excitation, on the vibrational state, and on nuclear mass.
Model	At low vibrational excitation its heavy particle wavefunction ψR(t0) is restricted by locally quadratic potentials.
Result	This feature dictates the appearance of the Dalitz plots as we will discuss below.
Model	In the limit of t → ∞ the function ψc(t) approaches eqn. (3).
Method	We prepare metastable triatomic hydrogen molecules in a fast (3 keV) beam by charge transfer neutralization of H3+.
Goal	Since final and initial states are precisely defined from our experiment, the challenge is to perform a quantum calculation with proper account of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.
Method	Following photoexcitation the molecules typically predissociate on time scales of 1–10 ns,8 their center of mass propagating at an energy of 3 keV.
Background	Many interesting aspects of molecular dynamics such as molecule formation and dissociation arise from the breakdown of this approximation.
Background	This phase is followed by the evolution of the wavepacket on the continuum energy surface13 where  is the Hamiltonian describing the motion of the three atoms.
Conclusion	Certainly the experiment has reached a level of sophistication which warrants an in-depth confrontation with this fundamental system of three protons and three electrons.
Result	Fig. 2 illustrates the meaning of the position of an event in the Dalitz plot in terms of the orientation and magnitude of the fragment momenta.
Result	After recording the dissociation of ≈104 molecules, we obtain a map of preferred momentum correlation, under which the selected H3* state escapes into the three-particle continuum.
Background	On the basis of symmetry arguments we know that s A′1 states are predissociated by the degenerate bending mode, d E″ states by rotational coupling,19 and p E′ states by Jahn–Teller coupling.16
Object	Nonadiabatic coupling and vector correlation in dissociation of triatomic hydrogen
Method	These data are coded into a Dalitz plot (see below) after accounting for the geometric detection efficiency.4
Method	Over this flight distance the fragments separate in space by as much as 100 mm.
Result	The sum of the kinetic energies of the three H-atoms is fixed by selecting the energy of the H3* molecule by laser excitation in the range between 0.85 and 3.60 eV.
Model	In a first phase the bound molecular state accesses the repulsive ground state surface of H3ψm(t1) = ψRi,j(t0)where ψm(t1) is a continuum wavepacket at molecular distances and the operator  describes the modification of the normal mode wave functions due to the coupling.
Object	We discuss this feature in a model calculation and in terms of a new quantum chemical calculations of the potential energy surfaces of H3*.
Background	This is due to small terms in the molecular Hamiltonian which originate from the finite response time of electron motion to changing nuclear position.
Result	Thus islands of preferrred population in a Dalitz plot refer to specific orientations of final-state fragment momenta.
Method	In this way the total energy of the molecule, W, defined relative to three separated hydrogen atoms, H(1s) + H(1s) + H(1s), is precisely fixed in the experiment.
Background	This approximation permits the definition of isolated electronic molecular states and their energy levels.
Conclusion	As H3 is the primary example of a polyatomic system an ab initio treatment of the nonadiabatic couplings in this system will significantly extend our microscopic understanding of molecular dynamics.
Background	A direct access to the dependence of these couplings on molecular coordinates has eluded experimental observation to date, except for diatomics.1
Conclusion	We therefore conclude that our experiment provides a direct image of the action of the operator , which couples excited molecular states with the final state continuum.
Method	A triple-coincidence logic-routine10 examines the positions and arrival-times to distinguish process (1) from the fragmentation channel H3* → H2(1Σ+g) + H(1s).For each triple coincidence event, the momentum vectors {k⃑1,k⃑2,k⃑3} in the center-of-mass frame are evaluated from the time and position information.
Result	Typical examples are shown in Fig. 3.
Object	In our experiment we monitor the reaction H3* → H(1s) + H(1s) + H(1s).for individual, state-selected H3* molecules and determine separately for each molecule the three atomic momentum vectors in coincidence using technologies described previously.2–4
Conclusion	The dependence of  on electronic and nuclear coordinates and symmetries is embedded in an inverse problem of relating probability density in the Dalitz plot to phase-space density of the molecular level.
Result	We determine experimentally the vector correlation among the three neutral ground state hydrogen atoms which appear in dissociation of neutral H3* molecules.
Model	It is characterized by products of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions χ in the symmetric stretch and bending normal mode coordinates, Qs and Qb, with {i,j} quanta of vibrational excitation ψRi,j(t0) = χi(Qs)χj(Qb).In a time-dependent approach we may formally view process (1) as a sequence of two steps.

Background	Additionally, X-ray absorption, EPR and electronic spectroscopic studies on the Mn2III and MnIIIMnIV states have garnered a great deal of knowledge that aids the biomimetic studies of this enzyme to a great extent.24,26–28
Object	In addition to calculations on the mixed-valence MnIIIMnIV complex, various electronic configurations of the corresponding MnIIIMnIII and MnIVMnIV complexes are explored.
Result	Consistent trends are also seen when we compare the present results with those of our study on MnIII(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)MnIV and MnIII(μ-O)(μ-O2CH)2MnIV complexes:31 in each case, the BS (S = 1/2) complex can be described as a largely valence-trapped structure consisting of high-spin MnIII antiferromagnetically coupled to MnIV, although the MnIII(μ-O)(μ-O2CH)2MnIV core is rather more electronically complex and displays configurational mixing from low-spin MnIII.
Conclusion	There are also indications that the strength of the crossed exchange pathway depends upon the energy spacing between the atomic orbitals involved in this pathway.
Result	The S = 4 configuration explored corresponds to a ferromagnetically coupled, high-spin MnIII dimer, while the S = 2 configuration consists of two low-spin MnIII centers which are ferromagnetically coupled.
Conclusion	This is broadly consistent with previous studies, both experimental8,13 and theoretical,31–34,48–50 which generally find MnIIIMnIV complexes featuring oxo bridges to adopt antiferromagnetically coupled configurations with some degree of valence trapping.
Method	Several previous theoretical studies on oxygen-bridged MnIIIMnIV complexes, with a variety of bridging motifs, have been reported.
Result	The remaining occupied valence metal-based orbital, 40a1 (↑), shows a modest degree (14%) of MnB character but is principally identifiable as MnA with mixing from the immediately attached oxygens of the carboxylate ligands.
Result	Further structural analysis—for example, of the variation in Mn–O–Mn angles as a function of the bridging combination within different modelled complexes—can be given: not surprisingly, the Mn–O–Mn angles found here, of 87.4° (BS) and 91.7° (S = 7/2), are uniformly less than those which we have previously reported for the complexes containing MnIII(μ-O)2MnIV (97.7° (BS)), MnIII(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)MnIV (94.2° (BS); 93.4° (S = 7/2)), and MnIII(μ-O)(μ-O2CH)2MnIV (130.5° (BS); 124.7° (S = 7/2)) cores , reflecting the more compact Mn–Mn distance in the present case.
Result	Composition of the occupied 39a1, 10a2, and 17b2 orbitals, as detailed in Table 3, clearly shows that the magnetic exchange between metal atoms is dominated by superexchange via the oxo bridges, in keeping with the results of our earlier investigations of di-30 and tri-μ-oxo-49 and mixed oxo- and carboxylato-bridged31 MnIIIMnIV dinuclear complexes.
Method	We reported the first example of such a case in the complex, [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CArTol)2(bpy)2]+ (where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, and ArTolCO2− = 2,6-di(p–tolyl)benzoate) (2), which incorporates a sterically hindering carboxylate ligand.29
Result	The MnIII and MnIV centers are found to be strongly antiferromagnetically coupled in all other dinuclear complexes.13,35–40
Method	For the d3d3 (MnIVMnIV) dinuclear complex, we have explored only the MS = 0 (BS) and S = 3 configurations which correspond, respectively, to antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling of two MnIV centers.
Background	Catalase promotes the disproportionation of toxic H2O2 in aerobic organisms to H2O and O2.24
Model	Density functional theory calculations were performed on Linux-based Pentium IV computers using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program, version ADF 2002.03,41 developed by Baerends et al.42,43
Method	In the work reported here, density functional theory calculations were used to address this issue.
Object	Here, we report detailed density functional theory calculations performed on this newly formed dimanganese core in order to determine the electronic and steric effects of the sterically encumbering carboxylate ligands.
Background	However, a dinuclear complex where the metal centers are bridged simultaneously by a pair of oxo groups and a pair of carboxylato groups was unknown in transition metal chemistry until recently.
Conclusion	It is tempting to alternatively interpret the mixture of α-spin MnA and MnB content in the 40a1 orbital, with MnA dominant, as an indication of the balance between the ‘high-spin MnIII’ d4d3 (MnIIIMnIV) description of this state, in which the excess α-spin electron is localized on α-spin-dominant MnA, and the ‘low-spin MnIII’ d3d4 (MnIVMnIII) configuration with the excess α-spin electron localized on otherwise β-spin-dominant MnB.
Result	Nevertheless, for all of the mixed μ-oxo/μ-carboxylato bridged complexes which we have studied,31 the disparity between MnIII–O and MnIV–O is more extreme in the ferromagnetically coupled S = 7/2 configuration than for S = 1/2.
Result	It is also worthwhile to compare the geometries of the homonuclear MnIIIMnIII and MnIVMnIV complexes with that of the broken-symmetry MnIIIMnIV minimum; the central bond lengths and bond angles for all of these structures are included in Table 1.
Result	The Mn2O2 core geometry may well not hold a significant direct influence over the crossed-exchange pathway, since this appears to operate through mixing of near-degenerate orbitals rather than through overlap, but the antiferromagnetic pathways Jxy/xy and Jyz/yz (which are, respectively, analogous to the Jxz/xz and Jyz/yz pathways explored in our study of the di-μ-oxo-bridged complexes)30 are dependent on the overlap of Mn-centered and O-centered orbitals and thus should be affected by the Mn–Mn and Mn–O distances and the Mn–O–Mn angles.
Result	Instead, the 39a1 (↑), 17b2 (↑), and 10a2 (↑) MOs show strong mixing between MnA and the oxo bridges, with the corresponding spin-down MOs similarly mixed between MnB and the oxo bridges.
Background	Most of these aforementioned multinuclear manganoenzymes harbor carboxylate-bridged Mn centers along with histidine N-donor ligands.
Model	For calculations on antiferromagnetically coupled structures, the broken symmetry (BS) approach of Noodleman47 was affected using the ModifyStartPotential key to introduce an initial spin inhomogeneity between the two metal atoms.
Background	The dimanganese center in this enzyme exists in four oxidation states: reduced MnII2, mixed-valent MnIIMnIII, oxidized MnIII2, and super-oxidized MnIIIMnIV forms.
Result	Note, however, that all of the ferromagnetically-coupled structures detailed in Table 1 have metal–metal separations which significantly exceed those of the antiferromagnetically-coupled (broken-symmetry) minima, and of the crystallographically-isolated complex.
Conclusion	It is tempting to suggest that the strength of this crossed-exchange pathway is acutely sensitive to the proximity of the singly occupied and unoccupied a1-symmetry orbitals involved in this mixing, but further study is required to substantiate this notion.
Result	The total energy for this configuration is only 14 kJ mol−1 above that of the S = 1/2 C2v (BS) optimized geometry.
Result	There is very good agreement between the calculated MnIIIMnIV geometry and the optimized MnIVMnIV structures, insofar as the coordination around the MnIV center (MnB) of the mixed-valence complex is concerned.
Background	In contrast, in the previously reported two structures, three Mn atoms were roughly placed at three corners of an isosceles triangle and the fourth Mn was found to be at the center of the triangle obtruding towards the lumenal surface of the membrane.14,15
Method	Specifically, it was thought that intramolecular nonbonded contacts could play an important role.
Method	Complex 2 has been structurally characterized with X-ray crystallography.
Conclusion	This valence-trapped distortion of the metal/bridge core, in turn, appears to be heavily influenced by the crossed-exchange pathway, which leads to a lessening of the Jahn–Teller distortion experienced by the nominal MnIII centre.
Conclusion	Analysis of the optimized structures from those studies and from our earlier examples of μ-oxo-bridged MnIIIMnIV complexes,30,31 leads to the conclusion that the (μ-O)2(μ-O2CR)2 bridging combination leads innately to a Mn–Mn distance which is markedly smaller than that found for any of the bridging motifs yet explored except for that of MnIV(μ-O)3MnIV,49 for which our calculated metal–metal separation of 2.320 Å is only 0.1 Å shorter than the corresponding distance in the MnIVMnIV structure explored in the present work.
Conclusion	This tendency for ‘milder’ Mn-ligand bond lengths in the broken-symmetry configuration than in S = 7/2 presumably indicates that the valence trapping within the BS state is less extreme than in S = 7/2, implying that pathways for overlap or mixing of Mn-based orbitals exist for S = 1/2 which are not viable (or which are less effective) for S = 7/2.
Result	The carboxylic oxygens lie on the nominal Jahn–Teller axis in this instance, and the shorter MnIII-Ocarb distance of 2.27 Å seen for the S = 1/2 MnIIIMnIV dimer than that found for the S = 7/2 structure (2.32 Å) is consistent with the structural implications of the crossed-exchange mechanism.
Result	If we assess the ratio of ‘MnIV’ to ‘MnIII’ character in the highest-occupied a1-symmetry orbital of di-μ-oxo-bridged complexes featuring, respectively, 0,30 2 (this work), and 131 carboxylato bridge(s), we find that this ratio consistently increases from 0.25 to 0.3 to 0.55 as the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied α-spin a1-symmetry orbitals is reduced from 1.35 to 1.29 to 0.85 eV.
Result	Density functional theory calculations on the model compound [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2]+ reproduce the crystallographic structure very satisfactorily.
Method	The [Mn2(μ-O)2(bpy)2] moiety in 2 is approximately planar, as shown in Fig. 1, while two carboxylate ligands bridge between Mn centers, one from above and one from below this plane.
Background	Based on the findings from these studies and manganese oxide mineral structures, several possible arrangements comprising oxo-bridged dinuclear and trinuclear structural motifs have been put forward for the different S states of the PSII Mn4 cluster.9,22
Result	This resemblance is reflected both structurally, in the elongation of bonds from the MnIII atom to the μ-oxo bridges, and the more pronounced elongation of bonds from MnIII to the axially-coordinated atoms (respectively, the N of NH3, or the O of the carboxylate bridge), and in the electronic configuration determined for the S = 1/2 broken symmetry state.
Method	Complex 2 was obtained by ligand substitution on 1.
Conclusion	The energetic proximity of the delocalized configuration is attributed to an effective crossed-exchange mechanism, which permits mixing of an eg-based orbital (nominally on high-spin MnIII) with a vacant t2g-based orbital (nominally on MnIV).
Method	X-ray crystallographic analysis performed on this complex reveals a trapped mix-valence species as evidenced, for example, by very different metal–ligand bond distances at the MnIII and MnIV centers.
Background	Locations of the essential cofactors, calcium and chloride ions, have not been resolved beyond doubt in these latter structures.
Result	In contrast, calculations on the S = 7/2 state in D2h symmetry led to a structure with enforced delocalization of all of the Mn-based electrons.
Background	The Mn⋯Mn separations were found to be 3.13 Å in the reduced form,23 and 3.03 Å in the oxidized form,25 as deduced from X-ray crystallography.
Background	Many synthetic efforts aimed at obtaining suitable structural replicas for these enzyme active sites, especially catalase and the PSII WO, resulted in the isolation of a number of di-, tri-, and tetranuclear complexes supported largely by pyridine-based N-donor and commercially available carboxylate ligands.
Result	In particular, the BS calculation demonstrates that the asymmetry in bond lengths between Mn atoms and the carboxylate O atoms arises through electronic effects rather than through steric considerations, since the bulky carboxylate substituent of the crystallographically isolated species is replaced with H in our model compound.
Conclusion	This analysis of the MO composition from the S = 1/2 structure suggests that the direct Mn–Mn bonding contribution to the bond length is minor compared to the constraints of the oxo and carboxylato bridges.
Background	Among them, dimanganese complexes containing [Mn2(μ-O)2], [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-carboxylato)] and [Mn2(μ-O)(μ-carboxylato)2] cores are common, [Mn2(μ-O)2(bpy)4](ClO4)3 (1) being the first member in this family.13
Result	The mixed μ-oxo/μ-carboxylato bridged complexes also invariably display markedly longer bonds for MnIII–O than for MnIV–O (whether to oxo or carboxylato O atoms), but the elongation of the MnIII–O (carboxylato) bonds within the present S = 1/2 complex (bond lengths of 2.27 Å are 0.3 Å longer than the corresponding MnIV–O distances) is rather greater than is seen in the earlier study,31 presumably because in the present work these carboxylato O atoms lie on the Jahn–Teller axis.
Result	Better general agreement with the geometry surrounding MnA is seen for the ferromagnetically coupled, high-spin (S = 4) MnIIIMnIII structure also summarized in Table 1.
Result	In fact, the di-μ-oxo-bridged species [(NH3)4MnIII(μ-O)2MnIV(NH3)4]3+, which we have previously studied,30 is seen to bear a very close resemblance to the species under investigation in the present work.
Conclusion	While a more detailed analysis of this trend appears unwarranted since the species being compared do not possess identical terminal ligands in all cases, the results of our present study certainly strengthen the grounds for hypothesizing that the crossed exchange pathway is most efficient when the respective majority-spin eg-derived MnIII and minority-spin t2g-derived MnIV orbitals are most nearly degenerate.
Method	Other dinuclear Mn(iii, iv) complexes exhibit valence trapping in the solid state, however the Mn-axial ligand bond distances are not so dramatically different.
Background	Furthermore, since one of the glutamate residues (glu 178) is close to the dimanganese site in the Lactobacillus plantarum structure, there exists the possibility that, in another super-oxidized form, it joins glu 66 in spanning the dimanganese core.5
Result	Note that, due to differences in the axis assignments of the two studies (see Fig. 2 for the axis assignment used here), the occupied majority-spin eg-derived orbital on MnIII is identified, in the earlier study, as dz2 and the vacant minority-spin t2g-derived orbital on MnIV is dx2−y2.
Result	Our calculations show that there is a considerable energetic preference for low-spin MnIII, which contrasts with the results of our previous calculations on di-μ-oxo-bridged (and mixed oxo-/carboxylato-bridged) MnIII dimers for which high-spin MnIII is preferred.30,31
Result	However, the agreement between geometric parameters featuring MnA (the identified MnIII center of the mixed-valence complex) and the MnIII centers in the broken-symmetry MnIIIMnIII geometry is much poorer.
Object	These calculations allow direct comparison with the results of DFT studies on Mn2 complexes with bridging motifs such as (μ-O)3, (μ-O)2(μ-O2), and (μ-O)(μ-O2) which have been investigated in the MnIIIMnIII and /or MnIVMnIV oxidation states, but not in the MnIIIMnIV configuration.48–50
Model	Mixed high-spin/low-spin dimers are represented in the S = 1 and S = 3 configurations which are, respectively, antiferromagnetically and ferromagnetically coupled, while the MS = 0 (broken symmetry, BS) configuration is an antiferromagnetic coupling of equivalent MnIII centers.
Method	The fact that there are rather bulky bridging carboxylate ligands present in this recently reported dinuclear species raises the question as to whether they affect the extent of valence trapping and the metrical parameters in general.
Result	While the latter species does not describe a tenable solution to the MnIIIMnIV complex’s electronic configuration, its relative energy (only 19 kJ mol−1 above that of the S = 1/2 C2v (BS) optimized geometry) emphasizes that the energetic preference for the C2v geometry, with distinctly different coordination environments around the two metal atoms, is really rather slight.
Model	Within the broken symmetry framework, each MnIII center in the BS configuration can be either high-spin or low-spin.
Conclusion	Our density functional theory calculations on the complex [(bpy)Mn(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2Mn(bpy)] show excellent structural agreement with the crystallographic results which have previously been reported for a closely analogous complex featuring bulky carboxylate substituents.29
Method	The fourth bridging group between Mn centers is likely responsible for the resulting unusual distance and angles.
Background	However, in the absence of sufficient crystallographic information the Mn4 species has been conjectured in all of its kinetically accessible oxidation states (S0 to S3) with the aid of spectroscopic modes, most commonly X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques.9,17–21
Conclusion	Accordingly, we can confidently assign the experimentally observed asymmetric structure, with markedly canted carboxylate bridges, as arising from an innate electronic preference of the Mn(μ-O)2(μ-O2CR)2Mn core for a valence-trapped MnIIIMnIV configuration (with MnIII identifiably dominated by high-spin character, although an idealized low-spin structure is only 14 kJ mol−1 higher in energy according to our calculations) and not from steric effects originating from the bulky substituents.
Conclusion	The composition of this highest occupied orbital is particularly pertinent.
Model	Electrons in orbitals up to and including 1s {C, N, O} and 2p {Mn} were treated in accordance with the frozen-core approximation.
Conclusion	This tendency is fully consistent with comparisons between the crystalline geometry of 2 and of related Mn2(μ-O)2 and Mn2(μ-O)i(μ-O2CR)j (i + j = 3) complexes, as noted above.
Result	These optimizations commenced in Cs symmetry but spontaneously converged towards the C2v optimized geometries for both the S = 1/2 and S = 7/2 states.
Method	The di-oxo di-carboxylato core discussed herein could conceivably be present as a segment of the PSII active site.
Background	In contrast, the structures of non-heme manganese-containing catalases have been determined at high resolution.5,23
Object	The S = 7/2 C2v structure is necessarily high-spin on MnIII; we have investigated also a S = 5/2 C2v configuration, which corresponds to ferromagnetically-coupled MnIV with low-spin MnIII.
Background	Manganese-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, C. ammoniagenes RRase1,2 and superoxide dismutase3 were shown to contain a single Mn ion at the reaction center, whereas dimanganese active sites are found in bacterial catalase,4,5 rat liver arginase, aminopeptidase P and in dinitrogen reductase-activating glycohydrolase.6
Model	Slater orbital basis sets used in all calculations were of triple-ξ quality (TZP).
Conclusion	In particular, it is apparent that removal of either one μ-oxo, or of one μ-carboxylato, bridge from the Mn(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2Mn core leads to a considerable lengthening of the metal–metal axis regardless of the oxidation states on the two Mn atoms.
Method	Results from studies by other groups,32,33 on di-μ-oxo-bridged MnIIIMnIV complexes, have yielded broadly similar structural results to our own,30 while a study by Noodleman and co-workers34 on a complex featuring a Mn2(μ-O)2(O2CH) core with an additional bridging RHNCH2CH2NHR ligand, possessed a Mn–Mn distance ranging from 2.55 to 2.62 Å depending on the level of theory employed.
Background	If this were the case, the native core would resemble that of 2.
Method	For purposes of structural comparison, we have previously reported Becke–Perdew (BP) calculations on such complexes featuring the cores Mn2(μ-O)2,30 Mn2(μ-O)2(O2CH), and Mn2(μ-O)(O2CH)2,31 for which Mn–Mn distances of 2.783, 2.667, and 3.269 Å were obtained.
Goal	Furthermore, what can be established for the lowest-energy electronic configuration for the MnIIIMnIV species, namely the BS (S = 1/2) C2v geometry?
Background	Metalloenzymes containing manganese at their active sites are plentiful.
Result	Using a notation scheme similar to that employed in Table 3, our earlier study reported percentage compositions of the 17a1 orbital of 31% Naxial (attached to MnA), 48% MnA (principally dz2 character), 2% Obr, 12% MnB (principally dx2−y2 character), and 0% Naxial (attached to MnB).
Result	Structural parameters obtained from calculations on a model compound bearing sterically small bridging carboxylates, [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2]+, are in good agreement with the experimentally determined single crystal X-ray structure.
Method	The first example of a dinuclear manganese complex containing two oxo and two carboxylate bridges, [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CArTol)2(bpy)2]+ (where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, and ArTolCO2− = 2,6-di(p–tolyl)benzoate), was reported recently (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 13010).
Background	The super-oxidized form has yet to be characterized crystallographically; however, EXAFS data suggests a 2.70 Å distance between the manganese centers.26
Result	Another consequence of the ‘crossed exchange’ interaction is that mixing of the occupied MnIII eg-derived orbital with a t2g-derived MnIV orbital leads to a lessening in the Jahn–Teller distortion of the MnIII center.
Result	The latter calculation spontaneously converges to a structure of D2h symmetry, indicating that in this mode of coupling a delocalized configuration is preferred.
Result	As well as (understandably) failing to reproduce the observed intermetallic asymmetry, the S = 7/2 D2h calculations yielded a total energy markedly higher than either the S = 1/2 or S = 7/2 C2v optimized geometries (see Table 2), thereby underlining the energetic preference for a ‘valence-trapped’ d3d4 (MnIVMnIII) configuration rather than a ‘delocalized’ d3.5d3.5 configuration.
Background	Some of the synthetic complexes are closely relevant to the dinuclear manganese enzymes, yet none have been shown to replicate the spectroscopic features of the PSII tetramanganese cluster.
Background	In the catalytic process the Mn4 cluster cycles through five intermediate states, known as Si (i = 0–4) states, oxygen being evolved during the S3 to S0 state conversion via the transient S4 state.
Method	Complex 2 has a Mn⋯Mn distance of 2.505(1) Å and Mn–O–Mn angles averaging 88.3°, the shortest distance and smallest angles reported for any dimanganese species containing the [Mn2(μ-O)2] core to date.
Object	In addition to calculations on the mixed-valence MnIIIMnIV complex, we have also explored various electronic configurations of the corresponding MnIIIMnIII and MnIVMnIV complexes.
Result	Our geometry optimization on the S = 1/2 ‘broken symmetry’ (BS) state of the model compound, in C2v symmetry, yields a structure for which all of the key bond lengths and bond angles, summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2, agree with the crystallographic data to within ±2.5%.
Result	For the d4d4 (MnIIIMnIII) dinuclear complex, valid single-determinant descriptions are possible for BS (MS = 0) and for S = 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Conclusion	The ‘crossed exchange’ pathway discussed above fulfils this description, since the mixing of an occupied eg-derived high-spin-MnIII-based orbital with a vacant t2g-derived MnIV-based orbital is possible only if the spins on MnIII and MnIV are (antiferromagnetically) opposed.
Method	The MnIII and MnIV centers are found to be valence-trapped in 2 in the solid state.
Background	However, the assignments greatly differ in the most recent 3.5 Å structures,16 where a Mn3Ca cubane core, linked to a mono-oxo-bridged Mn center has been proposed for the WO catalyst.
Result	Again, the antiferromagnetic broken-symmetry solution is the preferred (lower-energy) description of this dinuclear complex.
Conclusion	We conclude that the BS minimum for the MnIIIMnIV complex is best described as an antiferromagnetic coupling between high-spin MnIII and MnIV, with a modest degree of delocalization between metal atoms being evident in only one occupied valence molecular orbital.
Result	A detailed perusal of the composition of the metal-based molecular orbitals (MOs) in the BS geometry of the MnIIIMnIV complex (see Tables 3–5) reveals that none of the magnetic electrons is strongly delocalized between both metal centers.
Goal	How can we rationalize the contraction in the Mn–Mn separation when the coupling mode is switched from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic?
Conclusion	In the study on [(NH3)4MnIII(μ-O)2MnIV(NH3)4]3+ in the BS (S = 1/2) state, we found that the composition of the metal-dominated, occupied valence molecular orbitals showed strong mixing between one or other Mn atom and the oxo bridges in all but the highest occupied, α-spin, a1-symmetry metal-based orbital.
Model	Optimized geometries were obtained using the gradient algorithm of Versluis and Ziegler.46
Method	The Mn–Ocarboxylate bond lengths for the MnIII center are markedly longer than those of the MnIV center, av 2.317 Å vs. av 1.943 Å, respectively, as they are along the Jahn–Teller axis of elongation for the MnIII center.
Result	Total bond energies and relative energies, for the various electronic configurations of [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2]n+ (n = 0, 1, 2) are given in Table 2.
Background	In addition, these aforementioned studies do not address the questions regarding the structural properties of the Mn4 cluster at the higher S states.
Model	Calculations on [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2] structures, in various charge states, were performed in C2v symmetry (or, in some cases as identified, in higher symmetry) using the Becke–Perdew (BP) gradient-corrected density functional approach.44,45
Model	All calculations were performed in a spin-unrestricted fashion.
Background	An oxo-bridged tetramanganese cluster (Mn4), present at the active site of Photosystem II (PSII) Water Oxidase (WO), catalyzes the light induced water-to-oxygen conversion, the process that is responsible for existence of aerobic life on the earth.7–13
Result	There is calculated to be minimal Mn⋯Mn bonding despite contraction of the Mn⋯Mn distance relative to related complexes.
Result	The intermetallic interaction here is an example of ‘crossed exchange’ involving the Jx2−y2/z2 pathway, resulting in transfer of charge from a majority-spin, eg-derived orbital on MnIII (here dx2−y2) to a minority-spin, t2g-derived orbital on MnIV (here dz2).
Object	In addition to these C2v symmetry optimizations, calculations were also pursued on moderately distorted geometries in Cs symmetry (with the mirror plane coincident with the carboxylate ligands and Mn atoms).
Result	The extent of configurational mixing evident between high-spin MnIII (contaminated by MnIV character) and MnIV (contaminated, in turn, by low-spin MnIII character) is greater than that seen in our previous calculations on complexes containing the Mn(μ-O)2Mn core, but less than in complexes featuring a Mn(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)Mn centre.
Result	The important structural features of the BS geometry are also evident in the geometry optimized for the S = 7/2 state in C2v symmetry, although the Mn–Mn bond length found in this ferromagnetically coupled structure is over 0.1 Å longer than the experimental value.
Background	Structural information regarding the Mn4 cluster is unclear and contentious at this point, mainly due to the lack of high resolution X-ray crystal data.
Conclusion	A more detailed analysis of the structural/magnetic interplay in the Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CR)2 core is in preparation but is beyond the scope of the present work.
Object	We report the outcome of calculations on the [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2]+ core to predict the nature of the intramolecular exchange interaction between the manganese centers.
Object	Theoretical analysis of the [Mn2(μ-oxo)2(μ-carboxylato)2]+ core
Result	Although our calculations support assignment of [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2(bpy)2]+ as a valence-trapped MnIIIMnIV configuration involving high-spin MnIII, a delocalized configuration arising from low-spin MnIII is calculated to lie very close in energy.
Background	Electron density for metal ions, assigned as four Mn atoms, has been located recently in the crystal structures of the dark-adapted S1 state of Thermosynechococcus elongates and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus at resolutions of 3.5–3.8 Å.14–16
Conclusion	Thus, the sterically large carboxylate bridges in [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CArTol)2(bpy)2]+ appear not to have a significant effect on the metal–ligand bond distances and angles.
Result	As with the HOMO 40a1 in the S = 1/2 (BS) [Mn2(μ-O)2(μ-O2CH)2bpy2]+ complex which forms the focus of the present study, the 17a1 HOMO in the di-μ-oxo-bridged complex studied previously30 is therefore a crossed exchange pathway.
Object	We have also explored a D2h configuration for an unnaturally symmetric S = 1/2 species with a delocalized α-spin electron combined with α-spin versus β-spin dominance of the two metal centers.

Conclusion	Our findings suggest an important role for vibrational microscopy in studying the kinetics and mechanisms of reactions in organic single crystals.
Result	Similar results were obtained for single crystals of β-2-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid and β-4-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid.
Result	It may be seen from Fig. 2 that the conversion of β-2,4-dichloro-trans-cinnamic acid to the corresponding β-truxinic acid derivative follows strictly first order kinetics over the conversion range 0–97%.
Background	Interest in reactions of organic single crystals has recently been rekindled because of the possibility of “crystal engineering” in which the crystal lattice is utilized to direct the course of the reaction and to determine the stereochemistry of products.1,2
Result	As Fig. 3 shows, the photodimerisation of β-2-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid and β-4-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid deviate somewhat from first order kinetics.
Result	(The linear relationship is maintained at even higher conversions, but the scatter in the data becomes greater when the monomer concentration is very low and small measurement errors in this concentration lead to large errors in its logarithm.) Repeat experiments were carried out on crystals of slightly different sizes (range around 30–100 µm) and it was found that the order of reaction was unaffected by crystal size although the reaction proceeded more slowly for larger crystals.
Conclusion	In all three cases the reactions proceed smoothly from monomer to dimer with no hint of any reaction intermediate.
Conclusion	By contrast the corresponding reactions in single crystals of β-2-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid and β-4-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid deviate somewhat from first order kinetics as a result of solid-state effects.
Experiment	A single crystal (length around 30 µm) of the reagent under investigation7 was placed on a BaF2 window on the stage of a Nicolet Nic-Plan microscope attached to a Nicolet model 730 spectrometer located at beamline 13.3 of the Daresbury Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source.
Background	In part this deficiency results from the lack of suitable methods to provide the necessary information.
Hypothesis	In the absence of an exciton mechanism, one would thus expect the photon flux to be rate-determining and the reaction would be zero order.
Result	Our findings demonstrate that the reaction also certainly proceeds via an exciton which may permeate through the crystal, allowing dimerisation of molecules within the crystal when the surface is irradiated.
Observation	In the case of the 4-chloro derivative, there is an initial period during which the slope of the graph increases before it stabilizes to give a first-order plot during the later stages of conversion.
Goal	An in situ time-dependent study of the photodimerisation of chloro-derivatives of trans-cinnamic acid using infrared microspectroscopy with a synchrotron radiation source
Background	Proper utilization of such methods is held back, however, because of a lack of understanding of reaction mechanism within single crystals.
Background	The specific choice of the chloro-derivatives was made because it is known that bigger distortions of the crystal structure are possible during the dimerisation of trans-cinnamic acid derivatives when large atoms are coordinated to the phenyl ring.6
Result	This mechanism explains how the reaction may proceed by first order kinetics even though the extinction coefficient of the monomer is so high (ε = 20 000 at λmax = 270 nm in methanolic solution).
Background	In recent publications we have demonstrated the use of infrared and Raman microspectroscopy to investigate the structures of products of the photodimerisation of derivatives of trans-cinnamic acid.5
Result	In all three cases the reactions proceed smoothly from monomer to dimer with no hint of any reaction intermediate.
Observation	Under these conditions the absorption of photons from the lamp is almost total even at very high conversions of monomer to dimer; extrapolation of the solution data indicates that even when conversion to the dimer reaches 99%, more than 99.99% of the incident photons of the appropriate wavelength and polarization will be absorbed within the thickness of the crystal.
Experiment	The crystal was subjected to UV–visible irradiation (λ = 260–570 nm) using an Oriel 100 W high pressure mercury lamp (model 6281) via a fused silica fibre-optic bundle (Oriel 77578).
Background	Further use could clearly be made of these methods to monitor reactions in situ in order to obtain information about reaction intermediates and to provide kinetic data.
Observation	It was noted that small cracks typically developed in the crystal during the course of the reaction but that the crystal remained intact.
Result	The β-form of 2,4-dichloro-trans-cinnamic acid dimerises under ultraviolet irradiation to form the corresponding β-truxinic acid derivative in a reaction which follows strictly first order kinetics.
Experiment	It has been shown elsewhere that photodimerisation proceeds by irradiation into the long-wavelength broad absorption band shown by both solid and dissolved (methanolic solution) 2,4-dichloro-trans-cinnamic acid in the range 240–300 nm.5,6
Background	Single crystal X-ray methods are often not appropriate because the crystals may degrade during the course of the reaction.3
Background	Atomic force microscopy has been used to monitor some reactions and while it allows the reaction progress to be monitored it gives no information concerning chemical structure.4
Conclusion	We now report that, in a single crystal, the β-form of 2,4-dichloro-trans-cinnamic acid dimerises under ultraviolet irradiation to form the corresponding β-truxinic acid derivative in a reaction (see Scheme 1) which follows strictly first order kinetics.
Background	A reaction mechanism of this type has previously been proposed in the photodimerisation of 4-bromo-trans-cinnamic acid.9
Object	The photodimerisation of single crystals of substituted cinnamic acid has been monitored continuously by infrared microscopy using a synchrotron source.
Experiment	It was not practical to use filters to limit the wavelength range of the incident light further because the loss of light intensity led to unacceptably long reaction times.
Method	This eliminates differences in reaction rate, which will arise from variations in the sizes of crystallites, in their orientation and distance from the light source and from overlapping such that some crystallites lie in the shadow of others if a powder sample is studied.
Observation	The slope of the graph for the 2-chloro derivative continues to increase throughout the reaction: the kinetics do in fact fit closely to the contracting cube model10 over the conversion range studied, although this may be coincidental.
Experiment	Details of the design of this line have been reported elsewhere.8
Result	By contrast the corresponding reactions in single crystals of β-2-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid and β-4-chloro-trans-cinnamic acid deviate somewhat from first order kinetics as a result of solid-state effects.
Result	The absence of such a phase in the dimerisation of the 2,4-dichloro derivative may then be explained by the smaller distortion needed to produce the dimer when two chlorine atoms, rather than one, are present on the phenyl ring.
Background	Thus a smooth conversion from monomer to dimer with no fragmentation of the crystal was anticipated.
Object	We selected derivatives of trans-cinnamic acid as our preliminary subjects for study because these reactions are well-documented and may be taken as a paradigm of single crystal organic reactions.6
Experiment	Infrared spectra were recorded at approximately 2-minute intervals until the reaction had proceeded almost to completion.
Motivation	There has never before been reported any experiment in which vibrational spectroscopy has been used to follow the time dependency of a reaction within a single organic crystal.
Result	It is entirely in line with earlier observations regarding the ability of crystal structures of trans-cinnamic acid derivatives to distort.6
Conclusion	First order kinetics reflects the fact that reaction occurs when one molecule of the monomer in the first excited state reacts with the other monomer molecule occupying the same unit cell.
Method	In order to obtain meaningful kinetic data it is, of course, necessary to follow the reaction in one single crystal.
Method	The spectra were subjected to multivariate quantitative analysis using the Nicolet TQ Analyst program with authentic samples of the monomer and dimer as standards.
Result	The existence of an induction phase during which the effective rate constant increases may be associated with increased ease of reaction when the crystal structure is distorted or the dislocation density is high.
Observation	In Fig. 1 the conversion of monomer to dimer is clearly shown by the decay in the band arising from ν(CC) (1619 cm–1) and the shift to higher frequency of the ν(CO) band (1686 to 1708 cm–1) as conjugation is lost.
Result	The presence of clear isosbestic points demonstrates a reaction that proceeds from reactant to product with no detectable intermediate.
Result	Very small shifts in the crossover of these points may be accounted for by small variations in the baseline.

Background	Caveolin-1 can exist as two isoforms differing in their N-terminus.
Goal	In this work, we investigate the association of caveolin-1 isoforms with the BMP receptors of type-II (BRII) and type-Ia (BRIa) and with the EGF receptor, ErbB1.
Conclusion	It is evident that the interaction of the receptors (BRIa and ErbB1) with the caveolin-1 isoforms is sensitive to the state of activation.
Result	In this work, we show that BMP and EGF receptors co-localize with these caveolin-1 isoforms in starved A431 cells to comparable extents.
Result	Thus, EGF stimulation leads to a redistribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform into regions enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform, since the CD of cavolon-1 α and the CD of caveolin-1 α and β are not significantly changed following EGF stimulation (p = 0.84).
Background	They exert their function by signaling through serine threonine kinase receptors.
Background	Specifically, serum starvation of A431 cells leads to the up-regulation of the BMP-type-II receptor within 72 h as seen by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and by immunofluorescence.42
Object	Caveolin-1 isoform reorganization studied by image correlation spectroscopy
Background	By serving as regions of the cell surface that can be enriched in receptors to signaling proteins, the probability of interaction among the receptors increases significantly allowing for more rapid responses.
Background	There is evidence that these isoforms play different roles in caveolae formation.9
Experiment	The values of the standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated from the raw data at the 95% confidence level.
Observation	Figs. 3A and 4A show representative examples of confocal images of selected, pair-wise labeling of a receptor and a caveolin-1 isoform.
Experiment	The polyclonal antisera against the BMP receptors, BRIa and BRII, and the polyclonal antibody against the EGF receptor were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Experiment	After collection of each set of images was finished, additional images were collected using identical settings but with the shutter to the sample closed to obtain a measure of the dark current for each PMT.
Conclusion	Most likely, BMP-2 stimulation leads to a redistribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform into regions enriched in the α isoform, since the CD of caveolin-1 α and the CD of caveolin-1 α and β are not significantly different following the BMP-2 stimulation (p = 0.14).
Conclusion	Stimulation of these starved A431 cells with either BMP-2 or EGF leads to comparable redistributions of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β isoform into caveolae containing both caveolin-1 α and β isoforms.
Observation	However, BMP-2 stimulation does not significantly change the cluster density of caveolin-1 α when detected alone by clone 2234 (p = 0.97).
Method	In order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the population properties (cluster density, fraction of co-localization) the data are pooled and averaged when more than one experiment is conducted.
Background	Caveolae enriched in caveolin-1 β are shallower than caveolae containing both caveolin-1 α and β.
Background	Caveolin-1 is expressed in two isoforms, caveolin-1 α and caveolin-1 β, that differ in their coding.
Experiment	The plasmid encoding GFP-tagged caveolin-1 β was provided by Dr H. Kogo (Department of Anatomy, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.)
Result	This suggests that the presence of excess caveolin-1 β isoform inhibits the BMP-2 signaling pathway.
Conclusion	This provided new evidence for the existence of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform only.
Background	Past work indicates that the largest source of uncertainty in the ICS and ICCS measurements arises from variations between cells in a population.
Method	To measure the distribution of the caveolin-1 on the cell surface, we employed ICS and ICCS measurements, which require acquisition of high quality fluorescence images with a laser scanning confocal microscope.
Method	We apply image correlation spectroscopy techniques to determine quantitatively the density of the receptors and the caveolin-1 isotypes as well as the extent to which they co-localize.
Experiment	Normal A431 cells were grown on 22 mm coverslips.
Experiment	Labeled cells were visualized using a Biorad MRC 600 confocal microscope equipped with an Ar/Kr mixed gas laser and using the appropriate filter sets for dual fluorophore imaging.
Conclusion	Our data suggest that the two isoforms of caveolin-1 play different roles on the cell surface and that caveolae are dynamic structures.
Background	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subfamily of the TGF beta superfamily and their response is mediated by serine/threonine kinase receptors.
Observation	However, the co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with ErbB1 is not changed significantly following EGF stimulation (p = 0.62).
Conclusion	This indicates that BRIa organization is more flexible than BRII on the cell surface..
Method	High magnification confocal images were collected and analyzed by ICCS to yield estimates of the density of receptor clusters, the density of caveolin clusters and the density of clusters that contain both receptor and caveolin (eqn. (7)).
Conclusion	This provides evidence that the caveolin-1 β isoform may inhibit signaling in caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β, suggesting that these caveolae may function to sequester the receptors in non-functional domains until they are needed, that is, they may act as storage units for the receptors.
Background	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to signal through tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family.
Background	In the case of the BMP receptors, their organization in caveolae may facilitate creation of preformed complexes of type-I and type II receptors.
Method	The technique and selected applications have been presented previously at Faraday Discussion .11139
Model	Correspondingly, F(r/g) is the fraction of red labeled protein clusters containing green labeled proteins.
Model	It is also known that for homogenous, non-interacting species, where the intensity is a true representation of the concentration, the variance of the normalized intensity fluctuations is equal to the variance of the concentration fluctuations, which in turn is equal to the inverse of the number of particles in the observation area, N̄p.41
Observation	Fig. 3B shows that prior to stimulation with BMP-2 the fraction of co-localization of caveolin-1 α, as detected with clone 2234, and BRIa is about 20% (one fifth of the caveolae contain the receptor) and that after stimulation, the fraction of co-localization is about 34% (one third of the caveolae contain the receptor).
Result	The cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β is decreased upon stimulation with BMP-2 or EGF, showing a redistribution of caveolin-1 β into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α.
Result	The combination of these observations, increase in co-localization with caveolin-1 α and no change with both, indicates that less caveolin-1 β co-localizes with BRIa following stimulation with BMP-2.
Result	This suggests that the change in cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β arises from changes in the distribution of the caveolin-1 β isoform.
Observation	Stimulation by BMP-2 increases the co-localization by about 43% (p = 3.4 × 10−7).
Experiment	A431 cells grown in 60 mm dishes were co-transfected with the plasmid containing a Smad Binding Element (pSBE), which is sensitive to the activation of the BMP signaling pathway, a Renilla luciferase reporter construct (which is used for normalization of the chemiluminescence response) and the caveolin-1 β construct using Fugene6 (Boehringer).
Model	The CD value is an estimate of the average number of receptor clusters per unit area i.e., 
Background	Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations of the cell membrane, which are thought to play a crucial role in endocytosis, signaling and intracellular cholesterol transport.1–3
Model	The amplitude of the function obtained from this fit gives the best estimate of g(0,0) for that image.
Observation	In contrast, the co-localzation of caveolin-1 α and β, detected with clone 2297 and BRIa is not significantly affected BMP-2 stimulation remaining at about 26–27% (p = 0.95).
Experiment	After blocking for 30 min with 5% BSA, the cells were incubated with polyclonal antisera recognizing either BRII or BRIa, with polyclonal antibody recognizing the EGFR, or with antibodies recognizing caveolin-1 α (clone 2234) or caveolin-1 α and β (clone 2297) according to manufacturers protocols.
Experiment	The experiments are designed to collect a large number of images, typically forty, each from a different cell in the sample.
Model	In this case, the two-dimensional cross-correlation function is obtained by first calculating the Fourier transform of each of the two images, then cross-multiplying the real part from the green image with the imaginary part from the red image (or the imaginary part from the green image with the real part from the red image, the result is the same) and finally calculating the reverse Fourier transform of the ‘mixed’ power spectrum.
Experiment	The antibodies recognizing only caveolin-1 α (clone 2234) or both of the caveolin-1 α and β isoforms (clone 2297) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (New York, NY, USA).
Background	Removal of the serum, serum starvation, is used to isolate the effect of a specific growth factor on cell signaling, but can also affect the receptor concentration on the cell surface by up- or down-regulation at the gene expression level or through altered turn over through endocytosis.
Background	Caveolin-1, 2 and 3 are key proteins, which are important for the formation of the invaginations on the cell surface.
Model	The resulting two-dimensional autocorrelation function is then fit to a two-dimensional gaussian function of known width (corresponding to the width of the laser beam at the focal point of confocal microscope).
Method	The percent of caveolin-1 co-localizing with the BMP or EGF receptors was estimated using eqn. (8).
Experiment	The cells were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min and afterwards, they were incubated with the corresponding fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies at a concentration of 20 μg mL−1.
Background	It has been shown for individual molecules that the zero-lag amplitude of the cross-correlation function reflects the extent of co-localization of the two chromophores on the cell surface.35,36
Model	Also, gg(0,0) and gr(0,0) are the autocorrelation functions corresponding to the individual green and red images.
Experiment	The A431 cell line (CRL 1555) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassa, VA, USA).).
Method	We, therefore, examined the extent of co-localization of the receptors with each of the caveolin-1 isoforms using image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS).
Experiment	All the data in a particular experiment are normalized to this same data set.
Method	Image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS) are two techniques that can be used to study the distribution and localization of receptors.33–38
Experiment	Specifically, we co-transfected pSBE (with a Renilla luciferase construct) into A431 cells since the pSBE is known to be responsive to the activation of BMP signaling.43
Method	ICS involves autocorrelation analysis of the intensity fluctuations within confocal images collected, in this case, from cells that contain immunofluorescently labeled proteins.
Experiment	After transfection, the cells were stimulated, or not stimulated, for 12 h with 20 nM BMP-2, lysed and the luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Goal	Here we report on the aggregation and association of caveolin-1 isoforms with these receptors and the effect of BMP and EGF activation on caveolin-1 distribution in A431 cells.
Observation	However, co-expression of caveolin-1 β with the pSBE in A431 cells leads to a decrease in luciferase activity back to the level of unstimulated A431 cells even when they are stimulated with BMP-2.
Result	It is evident that the extent of co-localization is less than 100% and therefore some of the receptors are outside the caveolae and some of the caveolae contain no receptors.
Background	BMPs need to bind to at least one type-I and one type-II receptor in order to activate the Smad or p38 pathways.18–28
Method	We interpret the amplitude to reflect the average number of clusters with both chromophores present.
Experiment	The cells were then fixed and labeled for the caveolin-1 isoforms using a monoclonal antibody against caveolin-1 α or a monoclonal antibody recognizing both α and β isoforms followed by a secondary fluorescent antibody.
Hypothesis	It is possible that the caveolin-1 β enriched domains serve this function.
Background	It is known that BMP receptors can form preformed complexes between BRIa and BRII prior to BMP-2 binding, but these preformed complexes do not signal in the absence of BMP-2.
Hypothesis	In other words, the preformed complexes are inhibited by caveolin-1 β and the inhibition is released as a consequence of the redistribution of the caveolin-1 β in response to the BMP-2.
Result	This observation is parallel to that observed for BRIa in Fig. 3B and the conclusion is equivalent: Stimulation of A431 cells by EGF causes the redistribution of caveolin-1 β into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α and the increase in caveolin-1 α co-localization with ErbB1 provides evidence for the existence of caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform and ErbB1.
Background	Here we provide a brief overview of the techniques and their interpretation.
Conclusion	This demonstrates that caveolae are dynamic structures on the cell surface whose composition may change to influence the signaling activity.
Conclusion	Our data, obtained by application of a family of image correlation spectroscopy tools, indicate that BMP and EGF stimulation lead to a rearrangement of the caveolin-1 isoforms on the cell surface.
Result	This is consistent with the previous studies on the ErbB1 that show that interaction of caveolin-1 with the EGF receptor inhibits receptor kinase activity, although in that work it was not attributed specifically to the caveolin-1 β isoform44.
Experiment	Accordingly, we transfected the A431 cells with the caveolin-1 β isoform causing an overexpression.
Model	The resulting cross-correlation function is fit to a two-dimensional gaussian as above to give the amplitude of the cross correlation function, ggr(0,0).
Experiment	The cells were exposed to BMP-2 for 2.5 h or to 100 ng mL−1 of EGF for 30 min.
Observation	Fig. 1B indicates that BMP-2 stimulation of starved A431 cells leads to a 39% decrease in the cluster density of caveolin-1 α and β as detected by labeling with the caveolin-1 antibody clone 2297 (p = 8.75 × 10−5).
Conclusion	Whatever the purpose, it is evident that there is an active and dynamic redistribution of caveolin-1 on the cell surface following BMP or EGF stimulation.
Background	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play crucial roles during embryonic development in chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, neurogenesis and hematopoiesis.10–17
Observation	Correspondingly, Fig. 2B shows that EGF stimulation leads to a 37% decrease in the cluster density of the caveolin-1 α and β isoform (detected by clone 2297) (p = 0.013) and that the stimulation with EGF does not significantly alter the cluster density of the caveolin-1 α isoform (detected by clone 2234) (p = 0.96).
Experiment	Cells were washed again three times for 5 min with PBS and the coverslips were mounted on airvol and dried overnight.
Hypothesis	Since the BMP-2 and EGF stimulation cause the same effect, the first step is to determine whether there is inhibition of the BMP signaling when the interaction with the caveolin-1 β isoform is enhanced.
Observation	Figs. 1A and 2A show representative confocal images at high magnification (zoom 10 provides 15.5 μm × 15.5 μm images).
Hypothesis	Since BRII is a constitutively active kinase there must be a mechanism whereby the transphosphorylation of BRIa by BRII is silenced in the absence of BMP stimulation.
Experiment	We then used a reporter gene assay to examine the influence of this overexpression on the activation of the Smad signaling pathway.
Experiment	Fifteen scans were accumulated on photomultiplier tube 2 (PMT2) in the photon counting mode (to ensure linear scaling of the intensity).
Model	Once the g(0,0) value is known, an important parameter, called the cluster density (CD) can be calculated by eqn. (4).
Method	In practice, the two-dimensional autocorrelation function for the image is obtained by first calculating the Fourier transform of the image, then calculating the power spectrum (by multiplying the real and the imaginary components of the transform) and finally calculating the reverse Fourier transform.
Experiment	Serum starved A431 cells, stimulated or not stimulated with BMP-2 or EGF, were fixed and the BMP receptors, EGF receptors and caveolin-1 isoforms were labeled using the specific antibodies against the proteins of interest and appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies.
Result	We demonstrate that overexpression of the caveolin β isoform in starved A431 cells leads to an inhibition of BMP-2 induced signaling.
Background	In the absence of the serum, cells divide less frequently, but grow well for up to one week.
Result	Fig. 3B also shows that BMP-2 stimulation does not significantly change the fraction of co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with BRII, irrespective of which antibody is used to detect the caveolin-1 (clone 2297 or clone 2234) (p = 0.96 for clone 2234 and p = 0.98 for clone 2297).
Observation	Fig. 4B shows that EGF stimulation increases the co-localization of caveolin-1 α with ErbB1 by about 50% (p = 2.93 × 10−5).
Result	We are further able to show that the co-localization of BRIa with caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 β isoform is decreased upon BMP-2 stimulation.
Background	Caveolin-1, 2 and 3 are the key proteins involved in the formation of the invaginations.4–6
Background	They are thought to play a crucial role in cell signaling, endocytosis and intracellular cholesterol transport.
Experiment	Following 72 h of serum-starvation, the A431 cells were stimulated, or not stimulated, with 20 nM BMP-2 for 2.5 h or 100 ng mL−1 EGF for 30 min and fixed using acetone/methanol fixation.32
Hypothesis	Since EGF and BMP mediate their signal through receptors that act respectively as serine threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases, it is likely that the influence on the caveolae compositions are caused by direct interactions with the caveolins, rather than through their respective signaling events.
Method	One receptor type is labeled with a green probe and is imaged to give the intensity map, ig(x,y), while the second receptor type is labeled with a red probe and imaged to give the intensity map, ir(x,y).
Background	Caveolae are small, flask shaped invaginations in the cell membrane.
Background	There is increasing evidence that domains on the cell surface exist to act as sites for protein–protein interactions leading to activation of specific signaling pathways.
Hypothesis	An analogous inhibitory effect may be exerted on the ErbB1 receptor.
Background	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is in part responsible for the proliferation of cells and exerts its function by signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to the activation of the Map kinase (Mapk) pathways.29–31
Model	If the fluorescence intensity in a pixel, located at position (x,y) in the image, is i(x,y), then the corresponding normalized fluorescence intensity fluctuation, δi(x,y), is given by: The normalized spatial autocorrelation function, g(ξ,η), is then given by: g(ξ,η) = 〈δi(x,y)δi(x + ξ,y + η)〉where the angular brackets indicate the average over all spatial coordinates and ξ and η are position lag coordinates for the x and y axes in the image.
Model	It is known that the limit of the autocorrelation function as ξ and η approach zero, g(0,0), is equal to the variance of the normalized intensity fluctuations.40
Model	The normalized, spatial cross-correlation function can be calculated as: ggr(ξ,η) = 〈δig(x,y)δir(x +ξ,y + η)〉
Experiment	A431 cells were starved for 72 h and then stimulated (or not stimulated in control experiments) with the desired signaling protein.
Experiment	The filter wheel was set for 488 nm laser excitation to measure Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence, and neutral density filters were used to attenuate the laser to 1% laser power.
Result	Using a reporter gene assay sensitive to the activation of the BMP pathway, we show that overexpression of caveolin-1 β inhibits signaling.
Method	The average cluster density was calculated for this large number of images in order to obtain good population statistics.
Experiment	The secondary antibodies, donkey anti-goat RRX and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA).
Conclusion	The fact that both BMP-2 and EGF induce the same redistribution of caveolin-1 suggests that the phenomenon may be general and that the redistribution is functionally important in the signaling process.
Background	Interactions between receptors and regulatory proteins within the domains can, in principle, lead to either activation or inhibition of the corresponding signaling pathways.
Result	Similarly, we show that stimulation with EGF leads to an increase in the co-localization of caveolin-1 α with ErbB1, whereas the co-localization of caveolin-1 α and β with ErbB1 remains unchanged.
Background	Caveolin-1 exists in two isoforms: caveolin-1 alpha (α) and caveolin-1 beta (β).
Hypothesis	The implication is that BMP-2 stimulation may form caveolae enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform and BRIa.
Experiment	An area on the cell, removed from the nucleus, was enlarged and recorded at the zoom 10 setting.
Model	The only caveat is that the interpretation of eqn. (6) is strictly only valid for individual chromophores.
Motivation	It is, therefore, important to study protein–protein interactions within these domains and to determine whether these interactions can change.
Background	The serum provides some nutrients, but most importantly, a series of growth factors that stimulate cell proliferation.
Background	Still, the two caveolin-1 isoforms have a common hydrophobic stretch of amino acids, a scaffolding domain and an acetylated C-terminus.7,8
Background	They are distributed slightly differently on the cell surface, and previous work suggests that there are caveolae composed only (or mainly) of the β isoform as well as caveolae with both isoforms present.9
Result	We further show that about 20–30% of the caveolin-1 present at the surface of the cells co-localize with the EGF and BMP receptors.
Motivation	Little is known about the difference between these two isoforms, and less in known about their role in cell signaling.
Result	Upon stimulation, the receptors are released from the caveolin-1 β inhibitory effect as the caveolin-1 β redistributes.
Experiment	Normally cells are grown in a culture medium to which 10% fetal bovine serum is added.
Method	In ICCS, a cross-correlation function is also generated to measure the coincident fluorescence intensity fluctuations in images collected from two different chromophores attached to two different proteins or receptor types.
Observation	This observation is the same as that observed following BMP-2 stimulation.
Model	By rearrangement, we can define a cluster density of co-localized chromophores as: The fraction of each protein type associated with the other type can finally be estimated by looking at the appropriate ratios of CD values: In eqn. (8), F(g/r) represents the fraction of green labeled protein clusters which contain red labeled proteins.
Background	The BMP and EGF receptors were labeled with donkey anti goat Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated secondary antibodies, whereas the caveolin-1 isoforms were labeled using goat anti mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies.
Conclusion	BMP as well as EGF stimulation leads to a rearrangement of the caveolin-1 β isoform into domains enriched in the caveolin-1 α isoform.
Method	It can be seen that ICCS provides quantitative information about the extent of co-localization of two different receptors, or in the current work, a receptor and a binding protein.
Hypothesis	Since EGF stimulation causes a redistribution of caveolin-1 β it is possible that it is this isoform that specifically causes the inhibition and that the redistribution is intended to remove the inhibitory effect to allow signaling to take place.
Goal	Generally, we aim to understand whether stimulation of a cell with receptor specific ligands influences the receptor distribution or the caveolin composition within the caveolae.
Model	Specifically: Here, N̄g, N̄r and N̄gr are the average number of clusters which are made up of only green labeled proteins, only red labeled proteins, and both green and red labeled proteins, respectively.
Background	Image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS) is an extension of ICS.
Experiment	The filter wheel was then shifted to allow excitation with the 568 nm laser line for Alexa Fluor 568 fluorescence, and 20 scans were accumulated on PMT1 for BMP receptors, whereas 9 scans were accumulated on PMT1 for the EGF receptor (EFGR).
Observation	As Fig. 5 shows, BMP-2 stimulation leads to a four-fold increase in luciferase activity in these starved cells.
Method	These are calculated from the individual images as indicated above.
Experiment	Each of the photomultiplier tubes were set to a black level of 6.0 on the vernier scale and a gain setting of 10.
Experiment	The significance of changes relative to the control was assessed by paired, two-tailed t-tests.
Experiment	Cells expressing the receptors were selected under mercury lamp illumination using a 60 × (1.4 numerical aperture) objective on an inverted Nikon microscope.
Experiment	In all cases, the cluster density data are represented relative to the value for one, selected control experiment.
Background	However, unless the caveolae are specific to particular receptor families, the high density of receptors in the domain could lead to interaction between different receptor systems and hence cross-talk between otherwise distinct signaling pathways.
Conclusion	As described above, stimulation of A431 cells with BMP or EGF influences the aggregation of caveolin-1 β and appears to lead to changes in the composition of the caveolae.
Background	Previous studies have shown that the interaction between the EGF receptor (ErbB1) and caveolin leads to inhibition of the kinase activity of the receptor.
Background	Further, starved A431 cells are sensitive to both BMP-2 and EGF stimulation whereas normal A431 cells are less sensitive to BMP-2 stimulation.
Experiment	Recombinant BMP-2 was obtained from Wyeth (Boston, NY, USA) and human recombinant EGF was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Conclusion	Evidently, EGF and BMP-2 cause comparable changes in the caveolin isoform redistribution: in both cases the caveolin-1 β isoform is reorganized into domains enriched in caveolin-1 α following exposure to the signaling protein.
Method	Forty high magnification images of flat regions of the cell surface were collected from forty separate cells and subjected to ICS analysis to provide a cluster density for each image (eqn. (4)).

Method	This method, however, was troublesome and time-consuming and required expensive large equipment.
Method	By this method, microchannels and dam were simultaneously created only with a simple one-step etching.
Result	The sample containing 0.1 ng mL−1 (6 pM) IFN had a clear TLM signal, whereas the determination limit by the microchip immunoassay using colloidal gold as a labeling material was 1 ng mL−1 (60 pM).
Result	In the colloidal gold method, measurements of 5–10 beads and averaging were necessary for one assay, because signal intensity obtained from each bead varied greatly.
Experiment	Therefore, in this study, every reaction time was fixed at 10 min.
Method	The transmitted beams were collected by a condenser lens and filtered.
Observation	Moreover, detection of the enzyme reaction product in the liquid phase with the TLM was much easier than detection of the colloidal gold fixed on the surface of the beads, and no special instrumental operating skills were necessary.
Experiment	Phosphate buffer (PB; 1/15 M, pH 7.4) was prepared from phosphate buffer powder (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and ultra pure water, and the buffer was filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane filter prior to use.
Method	Immunoassay, represented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is a well-known and important analytical method in the life sciences.
Result	For the best reproducible results, reagent concentration was set at 1 µg mL−1 or 10 µg mL−1 for the biotinylated second antibody or the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate, respectively.
Model	Therefore a large S/V is favorable for high amplification rate of the enzyme reaction, which means high signal intensity.
Motivation	Hence, the procedures for detection were very troublesome and time-consuming and good instrumental skills were necessary.
Goal	IFN was determined with the developed microELSA system.
Motivation	To determine very small amounts of the enzyme reaction product in a microchannel, a highly sensitive detection method with high space resolution is indispensable.
Result	Not only the reaction rate, but the thermal lens signal was also affected by the solution temperature; higher temperatures led to the higher signals.
Experiment	To prevent nonspecific binding of proteins to the microchannel and capillary tubes, 0.2% casein (Merck, biochemistry grade) in PB, 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PB, or BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) was used as a blocking reagent.
Method	The resulting product, dissolved in the solution, was pushed downstream by the syringe pump and detected with the TLM.
Model	For the dam structure, a photomask with a gapped channel pattern was used (Fig. 2A).
Method	It is an indispensable technique in biochemistry and clinical diagnosis fields because of its extremely high specificity and sensitivity.
Observation	Furthermore, because obtained data were rather dispersed, improvement of the lower limit of determination was very difficult.
Background	Therefore microchips made by both one-step and two-step methods could be used for the assays.
Conclusion	Therefore we concluded that the best flow rate of each solution was 0.02 µL min−1.
Method	In that paper, we showed the reaction time necessary for an antigen-antibody reaction was reduced to 1/90 in the integrated system, because of size effects of the liquid microspace.
Model	The chip had two inlet holes, a Y-shaped channel, a dam, a detection area, and an outlet hole (Fig. 3).
Experiment	This procedure was repeated until the packed bead channel (1 cm in length) was completely filled.
Background	The most critical problem was a considerable increase of backpressure at the solution introduction procedure.
Method	For smaller beads, the two-step method was suitable, because the second etching process for the dam was fully controllable.
Experiment	The monoclonal anti-IFN solution (100 µL, 50 µg mL−1) was added to the polystyrene beads (10 µL solid), and the suspension was stirred gently at room temperature for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C.
Method	For easy and rapid fabrication of the chip, we developed a one-step or two-step wet etching method in which the chip was fabricated by simply combining standard photolithography and wet chemical etching techniques.
Method	The conventional heterogeneous immunoassay, however, has a relatively long assay time, and involves troublesome liquid-handling procedures and many expensive antibody reagents.
Hypothesis	Improvement of the detection scheme is effective to realize higher throughput and more precise assay.
Experiment	For capture antibody, chromatographically purified mouse anti-recombinant human interferon-γ monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems Inc.) was used.
Method	For the two-step method, the microchannel and dam were fabricated individually by using a different photomask for each.
Method	Moreover, automated assay systems used for clinical diagnoses require rather large apparatuses.
Experiment	After the measurement, the beads were removed from the microchip by a reverse flow of PB and the microchannel was washed with 0.1 M NaOH solution.
Hypothesis	A microchip-based system is potentially an effective way to realize a highly sensitive analysis system which overcomes these drawbacks.
Model	In our microELISA system, the enzyme reaction time was inversely proportional to the flow rate because the volume of the reaction area was fixed.
Experiment	Solution flow rates were adjusted to 100 µL min−1 for PB washing and for solution exchange, and they were 1 µL min−1 for the other reagents during the reaction.
Background	In our previous paper, we used microbeads with 45 µm diameter for the microchip immunoassay using colloidal gold as a labeling material, because it is very difficult to focus a laser beam on the top of small beads.
Observation	The enzyme reaction could be performed in both continuous flow and stopped flow modes.
Method	After photolithography, the gapped narrow window was opened on a Pyrex glass surface, and then the glass substrate was etched isotropically with HF solution.
Experiment	Before the assay, the inner walls of the capillaries and the microchannel were blocked with the blocking reagent for 1 h, and then this was replaced with PB.
Goal	We monitored the signal intensity of the enzyme reaction product at various temperatures to get the temperature dependency of the reaction rate (Fig. 5).
Model	To introduce the beads pre-coated with anti-IFN into the microchip, an aliquot of the bead suspension was placed in one inlet hole of the microchip, and then the beads were moved to the dam region by suction from the outlet hole while the other inlet was kept closed (Fig. 3).
Background	However, improvement of the total throughput of the assay was limited because of difficulties with the detection.
Experiment	For the second antibodies, biotinylated anti-recombinant interferon-γ polyclonal antibody from goats (R&D Systems Inc.) was used.
Model	Two channels with curved surface were connected slightly at the center of the image.
Method	Although the method had high sensitivity, the precision was poor because of the difficulty in focusing the laser onto the top of spherical surface and the heterogeneity of the protein adsorption and antigen-antibody reaction on the small areas of the beads.
Method	Microchip-based immunosorbent assay using colloidal gold as a labeling material was performed as described previously7.
Conclusion	Moreover, detection procedures were greatly simplified and required time for the detection was significantly cut.
Method	Excess beads were washed out by flushing PB from one inlet to the other inlet.
Experiment	0.46).
Method	All reactions required for the immunoassay were done in the microchannel by successive introduction of a sample and regents.
Result	In the stopped flow mode, after the microchannel including the packed bead area was completely filled with the substrate solutions, the enzyme reaction proceeded for an appropriate time with the liquid flow stopped.
Method	Using this method, the microchannel and the dam were individually fabricated.
Object	Microchip-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (microELISA) system with thermal lens detection
Method	Two separate narrow channels appeared at first; these became wider and deeper and then came to connect to one channel with a neck as etching proceeded.
Observation	However, accurate control of the channel depth of the dam was technically difficult for a narrow neck especially at depth of less than 10 µm because of unstable etching rate.
Model	In the microELISA system, however, specific interface area (S/V), which is defined as surface area of the beads to liquid phase volume ratio, is very important for enzyme reaction rate, because S/V is directly proportional to the amount of the enzyme fixed in the chip.
Method	In the continuous flow mode, two substrate solutions, a mixture of TOOS and H2O2, and an AA solution, were introduced from two inlets with the same flow rate.
Model	Finally enzyme reaction substrate solutions were continuously pumped into the channel (Fig. 1-5), while monitoring the reaction product with the TLM positioned downstream (Fig. 1-6).
Experiment	4-aminoantipyrine (AA) and H2O2 solution were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical and N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3-methylaniline, sodium salt (TOOS) was from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan).
Background	Moreover, we applied this system to a clinical diagnosis system, which is based on a determination of a major tumor marker for colon cancer known as human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).5
Method	Because premixing of the three substrates might bring about some undesirable progression of the reaction outside of the chip without the enzyme, substrates were introduced from two inlets separately; one solution was a mixture of TOOS and H2O2, and the other was AA.
Model	The structure image of the dam region is shown in Fig. 2B.
Experiment	The excitation beam was the 532 nm emission line of a YAG laser (CrystaLaser, Reno, NV, model GCL-100-S) with output power of 76 mW, and its intensity was modulated by a mechanical chopper with a modulation frequency at 1.03 kHz.
Method	The system provided rapid and sensitive determination and showed a high correlation with the conventional assay in practical measurements of patients' sera.
Observation	By using 25 µm beads, a strong signal could be obtained without any problems.
Model	Precise control to the optimum temperature is recommended for reliable and highly sensitive determination.
Hypothesis	Integration of analytical systems into a microchip should bring about enhanced reaction efficiency, simplified procedures, shortened assay time, and lowered consumption of samples, reagents, and energy.
Method	A mixture of TOOS and H2O2 was introduced from one inlet and AA was introduced from the other, all at the same flow rate.
Background	Moreover, removal of air bubbles, which accidentally contaminated the packed bead region, was also very difficult in the case of smaller beads.
Observation	The Y-shaped channel was suitable not only for mixing of the substrate solutions, but also for packing a definite amount of beads in the microchannel easily.
Conclusion	By adopting the ELISA in the multichannel system, measurements can be made in a lot of channels laid in parallel, simultaneously or successively in a very short time.
Hypothesis	Since the plotted temperatures were surface temperatures of the temperature control stage of the microscope, actual solution temperature might be lower.
Conclusion	The system has good potential to be developed as a small and automated high throughput analyzer.
Result	In total, 35 min were required for the microELISA including three reactions and detection, while several hours or one day would be required in the conventional bulk-scale ELISA or 40–90 min in the colloidal gold-based microchip immunoassay.
Method	The enzyme reaction product, in a liquid phase, was detected downstream in the channel using the TLM as substrate solution was injected.
Observation	The microchannel was 200 µm and 90 µm in width and depth, respectively, whereas the depth of the dam region was dependent on each experiment.
Background	Additionally no special skills were needed for the assay.
Method	Most were preliminary reports that only mentioned the possibility of immunosorbent assay or an antigen-antibody reaction in a microfabricated device, however, we described a microchip-based immunosorbent assay system for determinations of some proteins with high sensitivity.2
Method	Only the probe beam intensity was monitored with a photodiode.
Conclusion	From this result, we concluded that the optimum temperature of the stage during the enzyme reaction was 55 °C.
Conclusion	Therefore this method was suitable for beads with a diameter greater than 20 µm.
Experiment	AA, H2O2 and TOOS are reacted by catalysis of HRP to produce red-colored product.
Model	Next, PB, biotinylated anti-IFN, PB, and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate were injected into the microchannel successively from the inlet (Fig. 1).
Model	Schematic illustrations of our bead-bed microELISA system are shown in Fig. 1.
Experiment	During the enzyme reaction, the microchip temperature was controlled with a PE120 Peltier Heating and Freezing Stage (Linkam Scientific Instruments, Surrey, UK) which was mounted on the TLM.
Background	Some papers have reported on miniaturization of ELISA or immunosorbent assay systems, in which antigen and antibodies are fixed on a solid surface in a microchip.1–11
Background	Although bead diameter is apparently inversely proportional to S/V, smaller beads often led to problems in the assay.
Method	The system was composed of a microchip with a Y-shaped microchannel and a dam structure, polystyrene microbeads, and a thermal lens microscope (TLM).
Method	Injection of a reagent or a sample solution was from an inlet using the syringe pump.
Experiment	Then, sample solution containing IFN was introduced from one inlet into the packed bead channel at 1 µL min−1 for 10 min for the first antigen-antibody reaction.
Experiment	The antigen-antibody reactions and the biotin-avidin reaction were done with a 10 min injection of sample solution, the biotinylated second antibody solution, and the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate solution, respectively, with a flow rate of 1 µL min−1, followed by 30 s washing with PB at 100 µL min−1.
Result	In the present microELISA system, the time to achieve equilibrium for the antigen-antibody reaction or the biotin-avidin reaction was also 10 min (data not shown).
Model	Next, a sample containing an antigen (Fig. 1-2), a biotinylated second antibody (Fig. 1-3), and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Fig. 1-4) were introduced into the channel, successively.
Method	Next, photoresists that remained on the dam area were removed by the second photolithography and then the appeared glass substrate was etched to become the dam structure.
Result	Reproducible results, however, could not be obtained due to significant molecular diffusion of the product and difficulty of completely stopping the liquid flow.
Observation	Maximum signal intensity was obtained at 55 °C.
Method	In the last step of the microELISA, the reaction of the HRP with TOOS, AA, and H2O2 was carried out in the packed bead area of the microchip.
Hypothesis	Though the microELISA was demonstrated here to be useful in a single channel assay, its merits will be fully exploited in a parallel multichannel system.
Method	The two solutions were mixed in the packed bead area (1 cm long) which was from the mixing point of the Y-shaped channel to the dam.
Result	After detailed studies, we concluded that the optimum bead diameter was 25 µm in our system.
Method	Signal intensity was recorded after reaching a plateau.
Method	In the system, colloidal gold fixed on the surface of microbeads via an antigen-antibody complex was detected by focused laser beams.
Hypothesis	We expected that the optimum amplification could be easily obtained by changing the reaction time with minimum consumption of reagents.
Method	In our previous paper, we reported a two-step fabrication method, i.e. the combination of laser abrasion for microchannel formation and dry etching by a fast atom beam for dam structure formation.
Method	The one-step method required only one photomask, one photolithography and one etching process to fabricate both a microchannel and dam.
Observation	The calibration curves of IFN are shown in Fig. 6.
Method	The dam structure was fabricated by the one-step or two-step wet etching method.
Observation	Therefore 10–60 min were required for detection of one sample, and the required time was dependent on the packing conditions of the beads and instrument operator's skill.
Experiment	Because the product has strong absorption at ∼530 nm, it is suitable for TLM detection using aYAG laser.
Method	The capillaries for reagent introduction were connected to syringes, and the outlet capillary was connected to a syringe for suction or to a waste reservoir.
Background	In addition, we succeeded in doing a simultaneous assay of multiple samples with a microchip which had branching parallel multichannels.7
Experiment	The two beams were made coaxial by a dichroic mirror, and tightly focused by an objective lens (Nikon, CF IC EPI Plan 20×, N.A.
Background	A dam structure is necessary to pack a definite amount of the microbeads in the microchip.
Observation	Clearly, a slower flow rate brought a longer reaction time and higher signal intensity (Fig. 4).
Model	Polystyrene beads pre-coated with a capture antibody were put into the reaction channel of the ELISA microchip (Fig. 1-1).
Experiment	Anti-IFN coated beads were prepared in a 500 µL microtube.
Object	A microchip-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (microELISA) system was developed and interferon-γ was successfully determined.
Model	Turnover of the enzyme reaction is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature.
Background	A glass microchip suitable for ELISA was designed and fabricated.
Experiment	All antibodies and the antigen were diluted with PB and used without further purification.
Observation	On the contrary, in the microELISA system proposed in this paper, the measured signal was derived from all the beads, and then there was very little variation during the measurement.
Method	We have developed a laser-induced thermal lens microscope (TLM), which is especially useful for ultra sensitive determination in a microspace.13,14
Method	Fused silica capillaries were connected to inlet and outlet holes of the microchip.
Method	The TLM was comprised of a microscope with two laser-oscillation apparatuses and other optical devices.
Result	Hence, only 10 s was required for measurement of one sample, though a 2–3 min wait was required for the signal to reach a plateau.
Background	The basic etching procedures were described previously.12
Background	The high sensitivity of our microchip-based immunoassay system was attributable to the combination of a good labeling material, i.e. colloidal gold nanoparticles, and an ultra high sensitive detector, a thermal lens microscope (TLM).
Conclusion	If the detection operations become easier and no special skills are required for the determination, an automated detector becomes possible.
Conclusion	Therefore, throughput of the detection will be much improved.
Conclusion	Therefore, we concluded the stopped flow method was not suitable for the current assay system.
Background	The former mask had a wider gap than that of the one-step method for dam region.
Experiment	The coated beads were washed with PB and blocked with 0.2% casein solution for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PB and stored at 4 °C.
Method	In this paper, an ELISA system was integrated into a microchip, in which peroxidase was used as a labeling material instead of colloidal gold and an enzyme reaction product was detected in a microchannel with the TLM.
Experiment	Polystyrene bead (Polybead polystyrene microspheres, 15 µm, 20 µm, and 25 µm in diameter with 1% CV) suspensions were obtained from Polysciences (Warrington, PA).
Background	The reaction time required for the antigen-antibody reaction was remarkably cut in the bead-bed microchip-based immunoassay system as described previously.
Conclusion	Detecting the reaction product in a solution was much easier to do than making surface measurements and determination limit was improved by adoption of the enzyme label due to amplification of the signals derived by the enzyme reaction.
Experiment	Recombinant human interferon-γ (IFN) was obtained from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN).
Conclusion	Therefore, by adoption of the enzyme, the work burden was greatly reduced.
Conclusion	The limit of the determination was improved by adopting the enzyme label.
Background	The first wet etching was terminated before the two channels were connected.
Method	The antigen-antibody reaction time was shortened by the microchip integration.
Experiment	The beads were washed with PB prior to use.
Result	With the microELISA system, a rapid and sensitive assay of a protein could be realized.
Result	It is, however, very difficult to realize a constant stable flow at low flow rate, typically slower than 0.01 µL min−1 for each solution, because of poor performance of the microsyringe pump.
Method	After the reaction, the solution in the microchannel was replaced with PB, and then substrate solutions were introduced from inlet holes.
Method	A change of supplied reagents could be achieved simply by changing syringes.
Background	We expect an automated multichannel analyzer can be realized on the basis of the microELISA system in the near future.
Experiment	Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Background	In the previous colloidal gold method, the multichannel system could realize high throughput assays due to simultaneous reactions.7
Method	In the one-step method, the microchannel and dam were fabricated simultaneously.
Method	The resulting product was continuously detected using the TLM downstream.
Background	This automated microELISA system will be a small, high throughput, and high sensitivity system and it will be suitable for ubiquitous assays including point-of care testing.
Experiment	A He–Ne laser (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA, model 05LHP171, 15 mW) with an emission line of 632.8 nm was used for the probe beam.
Experiment	The pre-amplified signal from the photodiode was synchronously amplified with a lock-in amplifier LI-575 (NF Corp., Yokohama, Japan).
Model	Beads can be retained one side of the dam region.
Method	Thus, the microchip could be used repeatedly.
Conclusion	By using an enzyme as a labeling material, laborious detection tasks were eliminated, and assay time and data error were reduced.
Experiment	The liquid flow was controlled with a microsyringe pump (KD Scientific, Boston, MA) and Hamilton gastight syringes with untreated fused silica capillary tubing and capillary column connectors (GL Science, Tokyo, Japan).
Method	Therefore, for determination of one sample, 5–10 beads had to be measured with the TLM while the laser was successively focused on the top of each bead and then the average was taken.
Background	Any dimensions of the microchannel and dam could be altered by changing the gap width of the photomask and etching time.
Method	The etched substrate was laminated with a cover plate, which had reagent inlet and outlet holes using a thermal fusion bonding method as described previously12.
Background	Whereas, the reaction time required for the antigen-antibody reaction was sharply cut by microchip integration, reduction of the total assay time was limited because of the troublesome detection procedures.
Experiment	The enzymatic reaction was performed at 55 °C with a flow rate of 0.02 µL min−1.

Background	However, by studying the shape of biomolecules in the gas phase, the environmental effects can be eliminated, allowing the molecule-solvent interaction to be studied in a controlled environment.
Background	The DMA model uses atomic multipoles up to hexadecapole, derived from ab initio wavefunctions (MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p) for water, MP2/6-311G** for adrenaline), and includes all terms in the atom–atom multipole expansion up to Rab−5.
Background	The functional groups of the catecholamine neurotransmitters (the catecholic hydroxyls, the chain OH and NH groups, and the π electron cloud) provide many possible water-binding sites.
Model	We re-optimised the hydrogen-bond lengths with counterpoise corrections for a selection of the AG3b–H2O minima (see Table 3 for the resulting interaction energies and Fig. 9 for the hydrogen-bond distances).
Background	In addition, the individual energy calculations become much more computationally demanding.
Motivation	We therefore need to find a computationally cheap, but reliable, method for exploring the potential energy surface of the A–(H2O)n (n > 1) clusters.
Result	The effect is very small for the B3LYP calculations, but the MP2/DZPi interaction energies are increased by 2.2–2.4 kJ mol−1.
Background	It would be very interesting to see which A and PA conformers are formed in supersonic jet experiments.
Conclusion	Thus, the model potential calculations can only be used as a guiding tool to find the most stable hydrates, as its rigid-body character prevents any water-induced conformational changes.
Background	As discussed in our recent paper on NA–H2O,2 there are two possible choices for the geometry of the free adrenaline.
Observation	The MP2fit/DMA rigid-body model potential, which contains an accurate DMA model to describe the electrostatic energy contribution to the potential energy, correctly predicts all AG1c–H2O and AG3b–H2O structures.
Observation	The resulting interaction energies are given in parentheses in Table 2.
Background	Earlier work on uracil-(H2O)2 and uracil-(H2O)3 showed that the MP2fit/DMA potential yields good agreement with ab initio (MP2/DZPi) interaction energies and hydrogen-bond distances, despite the lack of many-body terms in the potential model.21
Background	This was also observed for caffeic acid7 for which the Cδ-syn conformers were found to have a slightly lower energy than the Cδ-trans conformers.
Result	In the most stable AG3b–H2O structure the water molecule is bound as a proton donor to the chain nitrogen.
Result	In the most stable AG1c–H2O structure, the water molecule is bound as a proton acceptor to the p-OH catechol group, in a similar way as the most stable NA–H2O structure observed and predicted by theory.2
Background	Naturally, under physiological conditions, adrenaline will not adopt its gas-phase geometry.
Background	Further details on the potential model are provided in ref. 25.
Background	MP2 in principle allows the calculation of dispersion-type interactions; however, MP2 calculations with large basis sets readily become intractable for the size of systems studied in this work.
Observation	Their structures, located with B3LYP/6-31+G*, are shown in Fig. 7.
Conclusion	This is in agreement with the larger polarity of OH as compared to NH, as well as with studies on the hydrogen-bonding abilities of oxygen and nitrogen in different hydrogen-bonding environments (oxygens covalently bound to two non-hydrogen atoms of which at least one is sp2 hybridised30 and hydrogen bonds to monocyclic aromatic heterocycles31), which showed that nitrogen atoms are stronger hydrogen-bond acceptors than oxygens.
Result	The calculations predict the extended AG1a and folded GG1a adrenaline conformers to be nearly isoenergetic.
Background	However, if one wants to compute relative interaction energies of A–H2O complexes consisting of different A conformers, then one should use the equilibrium energy of the most stable conformer.
Background	As the MP2fit/DMA potential is a rigid-body potential, the DMA for adrenaline needs to be recomputed for each different conformer.
Observation	This is demonstrated more effectively in Figs. 4 and 5, which show the relative energies Δ(E0) of the A and PA conformers grouped together in their conformational families.
Method	The model potential calculations were done with the program Orient.24
Observation	Structure 12 is a mixed insertion/addition structure: the first water molecule is inserted between the chain O and the NH group, whereas the second water molecule is added to the nitrogen.
Conclusion	This is confirmed by the good agreement between the MP2fit/DMA and MP2/DZPi results for the π-bonded structures.
Result	The specific water interaction energy (32 kJ mol−1) shows that this is the most favourable water-binding site.
Background	Similarly, the most intense band in the UV spectrum of APE was assigned to the extended AG conformer, even though MP2 calculations predicted the GG structure to be slightly more stable.10
Background	Even though environmental effects play an important role in modelling biological processes, an understanding of the intrinsic energetics of flexible biomolecules is essential for disentangling the relative importance of the intrinsic and environmental effects.
Result	One of the catechol OH groups is hydrogen bonded to its neighbour, resulting in a red-shifted stretch mode.
Model	Thus, the B3LYP/6-31+G* interaction energy of a particular AG1a–H2O hydrate will be the same as its specific water interaction energy, but the corresponding MP2/DZPi interaction energy will contain an energy penalty term reflecting the difference in stability of the AG1a and GG1a conformers.
Model	Structures in which a water molecule was too far from the adrenaline molecule (closest intermolecular contact larger than 4 Å) were discarded as well.
Model	The optimisations were converged using Gaussian's “tight” criteria for the cutoffs on forces and step size.
Background	This makes the N atom chiral as well, which leads to the existence of two diastereoisomers: adrenaline (1R2S/1S2R) and pseudoadrenaline (1S2S/1R2R).
Object	In this study, we have investigated the conformational structures of adrenaline (A) and pseudoadrenaline (PA) at the MP2 and DFT levels of theory.
Result	In the current study we find that this addition structure is also the most stable 1∶1 hydrate of the AG1c adrenaline conformer (see Table 2 and Fig. 7): in this structure (labelled catOH–Ow), the water binds to one of the catechol OH groups to form an OH⋯OH⋯OwHw daisy chain of hydrogen bonds.
Background	A recent computational study provided a prediction for the structure and function of G protein-coupled receptors, including the β1-adrenergic receptor.47
Observation	The remaining five structures are double addition structures, formed by the addition of the two water molecules to two different functional groups of adrenaline: In structures 7 and 10 one water molecule binds to the nitrogen, while the other binds to the chain oxygen, whereas in structures 8 and 9 the second water binds to one of the catechol hydroxyl groups.
Object	We have explored the molecular structures of the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of the AG3b adrenaline conformer.
Object	We first explored the conformational landscapes of adrenaline and pseudoadrenaline holding the catechol OH groups in the Cδ-trans orientation.
Observation	Also shown in Fig. 8 is the counterpoise-corrected potential energy profile.
Method	The electronic-structure calculations were performed with Gaussian 98 (revisions A.9 and A.11)19 and NWChem (version 4.1)20 on clusters of 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 and 2.0 GHz dual Xeon PCs running Linux.
Model	Gaussian's “ultrafine” integration grid was used for the DFT calculations.
Background	This delocalised zero-point motion indicates that even at 0 K these minima cannot be differentiated experimentally.
Method	The geometries of the resulting 33 540 geometries were optimised with the MP2fit/DMA model potential.
Model	This is notated by “a” (Cδ-syn, above plane), “b” (Cδ-trans, above plane), “c” (Cδ-trans, below plane) and “d” (Cδ-syn, below plane).
Background	This is a formidable task, and would best be done in combination with an experimental study, which can provide guidance to the type of hydrates observed experimentally.
Background	However, whereas both AG1 and GG1 APE conformers were observed experimentally, the NA experiments, surprisingly showed only one NA conformer, which was assigned as AG1a.1
Model	We have reoptimised the structures of these twelve hydrates, and of two lower-lying hydrates (23 and 28), with B3LYP/6-31+G*.
Result	Structures 1, 4 and 11 are bridge structures: the two water molecules bridge the adrenaline chain oxygen and nitrogen functional groups.
Background	Frequencies of the other conformers are available upon request.
Background	Indeed, plots of the H-density derived from diffusion Monte Carlo studies on hydrogen-bonded complexes like uracil–(H2O)n (n = 1–3)21 and cytosine–(H2O)238 show a large-amplitude, banana-shaped, zero-point vibrational motion of the free water hydrogen atoms, covering the corresponding minima differing only in the position of the free water hydrogen (above or below the plane of the biomolecule).
Method	An Origin 2000 and a cluster of Sun 900 MHz V880 servers at the HiPerSPACE Computing Centre at University College London were used as well.
Result	Unfortunately, also the frequency of the hydrogen-bonded side-chain OH stretch mode, OH–N, is very similar in AG1a and GG1a, though the AG1a mode has a larger intensity.
Observation	In A and PA the “a” conformers, which have a Cδ-syn orientation of the catecholic hydroxyls, appear to be favoured.
Result	B3LYP underestimates the relative stability of the GG1 conformers, which contain a short N–H⋯π (A) or CH⋯π (PA) contact, of the GG2 conformers, which also contain a short N–H⋯π (PA) or CH⋯π (A) contact, and of the GA conformers, which contain a short NH⋯π interaction.
Background	To understand the effect of water on the geometry of the biomolecule, one has to study clusters containing numerous water molecules.
Method	The interaction energies were corrected for BSSE (basis set superposition error) by using the counterpoise procedure.12
Result	AW2-8 and AW2-9 converge to the same minimum when reoptimised with B3LYP.
Result	The PA OH–N mode, on the other hand, is sufficiently different in AG1a and GG1a to aid assignment of future observed conformers.
Conclusion	The catOH–Ow hydrates of AG1a and GG1a, the two most stable adrenaline conformers, are the most likely candidates for experimental observation, since the catOH–Ow hydrate was found to be the observed NA–H2O structure.2
Observation	Table 4 lists the calculated infrared frequencies of these two structures.
Observation	Fig. 7 shows that the re-optimisation significantly increases the MP2 hydrogen-bond distances.
Object	We investigate the different water-binding sites, and we comment on the most appropriate theoretical methodology to compute the relative stability of hydrates containing different adrenaline conformers.
Method	The DMA was derived from the wavefunctions calculated with Gaussian 98 by using the GDMA23 program.
Background	(However, Vargas et al. found that NH⋯O interactions are more stable than NH⋯N interactions,33 which is in contradiction with the presumed larger hydrogen-bond acceptor ability of N as compared to O).
Result	The model potential generally yields interaction energies that are 2–4 kJ mol−1 larger than the corresponding B3LYP values, except for the π-bonded structures and the AG3c N–HwOw minimum, for which the model potential yields much larger interaction energies.
Conclusion	The current study shows the limitations of using a rigid-body potential for calculating the adrenaline hydrates.
Model	The relative energies of the resulting nineteen A and twenty PA conformers were evaluated by single-point MP2/6-31+G* and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations.
Background	The results are very encouraging.
Result	The N⋯HOw interaction in the AG1c NH–Ow hydrate, on the other hand, is replaced by a stronger N⋯HwOw hydrogen bond in AG3b–H2O.
Observation	Table 3 shows the computed interaction energies of the 1∶1 AG3b–H2O hydrates.
Background	The catechol OH groups have two possible orientations forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond: Cδ-syn (the catechol hydrogens are syn with respect to the Cδ–H group) and Cδ-trans (the catechol hydrogens are trans with respect to the Cδ–H group).
Model	(The AG2/3 and GG2/3 families differ depending on which amino H atom is involved in the H-bonding).
Conclusion	Thus, it is more likely that MP2fit/DMA overestimates the interaction energies, even though the potential did not overestimate uracil-(H2O)2 interaction energies.46
Background	However, there are several major problems with geometry optimisations of molecular clusters consisting of more than two constituents.
Result	All minima are found (we failed to locate one of the two O–HwOw AG1c hydrates, but as mentioned above, structures that only differ in the free Hw orientation are basically the same structure).
Observation	In structure 23 the two waters form a ring structure involving one of the catechol hydroxyls.
Background	The discrepancy for the N-HwOw structure indicates a possible deficiency in the potential's parameters for N. The repulsion and dispersion parameters of O and H were adjusted to yield good agreement with MP2 data on the minima and transition states of uracil-water,25 but the N parameters were not attuned to ab initio data (they were derived from empirical fits to organic crystal structures and heats of sublimation41–43), and thus, the N parameters may not be optimal for reproducing the gas-phase structures.
Model	To correct for this in an approximate way, the hydrogen-bond distances in these complexes were corrected for BSSE by numerically locating the distance for which the counterpoise-corrected De has its maximum.1,15,17,18
Background	The study of the hydrates of flexible biomolecules remains a difficult and computationally expensive task.
Background	The water molecule can further bind to the side-chain NH group (NH–Ow), to either of the lone pairs of the side-chain oxygen (the two O–HwOw structures), and to the π-electron cloud of the catechol ring.
Result	For the GG2 family both A and PA are destabilised with respect to the corresponding NA conformers, as the NH⋯π interaction is replaced by a CH⋯π contact in A, while in PA the NH⋯O interaction is replaced by a CH⋯O contact.
Observation	In this structure, the two waters bridge the chain OH and NH functional groups.
Model	In A and PA, the corresponding AG2/3 and GG2/3 families will have an NH⋯O (if the free hydrogen in the corresponding NA structure is methylated) or a CH⋯O contact (if the hydrogen-bonding H atom is methylated).
Background	In our previous study on noradrenaline we found that the twenty most stable NA conformers are of the AG or GG types (AG1, GG1, AG2, AG3 and GG2).1
Background	The study shows the two catechol OH groups forming hydrogen bonds with serine residues, whereas the chain hydroxyl and the amino group form hydrogen bonds with an aspartic acid, in good agreement with earlier mutation experiments.48–51
Background	All individual terms of this potential are pairwise additive, and thus, it can readily be extended to complexes containing more than two molecules.
Observation	One of the A Cδ-syn conformers (AG3a-2) appeared to be unstable.
Model	In the current paper, the interaction energies are listed as De (=−ΔE) and D0 (=−ΔE0), so that positive values denote an attractive interaction.
Observation	Comparison of the frequencies of the bare molecule (Table 1) with those of the hydrates (Table 4) reveals a strong red shift of the (OH)cat frequency, accompanied by a large increase in intensity.
Observation	The conformers with an intramolecular OH⋯N hydrogen bond (AG1, GG1) are more stable than the NH⋯O hydrogen-bonded structures (AG2, AG3, GG2).
Observation	Fig. 6 compares the relative energies Δ(E0) of the corresponding NA, A and PA conformers obtained from single-point MP2 calculations.
Result	The most stable adrenaline/pseudoadrenaline conformers, in the gas phase, are those forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds: both the extended AG1 and the folded GG1 conformers contain an intramolecular OH⋯N hydrogen bond.
Observation	Predictions for the infrared spectra of the AG1a and GG1a conformers and their 1∶1 hydrates are presented.
Background	Firstly, the number of local minima increases steeply with the number of constituents in the cluster, and secondly, the convergence of the calculations slows down due to the coupling of inter- and intramolecular degrees of freedom.39
Conclusion	Based on the relative energies of the different conformers, we conclude that the extended AG1a and folded GG1a conformers are the most likely candidates for detection in spectroscopy experiments using a supersonic expansion.
Background	Our initial investigation of the adrenaline hydrates in this paper provides a first step in studying the environmental effects on the structure of adrenaline.
Background	As the model potential proved unsuitable to locate the A–(H2O)2 structures, further investigation of this problem has not been pursued.
Method	The conformational landscapes of adrenaline and pseudoadrenaline have been explored by electronic structure computation at the B3LYP/6-31+G*, MP2/6-31+G* and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory.
Object	In this study we have studied the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of the AG3b conformer.
Background	Adrenaline/pseudoadrenaline is formed by the replacement of one of the hydrogens of the terminal NH2 group by a methyl group.
Motivation	To find the most stable hydrates, one should not only investigate clusters involving the most stable conformer, but one has to consider several of the low-lying conformers, as the interaction with water may change the relative stability of the conformers.
Background	Previous work in this series include the investigation of the conformational landscapes of noradrenaline (NA),1 the simplest catecholamine neurotransmitter, and of singly hydrated NA.2
Method	The monomer geometries used were obtained by geometry optimisations at the same level of theory as used to calculate the DMAs.
Object	The shape of neurotransmitters in the gas phase: A theoretical study of adrenaline, pseudoadrenaline, and hydrated adrenaline
Result	The counterpoise-corrected barrier, though larger than the uncorrected barrier, is still only 0.8 kJ mol−1.
Background	However, the most stable 1∶1 hydrate of NA (which has a catechol ring instead of the benzene ring in 2-phenoxy- ethanol, APE and the ephedra), was found to be an addition structure; the water molecule binds to one of the catechol OH groups,2 indicating that the hydroxyl groups of the catechol ring provide a more attractive water-binding site than the ethanolamine side chain.
Object	In this article we provide a full theoretical characterisation of the neutral conformers of adrenaline and pseudoadrenaline in the gas phase, and provide a first investigation of the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of adrenaline.
Model	The resulting conformations were subjected to HF/6-31G* geometry optimisations.
Observation	The relative energies Δ(Ee) and Δ(E0) of the resulting 28 PA conformers, in decreasing order of stability based on the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ Δ(Ee) values, are listed in Table S2 of the ESI.
Background	In pseudoephedrine, for example, hydration results in a substantial rearrangement of its conformational landscape, altering the conformation at the global minimum from an extended (Aga) to a folded (Gga) conformation.3
Result	In all these, the adrenaline chain oxygen acts as a hydrogen-bond acceptor.
Result	As can be seen, B3LYP/6-31+G* favours the AG1a hydrate, whereas MP2/DZPi favours the GG1a hydrate.
Object	We have also calculated the relative energies of the AG3 and GG2 families, which were not among the twenty most stable PA conformers.
Background	Because the MP2fit/DMA is a rigid-body potential, the adrenaline molecule cannot adjust its geometry to facilitate the water molecule to migrate between two of its functional groups.
Object	In this section, we explore the suitability of force-field calculations using the MP2fit/DMA21 rigid-body model potential for scanning the potential energy surface of the hydrates.
Background	As the three-body contribution is about 25% for uracil-(H2O)2, this indicates that the model potential's repulsion and dispersion parameters, which have been determined by empirical parameterisation, must have absorbed some of the water-water non-additivity.44
Observation	At the B3LYP level of theory, PA is slightly more stable than A; this order is reversed however at the MP2 level of theory.
Object	We will first investigate the performance of the model potential for locating the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and AG3b conformers.
Object	We have computed ten different AG1c–H2O and ten different AG3b–H2O structures.
Background	(Infrared frequencies of the other hydrates are available upon request).
Background	In the first π-bonded structure, OH–OwHw–π, the water forms an additional hydrogen bond with this OH group.
Observation	To aid future spectroscopic assignment, we have listed the harmonic frequencies of the hydride stretches of the AG1a and GG1a conformers, calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory, in Table 1.
Result	This re-optimisation has negligible effect on the B3LYP results, but it significantly increases the MP2/DZPi interaction energy, thereby further increasing the discrepancy between the MP2 and DFT results.
Method	Unless specified otherwise, we will use the second definition in the current paper.
Background	It has been proposed that the water surrounding the neurotransmitter and its receptor invokes the initial recognition process, possibly by a change in the receptor geometry induced by the structure-breaking effects of the catechol ring.53
Observation	Their structures, located with B3LYP/6-31+G*, are displayed in Fig. 9.
Observation	The adrenaline AG2 conformers are much less stable than the corresponding NA and PA conformers.
Observation	We found as many as 170 different minima; however, some of these are very similar in structure.
Result	The pseudoadrenaline AG1a conformer on the other hand is more stable than GG1a by 3 kJ mol−1.
Model	The A–H2O and PA–H2O structures considered in this work were optimised with B3LYP/6-31+G*.
Result	Similarly, the pseudoadrenaline AG3 conformers are destabilised by the replacement of an intramolecular NH⋯O by a less favourable CH⋯O interaction.
Background	If one is interested in how strongly water binds to a particular conformer, then the equilibrium geometry of this particular conformer should be used.
Background	There is, in fact, a third orientation for the catechol OH groups.
Model	These are computed as the difference of the energy of A/PA (or H2O) at the geometry the monomer adopts in the complex, and the energy of the free molecule at its equilibrium geometry re.
Background	The potential has different parameters for each atom type (C, N, O, H), and it distinguishes between hydrogens attached to C, polar hydrogens (attached to O or N), and water hydrogens.
Conclusion	Though it is possible that DFT underestimates the AG3b–(H2O)2 interaction energies, it is unlikely that they are underestimated by as much as 20 kJ mol−1.
Result	While the model potential did find all relevant 1∶1 hydrates, including the insertion-type structures, it failed to locate the most stable 1∶2 hydrate, characterised by a large internal rotation around the Cβ–O bond.
Model	To provide the interaction energies at 0 K, ΔE0, the (harmonic, scaled by 0.976) zero-point energies (ZPE) of AW and the separated fragments (computed in the harmonic approximation) were taken into account: ΔE0 = ΔE + EZPEAW − EZPEA(global)(re) − EZPEW(re)(For the specific water interaction energy , one should take the zero-point energy of adrenaline at the equilibrium geometry of the particular conformer one is interested in, instead of that of the global minimum).
Background	Relative energies calculated like this are corrected for BSSE, in contrast to relative energies based on the A–H2O total energies.
Result	The two insertion structures have large monomer deformation energies, reflecting the energy penalty associated with opening up the dihedral angle between the two functional groups, to make space for the water molecule.
Model	For γ1, γ2 and γ3 we initially used torsion angle step sizes of 60°.
Background	Its shape and conformation result from a delicate balance of intramolecular and environmental influences.
Conclusion	Despite this large conformational distortion of adrenaline, costing 10 kJ mol−1, the AW2-global structure is the most stable AG3b–(H2O)2 hydrate located in this study.
Observation	Fig. 10 lists the twelve most stable structures found with MP2fit/DMA, in decreasing order of stability.
Observation	The twenty most stable A conformers (based on the B3LYP energies) include the equivalents of the AG1, GG1 and AG3 conformers found for NA, a second AG3 family and a GA family.
Object	The current work focuses on the adrenaline (A)/pseudoadrenaline (PA) pair.
Background	For a complete study of adrenaline hydration, one would have to include several of the low-lying conformers, as the interaction with water may change their relative stability, and one would have to look at larger clusters (containing more water molecules) as well.
Conclusion	This structure is characterised by a large conformational distortion of the adrenaline moiety, which cannot be described by the rigid-body model potential.
Background	The global minimum is an insertion structure for 1∶1 clusters of 2-aminoethanol with phenol,36 and for the 1∶1 hydrates of 2-phenoxy-ethanol,37 APE,30 and the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine pair.3
Result	Structure 23 obeys the basic structural principle of XW2 clusters in which X corresponds to an aromatic alcohol (catechol, in this case), which are equivalent to a water trimer in which one of the free hydrogens is replaced by the aromatic ring.39
Object	In this paper, we present the initial investigation of the 1∶1 and 1∶2 adrenaline hydrates.
Background	AG1c belongs to the most stable conformer family, AG1, whereas AG3b belongs to the first family of conformers with an intramolecular NH⋯O hydrogen bond.
Background	To classify the A and PA conformers we used the same notation as employed in our previous study on NA,1 which is based on previous studies on 2-amino-1-phenylethanol10,26 and the ephedra:27–29
Conclusion	The discrepancy between the DFT and MP2fit/DMA results for the π-bonded structures is due to the inability of DFT to properly describe these structures, rather than deficiencies in the model potential.
Model	(ii) In NA, which contains an NH2 group instead of the NH(CH3) group in A and PA, the AG and GG conformers have either a short OH⋯N (AG1, GG1), or a short NH⋯O (AG2/3, GG2/3) contact.
Background	The semi-empirical AM1 and PM3 methods are not suitable for this, as these methods failed to accurately predict the structure and relative stabilities of the different serotonin conformers.40
Background	The effect of BSSE on the intermolecular geometry can be quite large15,18 when using the DZPi basis set.
Observation	The relative energies of the resulting 27 A conformers, listed in decreasing order of stability based on the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ energies, are collected in Table S1 of the ESI.
Background	In this one the catechol hydrogens point away from each other, preventing the catechol OH groups to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.
Model	We have calculated the HF/6-31G* relaxed potential energy profile for the umbrella inversion starting from the AG1a conformer, and optimised the geometry of the transition state for this process (see Fig. 3).
Object	As the effect of BSSE on the intermolecular geometry can be quite large in π-bonded complexes,15,18 we re-optimised the hydrogen-bond distances of the two π-bonded structures with counterpoise corrections.
Background	A biomolecule's molecular shape plays a crucial role in its transport properties, its selectivity and function, and its receptor binding properties.
Model	Zero-point energies (scaled by 097610). and scaled (097610. for OH, 095611. for NH) harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory.
Background	This paper is part of a combined theoretical/experimental study of the catecholamine neurotransmitters.
Background	It is however much less favourable than the orientations forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond.
Observation	Unexpectedly, the effect is of similar magnitude for the π-bonded and conventional hydrogen-bonded structures.
Observation	Two other structures (5 and 7) are not stable on the B3LYP potential energy surface.
Goal	To investigate the barrier for interconversion between the (a) and (b) structure, we have calculated the relaxed potential energy profile for rotation of the free water hydrogen around the Ocat–Ow axis.
Observation	In Table 5 we have listed the specific interaction energies, and De, for the catOH–Ow hydrates of AG1a and GG1a.
Background	It consists of an atom–atom 6–exp potential to describe the repulsion and dispersion terms, and a DMA (distributed multipole analysis) model for the electrostatic contribution.
Observation	Table 2 shows the computed interaction energies of the AG1c–H2O hydrates.
Result	A similar effect was observed for protonated nicotine-(H2O)2,22 Also for this system, the interaction with water induces a large conformational distortion, costing 12 kJ mol−1, which allows the two water molecules to bridge the pyridine and pyrrolidinium rings.
Result	Thus, the insertion structure in which the water molecule is located between the side-chain OH and NH2 functional groups contains an OH⋯OwHw⋯N hydrogen-bond chain in AG1c–H2O, but an O⋯HwOw⋯NH hydrogen-bond chain in AG3b–H2O resulting in a 5 kJ mol−1 weaker interaction.
Object	We have therefore computed the structures and geometries of the π-bonded complexes with MP2/DZPi.
Observation	The narrow energy gap between the adrenaline AG1 and GG1 conformers was also observed for NA1 and APE (2-amino-1-phenylethanol),10 the benzene analogue of NA.
Background	The model potential used, dubbed MP2fit/DMA, was developed in a study on uracil-water,21 and used recently in an investigation of protonated nicotine interacting with water and a third body.22
Result	Despite this energy penalty, the OH–OwHw–N insertion structure is only slightly less stable than the global minimum (catOH–Ow).
Method	We explored the suitability of a rigid-body DMA-based model potential to locate the most stable 1∶1 and 1∶2 adrenaline-water clusters.
Observation	Table 6 compares the MP2fit/DMA and B3LYP specific water interaction energies.
Observation	Table 2 shows that the O–HwOw–π structure is not stable on the B3LYP/6-31+G* potential energy surface.
Background	Finally, we would like to comment on the calculation of the interaction energies.
Observation	The different dimer addition structures just differ in the position of the free water hydrogens, or in the direction of the hydrogen-bond chain itself.
Observation	The resulting interaction energies are included in Tables 2 and 3.
Goal	In addition, we explore the suitability of force-field calculations using a DMA (distributed multipole analysis)-based rigid-body model potential for scanning the potential energy surface of the hydrates.
Background	There are two different insertion-type structures, with water being located either between the chain OH and NH2 groups (OH–OwHw–N) or between the two catechol OH groups (catOH–OwHw–catO).
Model	The model potential yields the interaction between two rigid monomer fragments, and thus, the MP2fit/DMA results should be compared to the B3LYP and MP2 specific water interaction energies.
Hypothesis	Even though A and PA are roughly isoenergetic, it is not likely that there will be interconversion between the two diastereoisomers in supersonic expansion experiments, as interconversion via umbrella-inversion of the chiral amino group is expected to have a high barrier.
Conclusion	Hydration is believed to play an important role in the drug-receptor recognition process.
Model	For B3LYP/6-31+G* and single-point MP2 calculations with the 6-31+G* or aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets this is the AG1a conformer, but for MP2/DZPi this is the GG1a conformer.
Conclusion	This is because the A conformer has a CH⋯O instead of an NH⋯O interaction.
Model	To provide starting structures for geometry optimisations, the γ1 = γ(Cδ–Cγ–Cβ–Cα), γ2 = γ(Cγ–Cβ–Cα–N), γ3 = γ(Cβ–Cα–N–C) torsion angles were initially set to 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300°, and γ4 = γ(Cγ–Cβ–O–H) was set to 60°, 180° and 300°.
Background	In addition, the number of local minima increases steeply with the number of constituents in the cluster.
Conclusion	Thus, for conformers that contain π-type interactions, B3LYP is less reliable for calculating relative energies.
Background	The interaction energies of π-type hydrogen bonds are difficult to evaluate accurately, due to the large contribution of the dispersion energy to the interaction, which is known to converge slowly with addition of high angular momentum polarisation functions.13
Motivation	The study of gas-phase biomolecules is essential in order to differentiate the relative importance of the intrinsic and environmental influences on the biomolecule's conformation.
Background	However, because AG3b has an NH⋯O hydrogen bond instead of the OH⋯N bond in AG1c, hydrates in which water binds to the side chain can be radically different.
Observation	However, the model potential fails to locate the most stable AG3b–(H2O)2 structure located with B3LYP.
Object	In this section, we investigate the model potential suitability for A–(H2O)2 clusters.
Background	The study predicts that the catechol hydrogens point away from each other, an unfavourable orientation not considered in the current work.
Conclusion	This shows the limitation of rigid-body calculations in studies of biomolecular clusters.
Background	Previous studies on the hydration of ethanolamine neurotransmitters and their analogues found two different categories of 1∶1 hydrates: insertion structures, in which the water inserts between two functional groups of the host molecule, and addition structures, formed by the addition of a water molecule to one of the functional groups.
Model	The DMA electrostatic model of this potential accurately describes non-spherical features of the charge distribution, such as π-electron clouds and lone pairs, which play an important role in establishing the water-binding sites in the biomolecule.
Observation	Structure 11 has a different hydrogen-bonding pattern than 1 and 4 (O⋯HO⋯HOH⋯N instead of O⋯HOH⋯OH⋯N).
Motivation	Thus, to find all possible minima for the A–(H2O)n clusters of several low-lying adrenaline conformers using methods like DFT or MP2 becomes a near-impossible task.
Observation	In structures 2, 3, 5 and 6 the water molecules form a dimer structure, which is bonded to the adrenaline nitrogen.
Observation	The NH stretch modes have near-zero intensity, and cannot be expected to be observed experimentally.
Background	We call these dimer addition structures.
Result	The twenty most stable PA conformers (based on the B3LYP energies) include the equivalent conformers of the AG1, GG1 and AG2 conformers found for NA, as well as a GA and GG3 family, which were not among the most stable NA conformers.
Background	Consequently, a full study of the adrenaline hydrates will be a formidable task.
Background	This orientation was also identified as a local minimum on the potential energy surface of catechol,4–6 and caffeic acid (which consists of a catechol moiety and a propenoate side chain).7
Observation	A related structure (catO–HwOw) with a similar hydrogen-bond chain but with water acting as the hydrogen bond donor is distinctly less stable.
Method	One geometry optimisation took approximately 1 minute of CPU time on a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 PC.
Observation	Structures 1 and 4 are very similar, with just small differences in the position of the free water hydrogens.
Background	We have therefore not considered this particular orientation of the catechol OH groups.
Hypothesis	It is likely that also for adrenaline the AG1a conformer will be the preferred structure.
Observation	Fig. 7 shows two nearly iso-energetic catO–HwOw structures, just differing in the position of the free (not hydrogen-bonded) water hydrogen, which can be on either side of the aromatic ring.
Conclusion	To aid future spectroscopic assignment, we have provided infrared frequencies of the OH and NH stretch modes of the two most stable adrenaline conformers, AG1a and GG1a, and their most plausible singly hydrated clusters.
Model	As the eclipsed conformations were found not to be local minima on the potential energy surface, part of the conformational search considered only staggered conformations.
Model	(iii) The catechol OH groups can have two different orientations (Cδ-syn and Cδ-trans) and the side chain can be above or below the ring.
Conclusion	As studies on conformational relaxation in supersonic jets indicate that barriers larger than 6 kJ mol−1 are sufficient to prevent conformational relaxation,34,35 it is very unlikely that A ↔ PA interconversion will take place at the low temperatures of supersonic jet experiments.
Background	In the second π-bonded structure, OwHw–π, the water binds to the other face to the catechol ring, where there is no possibility to form an additional strong hydrogen-bonded contact (although there is some additional stabilisation due to the two CH⋯Ow interactions), and this structure is therefore less stable than the OH–OwHw–π minimum.
Method	As usual, only the valence electrons were correlated.
Conclusion	In general, B3LYP gives smaller AG3b–(H2O)2 interaction energies than MP2fit/DMA.
Model	Structures in which one of the moieties overlapped with another one (as indicated by an intermolecular distance smaller than 1.2 Å) were discarded.
Model	The Cδ-syn conformers of the ten most stable A and of the ten most stable PA conformers were located using B3LYP/6-31+G*.
Observation	The adrenaline chain oxygen acts as a proton donor (in contrast to the other bridge structures, 1, 4 and 11, in which the oxygen acts as an acceptor).
Observation	There are significant differences between the B3LYP and MP2 relative energies of A and PA.
Background	The structure of adrenaline in blood will be affected by environmental factors such as protonation, solvation and interaction with other molecules present, whereas the structure of the neurotransmitter in its receptor binding site will be influenced by competing hydrogen-bonding interactions with binding-site residues.
Background	However, as for NA, this issue cannot be resolved without spectroscopic investigation.
Background	Thus, environmental factors appear to have a profound effect on the structure of the neurotransmitter.
Model	We created AG3b–(H2O)2 starting structures by systematically varying the position of the two water molecules in steps of 2 Å, in three orthogonal directions.
Method	An earlier study on indole-H2O and methylindole-H2O15 showed that MP2 calculations employing the compact interaction-optimised DZPi basis set16,17 do give accurate interaction energies, for conventional and π-type H-bonded complexes.
Motivation	As different levels of theory yield different results on the relative stability of AG1a and GG1a, assignment of AG1a or GG1a as the global minimum cannot be based on the calculated energy differences alone.
Method	The deformation energies were taken into account as well.
Observation	The structures of the sixteen most stable A and PA conformers (based on the single-point MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ energies) are shown in Fig. 2.
Method	(In the NA experiments, gas-phase NA was generated via laser ablation rather than evaporation using a heated nozzle, which may influence the observed conformer distribution).
Background	Calculations show that this catechol group orientation is about 19 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than corresponding conformers in which the catechol OH groups form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.4,52
Model	The geometries of all conformers with energies less than 20 kJ mol−1 above the global minimum were re-optimised with density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP8,9 functional and the 6-31+G* basis set.
Background	For the most stable NA conformer (AG1a), we located as many as eleven different AG1a–H2O structures.2
Model	For completeness, we have also optimised the structures of the AG2 and GG2 adrenaline conformers with B3LYP/6-31+G* (followed by single-point MP2/6-31+G* and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations).
Background	The resulting interaction energy is called the specific water interaction energy (ΔEH2O).
Result	Although B3LYP predicts the adrenaline GG1a conformer to be less stable than AG1a by 2.4 kJ mol−1 (3.0 kJ mol−1 after zero-point vibrational corrections), at the single-point MP2/aug- cc-pVDZ level of theory this energy gap has decreased to a mere 0.49 kJ mol−1 (1.06 kJ mol−1 after vibrational corrections).
Background	Noradrenaline has one chiral centre (the Cβ atom, see Fig. 1 for the labelling of the atoms), and thus occurs in two spectroscopically identical chiral forms (R and S).
Observation	As can be seen in Fig. 8, the catO–HwOw (a) minimum is very shallow, with an almost non-existent barrier for conversion to the (b) structure, and it is therefore surprising that the (a) structure was found at all!
Result	This internal rotation is not possible with the rigid-body MP2fit/DMA potential.
Result	To allow this particular water-binding arrangement, the OH group has to rotate by as much as 60° around the Cβ–O bond, changing the hydroxyl hydrogen from a staggered to an eclipsed position with respect to the Cβ hydrogen.
Result	The N–HwOw AG3b–H2O structure is of comparable stability to the most stable AG1c–H2O structure (catOH–Ow), despite the 2.5 kJ mol−1 smaller stability of the AG3b conformer.
Observation	Most worryingly though, we have found an additional structure with B3LYP (labelled AW2-global, see Fig. 10).
Background	Rablen et al. likewise found that nitrogens are better hydrogen-bond acceptors than sp3-hybridised oxygens.32
Result	The barrier height for this process is calculated to be 26.6 kJ mol−1.
Result	Both insertion structures (OH–OwHw–N/O–HwOw–HN and catOH–OwHw–catO) were found with the model potential calculations, demonstrating that the rigidity of the model potential does not prevent these structures to be found.
Observation	Structure 28 contains a water dimer bridging the chain OH and π-electron binding sites.
Background	Current standard density functionals cannot evaluate the dispersion energy quantitatively.14
Background	As explained in the Methodology section, the interaction energies should be computed relative to the most stable conformer, more precisely, the most stable conformer for the method and basis set used.
Observation	Good agreement with the DFT results was obtained only when the distorted nicotine geometry (and its corresponding DMA) was used in the MP2fit/DMA model potential calculations.22
Background	The AG3b hydrates in which water binds to the catechol OH groups are very similar in structure and interaction energy to their corresponding AG1c hydrates.
Model	Two different rotational orientations of the water molecules were considered.
Result	This is due to hydrogen bonding with the water molecule, as was also observed for NA–H2O.2
Background	Zwier suggested that such water bridges may be a preferred structural motif in cases where it can be formed.45
Model	Cδ-syn and Cδ-trans conformations corresponding to the same side chain conformation differ slightly in energy due to interaction of the catechol hydroxyl groups with the side chain functional groups.
Model	(i) The A/G notation denotes the arrangements (anti or gauche) of the Cγ–Cβ–Cα–N and O–Cβ–Cα–N atom chains, respectively.
Result	The model potential was able to locate all relevant 1∶1 clusters, but failed to find the most stable 1∶2 cluster.
Observation	Most B3LYP-optimised structures are very similar to their corresponding MP2fit/DMA structures, but there are some important differences.
Result	The “free” catechol OH stretch band, (OH)free, cat, and the stretch band of the hydrogen-bonded catechol OH, (OH–O)cat, occur at nearly identical frequencies/intensities in AG1a and GG1a, and therefore cannot be used to distinguish between the two conformers.
Background	Of particular interest are the insertion-type structures.
Hypothesis	It can therefore be expected that the two minima will be indistinguishable even at the very low vibrational temperatures of supersonic jet experiments.

Method	This constitutes an important precondition for its application to flame structure studies, simulating concentration profiles of major species and key intermediates in fuel rich acetylene and propene flames in good agreement with the experiments.
Conclusion	The overall rate coefficients lie within the error range of the reported values.10,20
Result	Compared with the case of acetylene this leads to a more complex mass flow to benzene with a higher number of reaction steps involved.
Result	A very good match between the predicted and the experimental concentrations is found for the major species H2, H2O, CO, CO2 and is displayed in Fig. 11.
Result	Here the concentration of A1 at the peak was reduced only by 30% when propargyl combination with k383 = 1 × 1011 cm3 mol−1 s−1 is omitted (rate coefficient for 20 torr in Wang and Frenklach’s model).
Result	Here reaction (R449) is still among the most sensitive reactions.
Result	A reaction sensitivity analysis (Fig. 9) at the position of the maximum concentration of benzene shows that the most sensitive reactions are the propargyl combination and radical/atom + fuel reactions on the path to C3H3.
Motivation	Benzene is commonly accepted to be a key species in PAH formation while the pathways to benzene are still discussed.
Result	The flow diagram for the acetylene/propene flame (Fig. 20) is very similar to the propene flow diagram.
Result	This is due to the the high contribution of C2H2 reactions with methylene to benzene formation.
Model	The key change of the Warnatz C1–C2-chemistry is the replacement of the kinetic data for the reaction 3CH2 + O2 by the values reported by Dembrowsky and Wagner.19
Model	In order to predict simultaneously flame velocities, ignition delay times and species concentration profiles for various fuels and flame stoichiometries an unspecific, broadly validated C1–C4-chemistry is appropriate.
Result	(see Table 2).
Background	In 1987 Frenklach and Warnatz presented a kinetic model predicting PAH (poly-aromatic hydrocarbon) concentration profiles in sooting acetylene flames.6
Method	Simulations were also performed with reaction (R*) added to the mechanism:13C3H3 + C3H5 → A1 + H + HThough benzene concentrations in the propene flame could be predicted well even when reactions for C6H8 build up, reaction (R384)–(R394), were omitted, there arise several drawbacks.
Result	Reaction (R391R) in particular is a source of early formed propargyl and accounts for the high benzene concentrations compared to the acetylene flame.
Observation	Fig. 19 shows the results of the reaction sensitivity analysis at the maximum concentration of benzene.
Conclusion	The calculated absolute flame velocities of laminar premixed flames (CH4-, C2H6-, C3H8-, n-C4H10-, C2H4-, C3H6-, and C2H2-air) and the dependence on mixture strength agree with the latest experimental investigations reported in the literature.
Motivation	Soot emissions of combustion engines are suspected to cause cancer and research on soot formation is in the focus of both science and industry.
Object	The importance of the reactions of C2H2 with CH2 for predicting benzene concentration profiles of all flames was discussed above.
Background	Ten years later Wang and Frenklach published a GRI based detailed reaction mechanism describing fuel oxidation, benzene formation and PAH mass growth7 being the most extensive study on soot formation in C2-flames.
Object	The C3-chemistry is a new compilation.
Result	But the computed A1 concentration profiles reach just 20% of the experimental value when reaction (R383) is neglected in the kinetic scheme.
Conclusion	The mechanism presented here is capable to predict flame speeds, especially under fuel rich conditions, and ignition delay times for a large range of C1–C4 hydrocarbon fuels in good agreement with experimental data.
Result	This additional reaction sequence is via C6H8 formation, subsequent H-atom abstraction and n-C6H7 decompostionC6H8 + (H,OH) → n-C6H7 + (H2,H2O)n-C6H7 → A1 + HThe reaction sensitivity analysis (Fig. 13) at the position of the maximum concentration of benzene shows that the most sensitive reactions are the first and the last step of the pathway to benzene formation, i.e. propene H-atom abstraction und propargyl combination:C3H6 + H → C3H5 + H2C3H3 + C3H3 → A1Other sensitive reactions are related to reaction paths forming the intermediate C3H3.
Result	With the same model concentration profiles for major and intermediate species in fuel-rich, non-sooting, premixed C2H2-, C3H6- air flames and a mixed C2H2/C3H6 (1:1)-air flame at 50 mbar are predicted in good agreement with experimental data.
Method	Adding the set of reactions (R384)–(R394), which is rather small, including some global reaction steps, allows the prediction of early C6Hx>7 formation and of accurate C3H3/A1 concentrations.
Result	The path via n-C4H5 is contributing as much to benzene formation as in case of the acetylene flame.
Result	This is due to the addition of the HCCO decomposition reaction (R103) discussed above which lowered the maximum CO2 concentration again by 30%.
Result	Our simulation likewise showed that the benzene concentration is overpredicted in the post flame zone because of the persistent production via propargyl combination.
Result	Even for radicals like C3H3, C4H3 and C4H5 maximum concentrations and profiles are simulated very close to the experimental values.
Result	The minor route via C6H7 of the propene flame is neglegible in the acetylene/propene flame.
Object	An analysis of the main fuel consuming pathways is included.
Result	As demonstrated in Fig. 4 the absolute values and the temperature dependence (i.e. apparent activation energy) of the experimentally determined ignition delay times are well reproduced by the calculations.
Conclusion	The comparable high sensitivity of reactions (R258R) and (R383),C4H6 → C3H3 + CH3C3H3 + 3CH2 → C4H4 + Hshows that matching concentration profiles of C3 and C4-species simultaneously is essential (see Figs. 12(c–e) and 13).
Observation	In Fig. 14 the results of the mass flow and reaction sensitivity analysis are illustrated by a reaction flow diagram.
Observation	Using the rate coefficient for the backward reaction20CH3 + CH3 → C2H5 + Has recommended by Egolofopoulos reduces the flame speed by 2–4 cm s−1.
Conclusion	This fuel to fuel interaction is probably not fully considered by the model and likely to cause the discrepancies seen in the C2H2, CH3 and C3H3 mole fraction profiles.
Background	The C3H4 isomer propyne, C3H4P, is central for simulating propene oxidation.
Model	The C4H5 radical is mainly produced via the sequence of reactionsC3H3 + CH3 → C4H6C4H6 + (H,OH) → i-C4H5, n-C4H5 + (H2,H2O)This holds for all studied flames.
Model	The kinetic data relevant for benzene formation and destruction including additional species and C2–C4-reactions is based on the mechanism7 of Wang and Frenklach.
Observation	Where experimental data is available measured and predicted concentration profiles are displayed in figures.
Result	In case of the acetylene/propene flame one of the fuel components (acetylene) is formed to a large extent from the degradation of the other component (propene) and is thus present in very high concentrations in the late flame and post flame zone (see Fig. 18).
Object	Below those changes are discussed which have the greatest impact on the flame speeds of hydrocarbon flames and the species concentration profiles in the acetylene, propene, and the acetylene/propene flames.
Goal	Therefore the aim of this study is to demonstrate that existing models can be improved when expanded to a broader range of targets.
Result	Profiles for species with mole fractions >10−3 are predicted in excellent agreement with the experimental data.
Conclusion	It will be shown that on the basis of the mechanisms of Warnatz and coworkers and Wang and Frenklach a kinetic scheme can be compiled that fulfils the demands named above.
Background	Considerable progress has been made in the development of detailed reaction mechanisms being used in a manifold of scientific and industrial applications.
Result	The experimental flame structure analysis shows an earlier formation of species C6Hx,x>6 compared to benzene (A1).
Object	The A1 concentration profile was also simulated for the acetylene flame studied by Wang and Frenklach.
Result	Fig. 8 shows that the concentrations of benzene, A1 and the benzene precursors C3H3, C4H3, C4H5 are predicted in good agreement with experimental results.
Result	It is noteworthy to state that the original Warnatz scheme gave similar results with minor deviations for propene and butane air mixtures.
Motivation	Analysis of reaction pathways becomes more reliable with a larger set of test cases.
Conclusion	The propargyl radical is a key species for every reaction path found but its formation is fuel specific.
Background	Considering the acetylene flame in Wang and Frenklach’s study reaction (R449) was the major source for benzene.
Result	The high concentration of C2H2 in the flame zone not only boosts benzene formation via C3H3 but also via reaction (R449), n-C4H5 + C2H2, although only half of the fuel comprises acetylene.
Model	In the present study we adopted largely the experimental burning velocity data collected in the Princeton counterflow flames.17,18
Model	These reactions are listed for convenience in Table 1, where they are cited with their original source.
Background	The pioneering work of the named authors and many others has provided modeling tools for various aspects of hydrocarbon oxidation yet the application of every kinetic model is limted to its range of test cases.
Object	The structure of laminar premixed fuel-rich acetylene-, propene- and acetylene/propene-air flames34,12,35 was analyzed.
Model	The values of ref. 19 are results of shock tube experiments between 1000–1800 K and thus more appropriate for modeling high temperature hydrocarbon oxidation.
Result	Analysis of the reaction flow in the flame with the blended fuel yields the same reaction pathways from the fuel to benzene as seen for the pure fuel components, but relative distribution of different pathways are partially changed.
Result	The maximum benzene mole fraction is predicted 30% lower than with Wang and Frenklach’s model but within the experimental error.
Background	It should be noted that the influence of the HCCO decomposition reaction depends strongly on the thermodynamic properties of HCCO and the fuel/air ratio.
Result	The mass flow analysis shows that C3H6 is mainly consumed by H-atom abstractionC3H6 + H → C3H5 + H2and H-atom additionC3H6 + H → n-C3H7In the propene flame C3H3 is again formed to a high extent by the reactions of 3CH2 and 1CH2 with acetylene.
Result	In case of propene the propagyl radical cannot be formed directly from the fuel.
Result	Even benzene concentrations were predicted one order of magnitude too low.
Conclusion	Benzene formation via C3H5 + C3H3 is identified as a possible benzene source in propene flames.
Result	The maximum concentrations of C2H4 and further C3 and C4 species are also predicted within the error margins given as 30% for major species (mole fraction >10−3) and a factor of three for radicals and minor species (mole fraction<10−3) by Atakan et al.
Conclusion	In Flame 1 and 3 reaction (R*) does not significantly contribute to benzene formation and the simultaneous prediction of benzene concentration profiles for all flames is no longer possible without major changes to the kinetic model.
Model	The species nomenclature of C1–C4-species corresponds to ref. 2 and 3, thermodynamic data were taken from the Sandia National Laboratories database.15
Result	Another source is H-atom abstraction from propyne, an intermediate in the stepwise abstraction route from propene to propargyl.C3H4P + (H,OH) → C3H3 + (H2,H2O)A third important source of C3H3 is connected to the early formation of C6H8 as discussed above where C3H3 is formed by the reverse of reaction (R391).C6H8 + H → C3H6 + C3H3Benzene is formed predominantly by propargyl combination.
Model	The rate coefficients were taken either from literature or estimated based on analogous reactions.
Result	In the propene flame the C6H7 decomposition is a minor secondary source of benzene.
Conclusion	In principle reaction (R*) is a possible source of benzene in propene flames but it is not included in the mechanism for the reasons given above.
Background	The importance of these reactions is also emphasized by Pope and Miller13 (see also notes added in proof).41
Result	Acetylene addition to n-C4H5 is a secondary benzene source in the acetylene and the mixed acetylene–propene flame.
Background	Furthermore the early formation of CO2 in acetylene flames reported by Hoyerman et al. in 197237 can be explained via the sequence of reactions (R111) and (R107).
Background	Current values of flame speeds for hydrocarbons in air at atmospheric pressure differ significantly from older data.
Observation	In order to keep the main body of the paper short the full mechanism and the thermodynamic data are given as an electronic supplement.
Object	They are a vital part of the C3 chemistry derived here.
Result	The overprediction of the acetylene flame speeds for fuel-rich mixtures is due to the added HCCO decomposition being also discussed in the flame structure part.
Method	The reaction pathways leading to benzene are analysed by application of sensitivity and reaction flow analysis.
Model	They show in contrast to the old values a negative activation energy and the total rate is slower by one order of magnitude at 1000 K. The new experimental data for CH3 + O features the branching path producing CO which effects strongly the mass flow in methane flames.
Conclusion	Its high sensitivity on CO2 formation is due to a high HCCO channel fraction of the reaction C2H2 + O (reaction (R111)) being the main fuel consuming path.
Background	An experimental investigation of Atakan et al12. of a fuel rich propene flame indicates that additional reaction sequences via C6Hx,(x>6) are involved in benzene formation.
Result	Good agreement between predicted and the experimental concentrations is found for the major species H2, H2O, CO. The calculated concentration of CO2,(x=12 mm) is overpredicted by approximately 60%.
Result	The addition of the HCCO decomposition reactionHCCO → CH + COreduced the CO2 concentration maximum by 30%.
Model	The potential benzene precursor n-C4H3 is produced in all flames via the reactionsC4H2 + H → n-C4H3C4H4 + H → n-C4H3 + H2As a result of reaction flow analysis benzene is almost exclusively formed by the propargyl combinationC3H3 + C3H3 → A1while R449 is the main consuming path boosted by the high benzene concentrations.
Observation	The associated temperature profiles are shown in Figs. 5–7.
Observation	In Figs. 12 and 13 the mole fraction profiles of CH3, C2H2, C2H4, various C3/C4 and A1 species are displayed.
Result	The reaction paths via successive H-atom abstraction and the early formed C6H8 are characteristic for a propene flame.
Conclusion	Therefore additional chemistry was considered.
Result	The scheme is comparatively straightforward as the main benzene precursors are formed in one or two steps from the fuel molecule.
Conclusion	Additional kinetic and thermodynamic studies for this high sensitive reaction are desirable.
Background	This mechanism was moderately updated in .20008
Model	Some rate coefficients for H-atom abstraction reactions likeC3H5 + H → C3H4 + H2were slightly changed within the experimental error of the original reported values in order to predict simultaneously flame speeds for the same fuel.
Method	It should be noted that the considered allyl combination allowed a reasonable simulation of C6H10 concentrations but does not significantly contribute to benzene formation.
Result	The named changes to the C1–C2 chemistry and the new C3-chemistry compilation implemented to predict acetylene-/propene-flame structures lead also to good agreement between calculated and measured flame speeds of propane, propene and butane flames displayed in Fig. 3.
Method	The C2H5 + H rate is calculated via the equilibrium constant.
Background	Its concentration profiles could be reasonably well predicted even if the propargyl combination was excluded from the kinetic model.
Model	As already suggested by Atakan et al12. the allyl combinationC3H5 + C3H5 → C6H10and the reactionC3H6 + C3H3 → C6H8 + Hwere introduced, the latter analogously to C2H3 + C2H3.
Result	This effect is due to a decreased CO2 formation via the competitive reactionHCCO + O2 → H + CO + CO2which is a major source of CO2 under fuel rich conditions.
Conclusion	Flames 2 and 3 with different fuels show significantly more complex pathways but the route from acetylene is still an important route.
Background	As already pointed out by Wang and Frenklach the formation and destruction of benzene depends strongly on temperature and thus on the thermodynamic properties of the species involved.
Result	The reaction path to benzene via early formed C6H8 dicussed above is no longer essential to predict benzene concentrations, a match with experimental results could be achieved even when this channel is omitted.
Background	One aspect is modeling of hydrocarbon fuel oxidation including soot formation.
Observation	The results are illustrated in flow diagrams.
Background	In a recent flame study of C2H2/C3H6–O2 in Ar the concentration profiles of some intermediates are reported, although major species like H2 or CO are not included.35
Method	Especially these modifications enabled a simulation of the C3H4 concentration profile.
Model	The base for the C1-/C2- and C4-chemistry is the latest version of Warnatz’s mechanism.4
Result	In case of the propene flame the CO2 concentration profile is predicted within the experimental error of 30%.
Result	The C6H8 maximum concentration is predicted much too low when reaction (R*) is added and the latter reactions are excluded.
Conclusion	Therefore the relative sensitivity of reaction (R449) has the same value as in Flame 1.
Result	Another flow analysis revealed that benzene in this case is formed exclusively by n-C4H5 + C2H2 → A1 + H
Background	This approach is confirmed by a study of Qin et al14. for C3 fuel-oxidation.
Method	Cross-checking of this very broad range of targets is used to identify associated sets of sensitive reactions and to optimize the model.
Conclusion	Thus benzene formation cannot be described without a predominant contribution from reaction (R383).
Result	Acetylene is present in high concentrations in the flame zone because of the permanent C2H2 production from C3H6 degradation which is discussed above.
Result	The chemical structure analysis for fuel-rich C2–C3 laminar low pressure premixed flames shows fuel-dependent reaction pathways to benzene.
Method	For the present investigation the energy conservation equation was not solved explicitly and the temperature profiles were extracted from the experimental data.
Result	Benzene is produced in all flames predominantly by propargyl combination.
Result	Here acetylene is both fuel and intermediate.
Result	Especially the agreement in the dependence of the flame speed and mixture strength for ethylene under fuel rich conditions, displayed in Fig. 2, shows that flame speed and flame structure predictions, as discussed below, did not add up to a conflict with flame structure calculations.
Conclusion	The new mechanism predicts (a) the flame speeds of laminar premixed hydrocarbon–air flames for the fuels methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propene and butane in good agreement with the latest experimental data, (b) ignition delay times and species concentration profiles for various test cases of Warnatz’s mechanism in good agreement with experiments and (c) the concentration profiles of major and intermediate species in premixed, fuel-rich non-sooting acetylene– and propene–air flames and a mixed acetylene/propene–air flame including the propargyl radical and benzene.
Result	Fig. 1 reflects the very good agreement between predicted and experimental flame speeds for methane and ethane.
Background	With growing computing power modeling of various physical and technical systems becomes approachable or more realistic.
Model	This reaction has been extensively studied in the last decade21,22 and the latest results of Hoyermann and coworkers23 are included in the mechanism:CH3 + O → HCHO + HCH3 + O → CO + H2 + HThe reactionC2H5 + H → CH3 + CH3in Warnatz’s mechanism has already been identified by Egolofopoulos et al17. to raise ethane flame speeds significantly, when comparing predictions of laminar burning velocities on the basis of different detailed mechanisms and the experimental data.
Method	The results are compared with those of other experimental and computational studies with respect to the fuel, the temperature range and the vital role of the propargyl radical as a key intermediate in benzene formation.
Result	In particular the route via C2H2, the main route of the acetylene flame, consists of six steps but is still part of a main reaction path.
Conclusion	However, the results show that the model developed for pure fuels can be applied to a fuel mixture without substantial drawbacks.
Result	Fig. 10 illustrates the reaction paths from the fuel to benzene identified by reaction and mass flow analysis.
Method	It comprises large parts of Warnatz’s C3-chemistry but some modifications of key reactions were carried out which are very sensitive to the mass flow in propene flames.
Method	In the following a comparison of predicted and measured species concentrations is given with emphasis on major and intermediate species relevant for benzene formation and PAH growth.
Model	The C3H4 (allene/propyne) decomposition by C–H-bond breaking was described via the the backward reactionsC3H3 + H → C3H4C3H3 + H → C3H4PThe kinetic data are taken from Wang and Frenklach.7
Motivation	Thus it is desirable to provide a detailed reaction mechanism which is capable to predict flame structures, e.g. species concentration profiles, and global kinetic properties like flame speeds and ignition delay times simultaneously for a broad range of fuels.
Result	The isomerization of allene and propyne explains the relative high C3H4 mole fraction.
Background	The motivation to replace the GRI-C1-C2-chemistry in the original Wang–Frenklach-scheme is its limited reliability for fuels different from methane/natural gas as highlighted by the authors.5
Object	A detailed chemical reaction mechanism for the oxidation of hydrocarbons and its application to the analysis of benzene formation in fuel-rich premixed laminar acetylene and propene flames
Method	No specific modifications to the kinetic scheme were carried out to predict the structure of a acetylene/propene flame.
Conclusion	Further kinetic studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of early C6Hx formation.
Result	Here the highest relative sensitivity is found for propargyl combination and not for a fuel radical reaction because the fuel concentrations are diluted in the blended fuel (see Figs. 9 and 15).
Conclusion	This is a critical point when simulating benzene concentration profiles and further kinetic studies are necessary for solving this problem.
Result	The maximum position of C3H3 is shifted to higher burner distances matching the experimental data less accurately.
Observation	These data are summarized for all species in Table 2.
Result	These above-named changes to the C1–C2-chemistry lead also to a good match between calculated and measured flame speeds for acetylene and ethylene flames.
Result	In this simulation the n-C4H5 concentration was at the upper limit of the stated experimental error and the predicted A1 concentration was compared to the lower experimental limit.
Model	The detailed reaction mechanism consists of 569 reversible reactions and 96 chemical species.
Result	This applies for all three flames invesigated here.
Method	The experimental position data is slightly shifted to account for probe effects.
Conclusion	On the basis of existing detailed kinetic schemes a general and consistent mechanism of the oxidation of hydrocarbons and the formation of higher hydrocarbons was compiled for computational studies covering the characteristic properties of a wide range of combustion processes.
Result	A minor contribution is linked to the chemistry of C6H8, being formed early in the flame.
Method	This leads to better results for the partial equilibrium determined C2H2 concentrations in the post-flame region.
Background	Most of its reactions are formulated analogously to those of allene.
Observation	It can be seen that calculated concentrations of the fuel C2H2 and the radicals CH3 and C3H3 reach an almost constant level not detected in the experiment.
Method	The reaction pathways leading to benzene are traced back by application of reaction sensitivity and mass flow analysis.
Model	The experimentally found early formation of C6H8 in the propene flame is considered in the model.
Result	Computed ignition delay times of hydrocarbon–oxygen mixtures (CH4-, C2H6-, C3H8-, n-C4H10-, CH4 + C2H6-, C2H4, C3H6-O2) match the experimental values.
Result	This holds especially for intermediate species on the reaction paths leading to benzene (see Fig. 14).
Result	The experimental values are reproduced very well as seen in Fig. 9(d).
Method	This opens a new pathway to C3H3 and to benzene which is particular to the fuel propene as will be shown below.
Result	The most sensitive reactions are those discussed for the pure flames.
Method	In the field of combustion research modeling provides a strong tool for the analysis of chemical and physical phenomena and predictions of properties of combustion systems.
Model	However, the most of the key reactions accounting for benzene and benzene precursor formation are identical with the model of Wang and Frenklach as described in .ref. 7
Experiment	The species concentration profiles or maximum concentration/position data are taken from flame chemistry studies by Atakan et al. obtained with molecular beam sampling mass spectroscopy The calculations were performed with the flame and ignition codes used in the Chemical Kinetics group in Lund40.
Result	Yet predictions of profiles and maximum concentrations of C1–C4 key species taken into account agree reasonably well with the experimental data and are displayed in Figs. 16–18 or listed in Table 2.
Conclusion	An analysis of reaction pathways shows for all three flames that benzene formation can be described by propargyl combination.
Experiment	A summary of the conditions of the three well-studied burner stabilized laminar premixed flames simulated in the present study is given in Table 3.
Hypothesis	Obvious candidates for early C6Hx,x>6 formation are reactions of the species C3H6 and C3H5, being abundant early in the flame.
Background	Warnatz and coworkers1–4 have developed a widely-used mechanism for the oxidation of C1-C4-hydrocarbon fuels which is validated for flame speeds, ignition delay times and species concentration profiles.
Background	In a modeling study13 of benzene formation for C2 and C3 low pressure hydrocarbon flames (acetylene, ethylene, and propene) Pope and Miller found that besides propagyl combination the reaction C3H3 + C3H5 (allyl) → A1 + H + H reaction (R*) contributes significantly to benzene formation.
Observation	For many species only positions and values of the maximum concentration are provided.
Background	The GRI-mechanism5 is an extensively tested mechanism geared to methane and natural gas oxidation including NOx-chemistry and used as reference mechanism in many computational studies.
Method	The profiles actually used in the calculations (dashed lines in Figs. 5–7) are raised by 100–200 K which is well within the uncertainity of the applied temperature diagnostics, T(OH-LIF), T(CO,H2-Raman).12
Background	This elementary reaction was studied by Knyazev et al39. in detail.
Method	The new compilation of the C3 chemistry was essential to achieve these results.
Method	To obtain an optimal C3 data set, simultaneous optimisation of the kinetics of small and intermediate sized fuels was necessary.
Background	In a recent experimental study using time-resolved FTIR it was demonstrated by Osborn38 that CO2 is the main product for reaction (R107).
Result	When predicting concentration profiles for the pure flames this concentration evolution is not observed but too much C3H3 is predicted at high burner distances in the propene flame (Fig. 12).
Object	Since the mechanism derived here is developed and optimized for the oxidation of pure fuels its application to a blended fuel is a critical test.
Background	The former rate coefficients20 and reaction pathways are recommended for temperatures up to 1000 K which is far below flame temperatures.
Background	Most studies9–11 favour the combination of propargyl radicals C3H3 + C3H3 → A1 (reaction (R383), see mechanism in Table 1) to be the main source of benzene (A1, first aromat) while Wang and Frenklach7 demonstrated that in acetylene flames under certain conditions benzene formation can be described via alternative routes such as C4H5 + C2H2 → A1 + H, reaction (R449).
Result	Moreover, it is not limited to acetylene flames: Our calculations for methane/air flames and a comparison of experimental results and GRI predictions36 show that CH concentrations are reduced for lean mixtures and raised for fuel rich mixtures.
Result	A direct simulation with the Wang–Frenklach C6-chemistry resulted in C6H8 concentrations which are almost two orders of magnitude too low.
Result	This changes when propargyl combination is omitted in the kinetic model.
Model	In order to prove the quality of the presented mechanism and its general applicability this scheme was chosen without further modifications for the calculation of ignition delay times of a variety of fuels.
Result	The mass flow analysis of the reaction pathways from the fuel to benzene shows that C2H2 is mainly consumed by the reactionsC2H2 + O → 3CH2 + COC2H2 + O → HCCO + H.C3H3 is predominantly formed by the reactions of 3CH2 and 1CH2 with the fuel where 3CH2 and 1CH2 are the triplet and singlet methylenes respectively.C2H2 + 1CH2 → C3H3 + HC2H2 + 3CH2 → C3H3 + HThe rate coefficients of these C2H2/CH2 reactions and other pathways (R196,197,209,210) to C3H4/C3H4P (allene/propyne) are fitted to give optimum results for C3H3 and C3H4 concentrations profiles for all three flames.
Model	For species introduced with the chemistry of Wang and Frenklach’s mechanism the nomenclature corresponds to ref. 16 and thermodynamic properties are taken from .ref. 7
Background	The C1–C4 mechanism of Warnatz and coworkers, not validated against current flame speed data, overpredicts flame speeds for all fuel–air mixtures under study.
Method	Due to the extended application area the new compilation of the chemical scheme demands some modifications of the kinetic data.

Object	Novel Hückel stabilised azole ring-based lithium salts studied by ab initio Gaussian-3 theory
Result	The choice of electron correlation level and especially the basis set size (which is far from convergence) in the calculations may be the source of these differences and thus no definite conclusions based on these small differences in η should be drawn.
Result	The change, if true, could reflect a possible stabilising effect of all bonds being now equal in the ring of [N5C10]−.
Object	To estimate the change in energy upon the dissociation of the salts into cations and anions calculations on various Li+–[N5C2n]− ion pairs were made.
Background	Kim et al. have found a linear relationship between dissociation energies computed in this way and experimental lattice energies in the present energy range.13
Object	The third parameter is the chemical hardness (η), obtained from the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest un-occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the anions, using Koopmans' theorem.
Result	For [N5]− this is in agreement with earlier work.2,4,17
Result	Thus, the more charge withdrawn from the ring system by the CN-groups, the lower the aromaticity, a logical consequence.
Result	From this we infer that the C–C bonds outside the ring systems of the “a” isomers are responsible for the relative energy instabilities.
Model	The ion pairs depicted in Figs. 2a–h not present in Fig. 6 were either found by the second derivative calculations to be transition states: Li+–[N5]−:A, Li+–[N5C4a]−:A, Li+–[N5C8]−:A (all with imaginary B2 symmetry modes) or converged to another ion pair structure during the geometry optimisation.
Object	In addition, the volume and aromaticity of the anions have been evaluated.
Observation	Thus, the major jump in maxima ΔEel:−529 to −487 kJmol−1, an absolute decrease by 8%, occurs between [N5C6a]− to [N5C6b]− when this coordination is impossible.
Model	Initial calculations, to obtain reasonable starting values for the pure anion geometries as well as to screen possible 1∶1 lithium ion pair candidates, were made using ab initio Hartree–Fock (HF) methods employing the standard 6-31G* basis set (HF/6-31G*).
Object	Gaussian-3 theory calculations have been performed for a new family of lithium salts with heterocyclic anions–Li+[N5C2n]− (0 ≤ n ≤ 5).
Observation	However, it was found9 that each additional N–N bond, for structural isomers, increased the energy by 0.8 eV (∼77 kJmol−1) with a slight size dependency.
Observation	In Fig. 2a–h the resulting geometries of the anions at the MP2(full)/6-31G(d) level are schematically shown.
Object	First, the special stability of ring compounds, their aromaticity, is considered.
Result	Also, an imaginary line connecting the [N5C6a/b]−, [N5C8]− and [N5C10]− anion values has the same slope as a corresponding line connecting the three smallest anions; an anomaly as the charge withdrawing effect of each incremental CN-group is expected to be reduced.
Result	This is unexpected, as the charge withdrawn normally is believed to increase with the number of CN-groups.
Result	Symmetries of the other HOMO's are: [N5C6a]−: A2, [N5C8]−: A2, [N5C4a]−: B1, [N5C2]−: B1, [N5C4b]−: A2, [N5C6b]−: B1 We fail to find any trend of symmetry vs. energy for the orbital.
Result	The present value for the [N5]− N–N bond length (1.3421 Å) corresponds nicely to the values obtained by Gagliardi et al. (1.338 Å), Tang et al. (1.330 Å), and particularly well with Glukhovtsev et al. (1.342 Å).2,9,17
Model	A simple geometric measure, the double bond character index (I) as outlined by Nyulászi et al.,20 can be obtained by using the formula: Here B1i and B2i are the lengths of the isolated single and double bonds of type i, and R the length of the actual bond i in the ring, respectively.
Observation	From Fig. 6 it is clear that lithium ion bi-dentate coordination to two ring nitrogen atoms (B) is strongly preferred whenever possible.
Model	Geometry optimizations were performed for the H3C–CH3, H2C–CH2, H2N–NH2, HN–NH, H3C–NH2, and H2C–NH molecules to obtain reference values for the C–C, N–N, and C–N single and double bond lengths.
Observation	In Fig. 6 the obtained energies, ΔEel (HF/6-31G*), are plotted for the 1∶1 ion pairs schematically depicted in Fig. 2a–h.
Model	From Fig. 1 the preferred sub-steps for a scaling procedure are 1: HF/6-31G(d), 3: MP2(full)/6-31G(d), and 4: QCISD(T)/6-31G(d)//MP2(full)/6-31G(d), while step 6 is clearly inappropriate with its large spread.
Observation	Most [N5C2n]− anions are larger than the ClO4− and PF6− anions, smaller than TFSI, and on average comparable to BOB.
Background	While not treated here, the interactions with the solvent/matrix molecules are crucial to determine the dominant factor.
Result	Our values for the [N5]− anion are, however, closer to the very accurate CASPT2 calculations found in .ref. 2
Model	Several guesses for 1∶1 lithium ion pair minima were made for each anion and the relatively most stable ion pairs were transferred for further analysis.
Background	Such compound is the end member of a series on which our research groups have recently focused, as forming new types of lithium salts [e.g. Li(TADC) and Li(PATC)], where the anion is of the “Hückel” type, i.e. the charge is stabilised on a 5-membered azole ring formed by progressive substitution of nitrogens by the more electron-withdrawing (C–CN) group.6–8
Object	These values allow an estimation of the stability versus oxidation for a system, in practice reflecting the electrochemical window within which the anions can be used safely in a battery.
Background	[N5C10]− is an analogue to the cyclopentadiene anion that has a very large aromatic character.
Background	Tang et al9. computationally covered the range of the present anions, but reported only the most stable isomer for each value of n (i.e. [N5C4a]− and [N5C6a]− were not included).
Object	The safety and thus stability issues are of paramount importance for any practical usage of the present lithium salts, especially for battery applications.
Motivation	Application interest for anions with very high dissociation capabilities exists e.g. as counter-ions for metal catalysts in organic synthesis and in modern non-aqueous (liquid and solid) electrolytes for lithium batteries.11,12
Background	For electrolyte purposes a larger anion should lower the anionic part of the total ion conductivity, thus directly increase the cation (lithium ion) transport number, but might also reduce the overall ion conductivity due to increased viscosity.
Observation	The TADC anion is stable up to 4 V vs. Li+/Li0.21
Object	Eight different anions and the most stable 1∶1 lithium ion pairs have been studied for each anion.
Background	The [N5C4a]− and the [N5C6a]− anions are also known as the tri-azole di-carbonitrile (TADC) anion and pyrazole tri-carbonitrile (PATC) anion, respectively.6–8
Observation	Associated data are collected in Figs. 4 and 5.
Observation	Sub-step 2 has no associated energy value.
Conclusion	There is a paramount need for this kind lithium salts to obtain high ion conductivities in aprotic media in general, and especially in polymer electrolytes, where the importance of dissociation is even more stringent.
Object	Scaling factors based on these results can be used to extrapolate G3 Gibbs energies (G) for similar larger systems or for similar systems where a full G3 calculation for some reason fails.
Observation	For some anions, computational restrictions hindered a complete G3 calculation and therefore the relative error of the sub-calculations with respect to the final G3 results are shown in Fig. 1.
Conclusion	Thus the entire family of Li[N5C2n] salts keeps the promise to be excellent candidates wherever high ionic dissociation is needed.
Background	Arguably Gibbs energy values for the anions and the corresponding 1∶1 lithium ion pairs allow a simple theoretical measure of the dissociation of the lithium salts.
Model	Scaling factors will be used where needed in section C below.
Model	The volumes of the anions were determined on the MP2(full)/6-31G(d) level using a Monte Carlo based algorithm and a 0.001 e bohr−3 electron density cut-off.
Object	With this in mind we here use the highly accurate composite Gaussian-3 (G3) theory of Curtiss et al14. and apply to the [N5C2n]− (0 ≤ n ≤ 5) azole ring anions and their 1∶1 lithium ion pairs.
Observation	In Table 1 the obtained G3 Gibbs energies (G) of the [N5C2n]− (0 ≤ n ≤ 5) azole ring based anions are listed, together with the G3 enthalpy values (H) and all the Eel values (E) obtained from the sub-calculations performed during a composite G3 calculation in Gaussian98.
Object	Here we apply the scaling procedure to the ion pairs involving the [N5C8]− and [N5C10]− anions.
Observation	The charge of the ring increases from [N5]− (−1.0 e) to finally becoming positive for [N5C10]− (+0.09 e).
Observation	For both anions with D5d symmetry, [N5C10]− and [N5]−, the HOMO and LUMO have E1″ and E2″ symmetries, respectively.
Conclusion	Clearly all the salts presented in this study are as, or more, dissociated than the classical reference salts and on average on par with the LiBOB salt; the salts based on the larger anions being the more dissociated.
Observation	Noteworthy is that the energetically less stable [N5C4a]− and [N5C6a]− anions have larger I indices than their “b” isomers.
Observation	For the larger anions one possible resonance structure is shown.
Result	In20 it was found that the presence of nitrogen atoms in the ring increased the aromatic character of five-membered heterocycles, which the present data supports.
Observation	The present HOMO values are in the range −6.10–−5.10 eV.
Result	Our present ring bond distances are in general close to those of Tang et al., the worse comparison for [N5]− (Δ = 0.012 Å), while almost equal for the [N5C10]− anion (Δ = 0.001 Å).
Object	Finally, as the fourth measure of stability, the HOMO energies are used (Fig. 5).
Observation	It is difficult to interpret the different bond lengths individually for the structural isomers of [N5C4]− and [N5C6]−.
Result	By correlating all G3 sub-step level difference results whenever a full G3 calculation was successful, we find the best extrapolations to full G3 ΔG results to be obtained using sub-steps 4 and 1.
Goal	By using very accurate quantum mechanical methods, developed beyond the level of reproducing experimental data, thermodynamic data such as Gibbs energy differences (ΔG) can be predicted where experiments are yet to be made.
Model	In accordance with Tang et al9. only singlet state calculations were performed.
Background	This issue will be discussed further below.
Observation	The index for the [N5C10]− anion is larger than for the cyclopentadiene anion (0.475),20 though having the same ring atoms.
Model	Relevant reference values for single and double bonds were obtained as outlined in the computational details.
Result	Although these energy values not should be interpreted as absolute, all [N5C2n]− anions can be considered being rather stable towards oxidation.
Observation	For the C–N bonds our values are on average ca. 0.007 Å longer, while the C–C bonds are a similar amount shorter for [N5C6b]− and [N5C8]−.
Observation	In Fig. 3 the obtained volumes for the [N5C2n]− anions together with corresponding values for the ClO4−, PF6−, TFSI, and BOB anions18 are shown.
Motivation	This anion remained elusive until very recently,5 yet long time predicted by computational chemists to be relatively stable due to a large aromatic character.
Observation	Sub-step 7 has a low scattering, but this is the last step in a full G3 calculation.
Motivation	While many studies exist for the [N5]− anion this is not the case for the other members of this family.
Result	The data of Tang et al. also suggest a sudden shortening of the C–C ring bond length for [N5C10]−, compared to [N5C8]−, an effect that we do not observe.
Background	Some such derivatives of the [N5]− anion, ([N5C2n]−, (2 ≤ n ≤ 5), have been made before, but for most only in minute amounts by laser ablation techniques.9
Model	In this way, only a few ion pairs remained for each anion.
Motivation	Of special interest has been the existence of new all-nitrogen anions like the N5− pentagon.1–4
Result	Considering the scatter of the results in section A (Fig. 1) and in order for this method to be applicable to as many and large anions as possible, the recommended sub-step level is 1, though the sub-step level 4 results could be more slightly more precise.
Background	The recent combined experimental and computational DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) study9 and our own ab initio (HF/6-31G* and HF/Sadlej p-VTZ) studies6,7 seem to be all the relevant literature.
Conclusion	The lithium ion affinity of the anions decreases with the gradual CN-substitution and is thus lowest for the [N5C10]− anion.
Conclusion	Furthermore, the anions are aromatic and preliminarily due to be stable towards oxidation, thus having a wide electrochemical window.
Result	As seen in Fig. 5 the absolute HOMO values are quite irrational with respect to the calculation level, but the relative oxidation stability of the [N5C2n]− anions is the same: [N5C10]− > [N5C6a]− > [N5]− > [N5C8]− > [N5C4a]− > [N5C2]− > [N5C4b]− > [N5C6b]− Thus, for the [N5C4]− and [N5C6]− anions the lower HOMO energies are obtained for the “a” isomers, in contrast to the energy data in Table 1.
Conclusion	The stability vs. oxidation, inferred from the HOMO values, is large for all anions.
Object	Second, the charge remaining in the ring system, not withdrawn by the CN-groups, can be used as a measure of anion stability.
Model	Second derivative calculations (with respect to nuclei coordinates) were performed to validate the obtained stable structures as minima energy structures.
Background	The original synthesis of an [N5C4]− anion was made as early as .192310
Background	For the latter application a facile dissociation of the lithium salts into lithium ions and anions is of prime interest to obtain large numbers of charge carriers.
Observation	However, for the isomers of [N5C4]− and [N5C6]−, the index I and the hardness η give contradictory results with respect to their relative stability.
Observation	In Fig. 7 these 1∶1 ion pairs are also compared to computed G3 values for the Li+–PF6−, Li+–ClO4−, Li+–TFSI, and Li+–BOB ion pairs: −546, −564, ∼−586 and −486 kJmol−1, respectively.18
Conclusion	From the present computational results we suggest that synthesis efforts should primarily focus on anions where the bi-dentate coordination of the lithium ion to two ring nitrogen atoms (B) is inhibited i.e. the Li[N5C6b], Li[N5C8], and Li[N5C10] salts.
Model	The computationally highly demanding G3 theory calculations were then performed for these ion pairs and the anions.
Result	Therefore only the A, B, C, and D ion pairs, in total 15 structures, were subject to G3 theory calculations.
Experiment	All calculations were made using the program packages Spartan’0215 and Gaussian9816.
Object	The chemical hardness reflects how stable a specific system is towards chemical attack, and in general follows the index I for the [N5C2n]− anions.
Observation	However, both [N5C8]− and [N5C10]− are more aromatic than [N5C6b]−.
Model	These calculations used the final geometry optimization level in the composite G3 theory: MP2(full)/6-31G(d).
Background	This and the other [N5C2n]− anions are proposed to be chemically stable and their lithium salts to be very dissociated i.e. having very low lattice energies.
Observation	However, the [N5C4b]− anion behaves differently having about the same ring charge as the larger anions [N5C6a]− and [N5C6b]−.
Observation	In Fig. 7 the largest obtained ΔG for the 1∶1 ion pair dissociation for each choice of anion are presented.
Observation	The [N5]− anion index is very close to the theoretical maximum value of 2/3 and all [N5C2n]− anions are well above the theoretical minimum value of 0.40 (corresponding to two totally localised double-bonds).
Motivation	In recent years the hypothetical existence of various poly-nitrogen species has attracted scientific attention, mainly from theoretical chemists.
Observation	The energy values in Table 1 show increases of ∼55 and ∼70 kJmol−1, from [N5C4a]− to [N5C4b]− and from [N5C6a]− to [N5C6b]−, respectively.
Observation	The scaling factors obtained were: 0.9255 (±0.009) and 0.8916 (±0.007), respectively.
Object	In addition, the apex position central above the ring plane was tested for all anions, but found to be significantly less stable (for [N5]− this is in agreement with17).
Observation	For the mono-dentate coordination to CN-groups, E and E2, there is an almost linear decrease in ΔEel with n, but for all anions these minima are more than 40 kJmol−1 above the other minima energy ion pair.
Observation	The B and C structures are the most stable 1∶1 Li+–[N5C2n]− ion pairs.
Observation	The charge of the ring is approximately reversely proportional to the index I, especially for the smaller anions.
Model	Also the atomic charges, using the Mulliken scheme, and HOMO and LUMO values to obtain η, were obtained at this level of theory.
Conclusion	The present study shows that there is great promise to design new weakly coordinating, highly dissociated, anions without resorting to use of the most electronegative elements (F, O, Cl).
Observation	From index I an overall decrease in aromaticity from [N5]− (highly aromatic) to [N5C10]− is obtained (Fig. 4).
Conclusion	By applying G3 theory computations we have shown that the Li[N5C2n] salts have great promise to be highly dissociated.
Background	Aromaticity can be analysed in many different ways,19 being especially important for five-membered heterocycles.20
Observation	The volume of the “b” isomer of the [N5C6]− anion is significantly smaller than that of the “a” isomer.
Background	Hence, four different criteria are applied to theoretically assess the stabilities of the anions.

Result	The vibrational band shape of the strong N–N stretching vibration is more strongly influenced by shape and size than that of the N–O stretching vibration.
Method	In case of the dimer, trimer, and tetramer only the experimentally found isomers were calculated (Fig. 1a–c), which correspond to the most stable structures at all levels of theory.28,29,43–45
Observation	Considering that the interaction between the N2O molecules is dominated by dispersion forces this is not unexpected.
Model	For easier visualization each atom position was convoluted with a Gaussian profile (γ = 1 pm). r is the distance of the atoms from the center-of-mass of the cluster.
Background	The dimer, with its slipped-antiparallel structure is by far the best characterized complex.24–27
Observation	In the case of the tetramer we observe the same behavior as for the dimer, but the shift of the N–N-stretch is twice that of the N–O-stretch in all but the PM3 and HF calculations.
Result	B3LYP and PM3 completely fail to describe the cluster geometries.
Result	Therefore we did not include a Boltzmann factor while averaging over all calculated structures.
Model	This choice is justified by experiments, which showed that the clusters adopt the structure of the crystalline solid for cluster sizes as small as 30–40 molecules (see above).10
Background	Experimentally, all main cluster bands (v100, v001 and v101) are blue shifted with respect to the isolated molecule.2,4,5
Background	BLYP and B3LYP functionals tend to underestimate the attractive dispersion interaction (see ref. 64 and references therein) due to an erroneous asymptotic behavior at low densities.66,67
Result	Overall AM1 and MP2 describe the geometric properties of the N2O dimer best.
Observation	The cluster infrared absorption intensities reflect the pattern of the monomer calculations (compare Table 6).
Observation	It should be noted that a cluster with a crystal like head-tail orientation of the molecular dipole moments is not the most stable structure, but lies within the energy range mentioned above.
Observation	Otherwise Fig. 6 was generated in the same way as Fig. 5.
Observation	B3LYP, again, overestimates the intermolecular separation, because it does not include dispersion explicitly.
Observation	Random orientations of the molecules lead to a variation of the total stabilization energy between 10 and 20 kJ mol−1 or less than 0.5 kJ mol−1 per molecule.
Observation	The I100/I001 ratio is within 50% of the experimental value, and thus acceptable for the simulation of infrared N2O cluster spectra in the N–O- and N–N-stretch regions.
Result	This is particularly true for the sensitive torsional van der Waals vibration.
Hypothesis	Calculated infrared absorption intensities should reflect the experimentally observed intensities.
Observation	With increasing cluster size the band near 1295 cm−1 (C) gains intensity relative to the weaker structures (S) at lower wavenumbers.
Result	It is interesting to note that the related PM3 method fails in both categories, thus emphasizing the limited applicability of PM3 on nitrogen containing systems.
Conclusion	Obviously, there is no theoretical justification for the good performance of AM1.
Model	We calculated spherical (N2O)n clusters with n = 13, 19, 43, 55, 79, 135, and 177 molecules per cluster and averaged over N = 20, 16, 15, 10, 4, 3, and 1 structures, respectively.
Background	Miller et al. simulated a cluster containing 55 molecules using semiclassical Monte Carlo simulations.6
Observation	The density functional calculations require scaling factors which vary only by a few percent between the three fundamentals.
Observation	Experimental values are only available for the dimer,25,26,30 where we also added the frequencies of the two lowest van der Waals modes (Table 7).
Hypothesis	However, we expect the finite cluster extent in space in combination with the orientational disorder to influence the infrared spectra of large N2O clusters.
Observation	Experimental values obtained from high-resolution infrared spectra of the v101,24v100,25 and v001 bands26 are included for comparison.
Result	The paper is organized as follows: After a short section describing the computational details we present the ab initio results of the N2O monomer.
Background	In the past, oligomers like dimers, trimers, and tetramers as well as small particles with diameters ranging from nanometres to a few micrometres were studied extensively.1
Conclusion	It should be noted that none of the ab initio methods studied here describes all three categories (geometry, energetics, dynamics) equally well and fails to model at least one of them.
Observation	The bottom trace in Fig. 4 is the average of all 15 calculated structures (n = 43).
Background	The N2O monomer was studied at various levels of theory.36–42
Observation	The direction of μ (|μ| = 0.16 D52) was experimentally determined to be in agreement with a +NNO− charge distribution, corresponding to a negative sign of the dipole moment.62
Background	Infrared spectra of large N2O clusters were reported in supersonic jets via FTIR spectroscopy2–5 and vibrational predissociation,6 in collisional cooling cells,7 diffusion traps8 and in free-standing argon crystals.31
Observation	Since the van der Waals interaction is weak, the frequency shifts are small.
Conclusion	Stabilization energies and spectral band shapes confirm a crystal like structure of N2O clusters generated in supersonic jet expansions.
Observation	The A-constant is sensitive to the angle θ of the two N2O molecules forming the dimer unit and in particular to the angle φ of the top N2O molecule with respect to the A-axis.
Observation	The N–O-stretch wavenumbers of surface molecules with the oxygen-end pointing to or away from the center-of-mass of the cluster differ by ≈20 cm−1.
Background	In the less studied intermediate size regime, more rigorous quantum chemical methods may come into play, although high-level ab initio approaches are still restricted to small clusters.
Method	Energies given in this paper are not BSSE corrected.
Observation	PM3 predicts almost no shift at all for the N–N-stretch vibration.
Method	Although basis set superposition errors (BSSE) may amount to up to 50% of the van der Waals binding energy in these systems when using medium-size basis sets,43,44 a reordering of the isomers is only observed for small basis sets.
Background	The orientational disorder has no effect on the vibrational center.
Observation	In contrast the scaling factors for the HF frequencies vary by 8% or even more (HF/3-21G).
Model	In contrast to CO2 and because of the small permanent dipole moment of N2O, orientational disorder has to be considered.4,5,46–50,56–60
Observation	The spectra were averaged over the same number of structures as for the energy calculations.
Observation	Oligomers and large clusters differ in their microscopic structure.
Observation	The large differences between the spectra also indicate that the clusters studied here are still too small to provide a statistical orientational ensemble within a single cluster.
Observation	For comparison Fig. 2c shows the initial structure of a (N2O)55 cluster with a random alignment of the molecules in space, while their position was not changed from the one in Fig. 2a.
Observation	A similar blue-shift was observed for the ν001-band of nanometre-sized CO2 clusters.7,8,11–14,71
Background	Clusters containing up to several thousands of molecules represent intermediate states of matter between the gas and the condensed phase.
Observation	Except for the N–O-stretch vibration, which is a factor of five too weak at the MP2 level, the absolute intensities agree within their expected uncertainty.
Conclusion	Since the S features of the N–O-stretch vibration (Fig. 5) are reproduced by our simulations and could be assigned to surface molecules,4,5 we can conclude that the cubic structure is adopted even at the cluster surface.
Result	It should be emphasized again that AM1 uses a minimal valence basis set without polarization or diffuse functions and that electron correlation is only included implicitly through the parametrization.
Observation	The basis set size mostly affects the bending vibration ω010, but the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is sufficient to reproduce all experimental fundamentals within 1%.
Observation	The calculated frequencies in Fig. 6 were scaled by 0.829,4,5 which is the scaling factor of the monomer N–N-stretch vibration.
Observation	Fig. 8 shows the N–N- (a) and N–O-stretch (b) spectra of an amorphous like (N2O)55 cluster (compare Fig. 2).
Background	The former have a parallel arrangement of N2O molecules, whereas the latter are derived from the cubic structure of the crystalline solid, where no parallel arrangement of neighboring molecules occurs.
Result	However, the good agreement between simulated and experimental results justifies the use and scalability of AM1 to simulate the properties of large N2O clusters and confirms the conclusions derived from it.4,5
Observation	In contrast to H-bonded systems, there is no intensity amplification, at best a slight attenuation, upon cluster formation, which renders detection by direct absorption more difficult.
Hypothesis	Our results encourage the application of AM1 to large (N2O)n (n > 4) clusters, although we have no proof for scalability.
Observation	After geometry optimization with the semiempirical AM1 method (Fig. 2b) the geometry is slightly disturbed, but the cubic structure with its “shells” is largely maintained.
Observation	Therefore it is necessary to average over several orientational distributions in order to compare simulated with experimental spectra.
Observation	Similar to the dimer B3LYP underestimates the B and C constants, or, in other words, the intermolecular separation is calculated to be too large.
Model	Each group of peaks corresponds to what we can call a shell of N2O molecules around the center-of-mass.
Object	In the preceding sections we have demonstrated the suitability of the semiempirical Austin Model 1 (AM1) in describing the properties of small N2O clusters.
Observation	Most important, though, is the comparison between the different methods.
Observation	The deviations are even larger when PM3 is used.
Observation	AM1 is the next best method, despite an underestimation of the angle θ by about 5°.
Background	The difficulties in calculating the electric dipole moment μ of nitrous oxide (Table 1) were discussed in detail by several groups.39–41
Observation	The parallel arrangement of molecules in the dimer, trimer and tetramer does not occur in the cubic structure of large clusters.
Background	Kudoh et al45. compared DFT results with matrix spectra and Miller and co-workers used the calculated rotational constants at the MP2 level of theory to assign their spectra to the N2O trimer28 and tetramer.29
Observation	For MP2 and B3LYP the results are largely basis set independent.
Observation	At the Hartree–Fock level neither the absolute nor the relative intensities are close to experiment.
Observation	In the case of the weaker ν100 band (transition dipole moment of dM = 0.130 D),72 the shape effect is not very pronounced and can be traced back to the increased surface of the columns.
Result	On the other hand the good B3LYP performance is inconsistent with the poor description of the interaction potential.
Observation	Table 1 shows the calculated bond lengths rNN and rNO as well as the calculated dipole moment μ of N2O at different levels of theory for a range of basis sets.
Observation	A similar situation is observed in case of the trimer and tetramer (Table 8).
Result	However, AM1 does not reproduce floppy intermolecular angles well, while MP2 overestimates the intramolecular N–N distance.
Observation	With increasing basis set size the dissociation energy at the HF level drops below the MP2 values.
Observation	At the same time we observe a contraction of the cluster by about 0.5 nm.
Model	As expected, the effect of averaging is strongest for smaller clusters and less pronounced for larger clusters, where the number of N2O molecules is large enough for good statistics even within a single cluster.
Observation	As for the B3LYP calculations, the results are again independent of the size of the basis set, but rc.m. is consistently overestimated by about 0.3 Å, causing the B and C constants to be too small.
Observation	The lowest frequency bands correspond to surface molecules with the oxygen-end pointing toward the center-of-mass, while molecules pointing in the other direction show spectral features underneath C.
Observation	All simulated spectra were scaled by the monomer scaling factors, which differ only slightly for the N–O- and N–N-stretch vibrations (Table 5).
Conclusion	This suggests that all methods but MP2 are suitable for spectral intensities of larger N2O clusters, although the absolute intensities are off in some cases.
Observation	However, HF/3-21G completely fails to give a reasonable agreement with the experimental N–O distance.
Observation	Vibrational frequency shifts for the dimer, trimer and tetramer are summarized in Tables 7 and 8, together with the absorption intensities.
Background	Signorell pointed out that pure resonant dipole–dipole coupling would lead to a small blue shift of both stretch vibrations in the N2O dimer.51
Observation	No further frequency adjustment was made to match simulated and experimental spectra.
Goal	The major focus of the paper is to demonstrate the good performance of the AM1 method and to compare the results with systematic quantum chemical calculations at different levels of theory.
Observation	The amorphous like structure results in broad spectra with little resemblance to experimental and simulated spectra of crystal like clusters (compare Figs. 5 and 6).
Background	The trimer structure can be derived from the dimer by placing a third N2O molecule diagonally over the other two, which are tilted against each other along the torsion coordinate.28
Goal	The semiempirical Austin Model 1 (AM1) was used to describe the structures, energetics and dynamics of N2O and its clusters.
Background	It is worth noting that the cubic structure of the large clusters is quite different from the parallel alignment of the molecules in the dimer, trimer, and tetramer, which is probably the reason for the opposite v100 (N–O-stretch) vibrational band shifts of oligomers and large clusters.4,5
Background	Vibrational frequencies are most easily calculated at the harmonic level.
Observation	Thus we expect A to have the largest deviations from the experimental values, which is confirmed by Table 3.
Method	Recently Zhang et al66. and Wesolowski et al67. suggested that the PW91 exchange and correlation functionals are possible alternatives to describe weakly bound complexes.
Conclusion	A similar result was found experimentally for nanometre-sized CO2 clusters10,73.
Observation	Dipole contributions are almost negligible.
Result	The close match of the HF/6-31+G(d) calculation with the experiment is probably fortuitous, considering the previous results for the monomer, dimer and trimer.
Conclusion	Overall, AM1 reproduces experimental results (structure and vibrational frequencies) and MP2 dissociation energies of small N2O clusters far better than any other quantum mechanical method studied here, although AM1 is not explicitly calibrated for the (N2O)n van der Waals system.
Observation	CCSD(T) calculations perform significantly better.
Observation	Intramolecular bond lengths do not change much upon cluster formation (compare Table 2) and are not reported.
Observation	MP2 calculations perform best in terms of a common scaling factor and also in terms of absolute frequencies.
Observation	At PM3 level, the trimer structure studied here is not a minimum on the potential surface.
Result	Except for the dimer, the agreement of the AM1 energies with the MP2 values is surprisingly good, despite a lack of polarization and diffuse functions and the fact that electron correlation is taken into account only implicitly in the parametrization.
Observation	Our simulations show an increase of the band marked S2 (≈2236 cm−1) relative to C with increasing cluster size.
Observation	A, B and C are the usual rotational constants.
Observation	We observed an excellent agreement with experimental spectra in the case of the N–O-stretch vibration.
Result	For the aug-cc-pVDZ basis the SCF part is even repulsive at the minimum geometry and the trimer and tetramer are only held together by correlation effects.
Observation	Upon inclusion of electron correlation at the MP2 level, the N–O distance improves, but the N–N distance is overestimated.
Model	Columnar clusters (Fig. 1e) were built using a base of 2 × 2 unit cells and a length of 2, 3 and 4 unit cells, corresponding to cluster sizes of 63, 88 and 113 molecules per cluster, respectively.
Object	When discussing the infrared spectra of nanometre-sized N2O clusters we will compare the band-shapes of simulated and experimental spectra (see section 4.2).
Model	Fig. 2a reflects the regular cubic structure of the initial geometry.
Observation	Because of the random alignment, the positions of the nitrogen and oxygen ends are spread out.
Method	The calculated frequencies were folded with a Gaussian profile (γ = 3 cm−1) and scaled by 0.802,4,5 which is the scaling factor for the monomer N–O-stretch vibration (compare Table 5).
Background	Dutton et al43. presented HF, MP2, and MP3 calculations of the dimer, confirming previous results by Nxumalo et al.44
Result	It is worth noting that PM3 cannot describe N2O clusters adequately, although AM1 and PM3 have the same theoretical underpinning and differ only in the amount of experimental reference data and the optimization techniques used in the parametrization.
Observation	Hartree–Fock overestimates both shifts by at least a factor of two.
Observation	Both, the energetics and the spectral band shapes, confirm a crystal like structure of the N2O clusters.10
Result	In the inner region, where each molecule is surrounded by neighbors, the wavenumbers of a molecule pointing in one or the other direction differ only by a few cm−1, confirming the results of molecular dynamic simulations of the crystalline solid.46,48,49
Method	Semiempirical PM3, restricted Hartree–Fock (HF), hybrid density functional (B3LYP), and second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory calculations were applied to the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer.
Result	Thus, the geometry optimization does not change the arrangement within the initial cubic structure, being in accord with experimental results that even N2O clusters containing only a few tens of molecules take up the cubic structure of the crystalline solid.10
Observation	However, the MP2 shifts are much smaller than, for example, at the AM1 or B3LYP level.
Conclusion	The semiempirical AM1 method is found to describe the structure, energetics and dynamics of oligomeric N2O clusters well, without any further parametrization.
Conclusion	AM1 is one of these cases, but it agrees best with the experimental frequency shifts.
Observation	AM1 performs better, but it consistently overestimates all three intensities.
Background	Because the frequencies of intermolecular van der Waals modes are more than one order of magnitude smaller than those of the intramolecular stretching vibrations, the principal nature of the stretching fundamentals does not change upon cluster formation and we can still describe the cluster vibrations as, e.g., N–O-stretch vibrations.
Result	Fig. 8 indicates once again that N2O clusters containing a few tens of molecules adopt the cubic structure of the crystalline solid.10
Conclusion	Therefore, in the present systematic work, we have carefully validated the use of AM1 for the modelling of N2O clusters.
Goal	In the following sections we will present and discuss the properties of large N2O clusters at AM1 level.
Background	Electron diffraction studies on large clusters of the structurally related N2O9 and CO210 molecules indicate that their microscopic structure is similar to that in the crystalline solid.
Observation	It should be noted that C is very close to the N–O-stretch vibration of the crystalline solid (1292.5 cm−1).34
Observation	The opposite sign is reproduced by all but the MP2 calculations, where both stretches are red-shifted and the ω100 shift is only a fraction of the observed value.4,5
Observation	The latter is also the reason for the deviation of the rotational constant A, because the A-axis lies approximately along the intermolecular center-of-mass distance.
Object	So far we considered only spectra of clusters with the cubic structure of the crystalline solid.
Background	The tetramer is basically a sandwich structure of two dimers where all N2O molecules are parallel to each other and the oxygen atoms of adjacent molecules are pointing in opposite directions.29
Observation	The sharp peaks indicate the positions of the central N-atoms in each N2O molecule and “shell”.
Observation	Both semiempirical approaches have difficulties in describing the bending vibration of N2O. It is underestimated by about 50 cm−1, indicating that the potential energy surface is too flat in the bending coordinate.
Observation	Vibrational analysis shows that the major source of the differences between the spectra is the orientation of the molecules at the cluster surface.
Observation	The dipole moments in Table 1 were calculated at the optimized geometries of the individual methods.
Result	The good agreement for the total interaction energies (see above) is thus fortuitous, but together with the performance for the cluster geometry, it suggests that the AM1 method may be applied to larger clusters, where high level ab initio calculations are not feasible.
Result	Hence, S2 reflects the dynamics of the crystalline solid rather than that of large clusters, whereas the experimental cluster band (C) is blue shifted by about 10 cm−1 with respect to the crystalline solid.
Observation	The deviations for the HF calculations are not as large, but still off by about 0.1 Å.
Observation	The amorphous structure is about 70 kJ mol−1 less stable than the one with a crystal like alignment, consistent with the experimental observation.10
Conclusion	The good performance of AM1 for N2O clusters must be attributed to some fortuitous error compensation, though AM1 is known to describe nitrogen-containing compounds generally better than MNDO.22,23
Observation	MP2 predicts the wrong sign, because it overestimates the contribution of the resonance structure over .
Result	Overall our simulated spectra resemble the spectral features and evolution of the experimental cluster spectra nicely.
Background	Molecular dynamics simulations were used to describe the orientational disorder in crystalline nitrous oxide.46–50
Result	The failure of MP2 cannot be explained simply by geometry effects, because the N–N- and N–O-bond lengths are changing by the same amount in all calculations (see Table 2) and imply opposite signs of the frequency shifts.
Goal	Large N2O clusters containing up to 177 molecules were simulated using the semiempirical AM1 method.
Observation	As we go from the dimer to the trimer and tetramer the dissociation energy increases by a factor of about three and five to six, respectively, in line with the growing number of pairs.
Observation	AM1 reproduces the signs and magnitudes of the shifts for all but the main N–N-stretch cluster band (S2 in Fig. 6), the latter being underestimated by a factor of two, but matching the limit of the crystalline solid.
Result	Dipole–dipole interactions, arising from the small permanent dipole moment of N2O (0.16 D, ref. 52), play only a minor role.
Conclusion	Among the ab initio methods, MP2 best reproduces the experimental geometries and can be assumed to be most reliable in the prediction of dissociation energies.
Model	In order to break the high symmetry of the cubic structure the N2O molecules were randomly displaced by a few tenths of an Å from the position in the crystalline solid, ensuring a C1 symmetry of the initial geometry for the geometry optimization.
Background	Only recently the first observation of a van der Waals mode in (N2O)2 was reported by Havenith and co-workers.30
Observation	PM3 fails to describe the intermolecular distance.
Result	Indeed, these “surface modes” are spread over the full spectral region of the N–O-stretch vibration and are partly covered by the main cluster band C.
Observation	Semiempirical and Hartree–Fock methods overestimate the contribution of and, hence, the magnitude of the dipole moment, though the sign is correct.
Background	Vibrational band shapes are more sensitive to orientational disorder than energies.
Observation	While the calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.802 (see above), no scaling or normalization was applied to the calculated intensities.
Observation	Agreement with the experimental values is best at the MP2 level.
Observation	The HF calculations use rather modest basis sets and underestimate the N–N distances, as one would expect for a purely covalent system.
Result	The AM1 values for the parallel and perpendicular components of the polarizability tensor in N2O are 4.99 and 0.36 Å3, respectively, and thus smaller than the experimental values52 of 5.33 and 2.16 Å3, so that the interactions involving polarizabilities will be underestimated by AM1.
Observation	Quite in contrast the differences are significant for ν001 (dM = 0.249 D),72 making this band less suitable for the testing of the AM1 model, as long as the experimental shape remains unknown.
Observation	The agreement between simulated and experimental N–N-stretch spectra is not as good.
Observation	Quadrupole interactions are more sizeable, but dispersion forces dominate the direct neighbor interaction.
Observation	First of all, the intramolecular N–N and N–O bond lengths (not shown) are barely influenced upon cluster formation, as one would expect for a weakly bound van der Waals cluster, though the N–O- and N–N-distances are systematically increasing or decreasing, respectively, by one or two thousandths of an Å.
Model	The initial structures of large (N2O)n clusters were derived from the cubic structure of crystalline N2O.55
Observation	If we just consider the strongest trimer vibrations, then the N–O and N–N vibrational frequency shifts have again opposite sign, even at the MP2 level.
Background	N2O clusters belong to the class of van der Waals clusters and a large experimental data set is available for them.
Observation	In a microscopic picture this is also true for the alignment of the individual N2O molecules.
Background	In the following we will concentrate on the two stretching vibrations v100 and v001, but we will discuss other modes as well where experimental data exist.
Observation	Both semiempirical methods, AM1 and PM3, reproduce the experimental atomic distances quite well.
Result	The contraction is a consequence of the cluster’s finite extent in space and also of the overestimated AM1 rotational constants (Tables 2 and 3).
Observation	B3LYP deviates systematically from all other calculations in giving much smaller dissociation energies for all cluster sizes consistent with the overestimated intermolecular distance.
Model	Here, orientation means that a N2O molecule is either pointing in one direction or turned over by 180°, thus fixing the alignment in space to the one found in the crystalline solid.
Observation	The experimental values are given in the first row for comparison.52,61
Goal	Earlier in the paper the construction of large spherical N2O clusters from the cubic structure of the crystalline solid, with a single N2O molecule at the center of the sphere was described.
Background	Some examples are clusters of N2O,2–9 CO2,8,10–14 SF6,15–17 and H2O.18–21
Model	The MP2 calculations include only valence orbitals, i.e., the frozen core approximation was used.
Result	HF/3-21G, the simplest and fastest pure ab initio method used here fails for both intra- and intermolecular parameters.
Result	As will be seen later, the interaction between the N2O subunits is dominated by dispersion forces.
Model	Basis sets ranging from 3-21G to double- and triple-ζ quality were used.
Goal	As was mentioned earlier, we generated several cluster structures with different orientational distributions for a given cluster size.
Conclusion	Overall AM1 gave a surprisingly good description of the monomer and small clusters (n ≤ 4).
Model	Fig. 2a shows the radial atom number density of a (N2O)55 cluster prior to the geometry optimization.
Observation	Thus the calculated equilibrium values may differ substantially from the experiment.
Background	For the strong ν001 band, one should also consider shape effects due to through-space transition dipole coupling.1,51
Result	Simulated spectra of different cluster sizes show excellent agreement with experimental spectra.
Object	Fig. 4a-g shows the infrared spectra in the N–O-stretch region of seven such structures of (N2O)43.
Goal	We compared the performance of AM1 with higher level quantum chemical methods and experimental results.
Observation	This is especially important for the trimer having a floppy and flat potential with respect to the angle φ of the top N2O molecule lying across the other two.28
Observation	AM1 shows perfect agreement with the experiment, followed by B3LYP, which slightly underestimates the frequency shifts.
Observation	Table 4 shows the dissociation energies D0 of the dimer, trimer and tetramer for fragmentation into monomers.
Observation	For the comparison, one should note that the experimental values represent vibrationally averaged rotational constants.
Conclusion	Indeed it is the only theoretical method studied here which describes the structures, energies and vibrational frequencies with consistently acceptable accuracy.
Background	On the spectroscopic level the orientational disorder relaxes the electric-dipole selection rules, resulting in a broadening of the vibrational band shapes, which is among the most significant differences between the structurally related systems N2O and CO2.46–50,56–60
Observation	Here, AM1 agrees well with the experiment.
Observation	Within their uncertainty, the predictions would also be consistent with the anti-geared bending vibration, but this is not the experimentally preferred assignment.30
Observation	For the trimer and tetramer at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level ZPE was estimated from the MP2/6-31+G(d) results, with an expected error on the order of 1 kJ mol−1.
Observation	No attempt was made to reach the basis set limit for the monomer, as we are aiming at cluster calculations.
Conclusion	Except for intermolecular angles and absolute infrared absorption intensities AM1 reproduces experimental results and MP2 dissociation energies far better than expected for a semiempirical method, which is not explicitly calibrated for such systems.
Observation	With increasing cluster size the dissociation energy per molecule approaches a limit of around 20 kJ mol−1, which is within 20% of the experimental sublimation enthalpy (Fig. 3).56
Model	Energetic and spectral properties of columnar clusters were averaged over three orientational distributions for each cluster size.
Result	At the MP2 level the major contribution to the binding energy comes from electron correlation (see Table 4), reflecting the dominant part of dispersion interactions.
Observation	Both spectra were averaged over four structures with a random alignment of the molecules.
Observation	AM1 overestimates the A constant.
Observation	The B3LYP functional gives good structural results which are largely insensitive to the size of the basis set.
Observation	The cohesive energy in N2O clusters appears to be largely additive.
Result	Even surface molecules do not realign much during the geometry optimization, but rather retain the initial alignment of the underlying cubic structure.
Observation	After the geometry optimization (Fig. 2d) the atom number density is more uniformly distributed than in Fig. 2b, consistent with an amorphous structure.
Background	Later the trimer28 and tetramer29 were studied in the region of the v101 combination band and the assignments were supported by ab initio calculations of the rotational constants.
Observation	Table 5 summarizes the calculated harmonic frequencies for the N2O monomer at different levels of theory.
Observation	Table 6 lists the calculated and experimental intensities of the three fundamental modes of N2O. Because absolute absorption intensities involve large errors, we will concentrate on the relative intensities, which are given in parentheses.
Object	The performance of the semi-empirical AM1 method on small and nanometre-sized N2O clusters
Observation	They are indeed larger, but fall short of the MP2 results by roughly a factor of two.
Observation	The rotational constants are in good agreement with the experimental values as well, because small errors in the intramolecular distances have only little influence on the rotational constants.
Result	Therefore other effects must play a crucial role in explaining the MP2 red shifts.
Method	Geometry optimizations with the semiempirical Austin model 1 (AM1)22,23 were carried out using the Gaussian 98 program package.
Observation	The 3-21G basis set was included to have a measure of how well a simple ab initio method, applicable to clusters beyond ten molecules, describes the system.
Result	The coincidence between MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and RHF/3-21G is due to basis set superposition, which behaves qualitatively like dispersion.
Background	However, the v001 (N–N-stretch) cluster band2–5 is blue shifted by about 10 cm−1 relative to the TO-mode of the crystalline solid,8,12–14,32–35 even for large clusters with up to 109 molecules per cluster,11 whereas the cubic structure of the crystalline solid is adopted at a cluster size as small as ≈30–40 molecules.10
Observation	Fig. 7 compares simulated spectra for columnar clusters with those of the spherical shapes.
Observation	Table 2 summarizes the structural parameters for the N2O dimer, which is planar with C2h symmetry (see Fig. 1a). rc.m. is the center-of-mass distance of the N2O subunits and θ the small angle between the molecular N2O axis and the center-of-mass distance rc.m..
Background	According to a detailed vibrational analysis both bands (C and S2) have similar contributions from the clusters interior and the effect of different orientations of surface molecules is less pronounced.4,5
Observation	We limit ourselves to four different structures, but obviously further averaging would reduce individual features even further.
Result	Our results confirm those of a systematic study of Frisch and Del Bene at various levels of theory.39
Observation	The trimer has three infrared active modes for each vibration.
Observation	Fig. 5 also includes an experimental jet-FTIR spectrum of a 7.5% mixture of N2O in helium.4,5
Method	For the calculation of harmonic force constants and infrared intensities of clusters containing more than 79 molecules as well as the geometry optimization of (N2O)177 the MNDO9754 program package was used.
Observation	Visual inspection would indicate a cluster size of about 100 molecules per cluster for the experimental spectrum in Fig. 5.
Result	Moreover, intermolecular interactions were not considered during the AM1 parameterization:23 van der Waals and H-bonded clusters were not among the reference molecules, and the reference data did not include polarizabilities which are crucial for the description of dispersion interactions.63
Observation	All other calculations overestimate the torsional frequency, but MP2 is within the expected uncertainty for such a low frequency vibration.
Background	It is now well known that even clusters built out of one billion molecules do not match the dynamic properties of the bulk phase in every detail, although their microscopic structure is often the same.
Result	This may be due to shape or size effects caused by the strong transition moment, resulting in an anomalous blue shift of the experimental main cluster band C (Fig. 6) relative to the crystalline solid.2,4–8,11–14,71
Observation	The dissociation limit is close to the experimental sublimation enthalpy of 24 kJ mol−1 at 136 K.56
Observation	A similar spectral evolution is observed in ragout-jet FTIR spectra as a function of N2O concentration,2,4,5 in agreement with our theoretical results.
Background	It is common to apply a simple scaling factor to correct for the anharmonicity and for errors in the electronic structure approach.
Observation	The experimental anharmonic values are given for comparison and the values in parentheses are the ratios of the experimental anharmonic and calculated harmonic frequencies.
Model	In order to break the cubic symmetry each molecule was randomly displaced by 0.1 Å and randomly oriented along the molecular axis prior to the geometry optimization.
Result	The relative intensity change with increasing cluster size (for example, of the N–O-stretch vibration) is comparable for all but the MP2 calculations.
Observation	In case of the more spherical tetramer the differences between the methods are smaller.
Observation	The intensity of the N–N-stretch vibration (I001) was set to 100% for each calculation.
Conclusion	PM3 and HF cannot describe either of them.
Background	Stabilization energies of the clusters are crucial for an understanding of their formation.
Observation	PM3 overestimates the intermolecular separation of the N2O molecules and, hence, gives rotational constants much smaller than the experimental values.
Observation	We checked the significance of the features by block-averaging only half of the calculated structures.
Observation	In order to obtain D0 electronic energies were corrected by zero-point energy (ZPE), except for AM1 and PM3, which include the zero-point motion implicitly in the parametrization.63
Conclusion	It fails to describe the frequency shift of the N–N-stretch vibration and the band strength of the N–O-stretch vibration.
Observation	It should be noted, however, that S2, the dominant band in our simulations, is rather close to the N–N-stretch frequency in the crystalline solid (2237 cm−1,34 marked with Cr in Fig. 6).
Background	The theoretical treatment of such large clusters is restricted to model potentials and typically involves molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo and exciton approaches.
Observation	All other methods predict the correct direction of μ, but only CCSD(T) reproduces its magnitude reasonably well.
Observation	An experimental jet-FTIR spectrum of 7.5% N2O in helium4,5 is included for comparison (bottom trace).
Observation	For the dimer and tetramer only one mode of the N–O- and N–N-stretch vibrations is infrared active, the others not being listed in the tables.
Observation	For the N–N-stretch vibration, agreement with experiment is not as good as for the N–O-stretch band (Fig. 6).
Conclusion	It seems to benefit from fortuituos error compensation and the results obtained here cannot be transferred easily to other systems, as was recently shown by Signorell for the structurally related CO2 dimer.51
Conclusion	AM1 reproduces the structures, energetics, vibrational frequencies and absorption intensity changes with reasonable accuracy, but at a fraction of the cost of high level ab initio calculations.
Observation	Thus, we can easily assign the band C to molecules in the cluster core.
Conclusion	The good performance of AM1 allows us to simulate N2O clusters built from hundreds of molecules, a size range neither accessible by ab initio nor by continuum methods.
Observation	Table 3 summarizes the calculated and experimental28,29 rotational constants of (N2O)3 (C1 symmetry, Fig. 1b) and (N2O)4 (D2d symmetry, Fig. 1c).
Model	For the DFT calculations the default pruned (75,302) grid of the Gaussian 98 package was used.
Model	Starting from a central N2O molecule a spherical section with radius r was cut out of the crystal structure, thereby generating approximately spherical particles with radii between 0.4 and 1.3 nm (Fig. 1d).
Background	However, up to now no systematic ab initio study of small N2O clusters is available at different levels of theory employing different basis sets.
Conclusion	All other methods (PM3, HF, B3LYP, and MP2) show larger deviations in at least one of the categories.
Goal	In this work we validate the exceptionally good performance of the semiempirical AM1 method22,23 on N2O clusters, which allowed us to study their structural, energetical and dynamical properties up to 177 monomer units and to compare them with experimental and theoretical results obtained previously.
Result	In general an orientation of the surface molecules with the oxygen-end pointing away from the center-of-mass is energetically favored.
Conclusion	B3LYP overestimates intermolecular distances and largely underestimates dissociation energies.
Observation	To verify this for the N2O system, we have included PW91 dissociation energies into Table 4.
Observation	Fig. 1c shows a small tilting of the oxygen end of each N2O molecule toward the center-of-mass, which is more pronounced at the MP2 level and results in nearly identical values for all three rotational constants.
Observation	It shows a broad, smeared-out band at about 1295 cm−1 and two smaller bands of nearly equal intensity at lower frequencies.
Result	Given these limitations, the results of semiempirical calculations must be carefully checked against experiment or high-level ab initio methods.
Conclusion	AM1 describes the relative intensity and the intensity change upon cluster formation correctly.
Background	DFT methods are well known for their deficiencies in calculating bond energies of weakly bound complexes.64–67
Observation	In the dimer, stretching frequency shifts are relatively small , comparable in size and opposite in sign.
Conclusion	Therefore AM1 can be used to predict spectral changes with increasing cluster size.
Background	In contrast the v100 and v101 bands of the dimer, trimer (considering only the strongest band) and tetramer are red shifted,24,25,27 while the v001 band is again blue shifted.
Background	N2O has three normal modes: v100 (mostly N–O-stretch), v001 (mostly N–N-stretch) and v010 (the doubly degenerate bending vibration).
Observation	Weaker bands at the low frequency side (S in Fig. 5) could be assigned to molecules at the cluster surface, following an earlier vibrational analysis.4,5
Method	All ab initio and most semiempirical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 98 program package.53
Observation	Similarly, PM3 describes the clusters as too weakly bound.
Background	For our purpose of simulating large clusters, it is sufficient if a common scaling factor can be applied to all vibrations, or, at least, to the same type of vibrations, for example stretching vibrations.
Result	However, the energy differences per molecule are rather small and one would not expect a preferential orientation of the surface molecules under the experimental conditions of a supersonic expansion.2–5
Result	Moreover, the reference data for the AM1 parametrization did not include polarizabilities23,63 which are essential for describing dispersion interactions.
Model	Therefore we generated several clusters of the same size with random orientation of the individual N2O molecules and averaged all properties over the different clusters.
Background	Despite the experimental interest there are few theoretical studies on N2O and its clusters.
Background	This effect was experimentally observed in infrared68,69 and Raman35,70 spectra of the crystalline solids and theoretically confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations.46,48,49
Observation	Energies of clusters with n = 13, 19, 43, 55, 79, and 135 molecules were averaged over N = 20, 16, 15, 10, 4, and 3 structures, respectively.
Background	One should keep in mind that the microscopic structure of oligomers and large clusters is different.
Result	Based on the good results obtained for the oligomers we extended our AM1 study to nanometre-sized N2O clusters containing up to 177 molecules per cluster.
Observation	Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the N–O-stretch spectrum as a function of cluster size.
Result	The weaker bands (S) can be attributed to surface molecules, pointing toward or away from the center-of-mass of the cluster or lying parallel to the surface.4,5
Observation	MP2 calculations give the best results for the intermolecular distance and angle.
Result	This is consistent with a sublimation energy of ≈23 kJ mol−1, indicating that AM1 can describe the energetics of large N2O clusters with reasonable accuracy.
Method	The AM1 results are carefully checked against experiment and high-level ab initio methods.
Observation	From experiment we know that the highest frequency band around 2245 cm−1 (C) belongs to the cluster core and grows with increasing cluster size, but even under conditions favoring the formation of larger clusters C is less prominent than in the case of the N–O-band and we would not expect a similar prominent peak like in Fig. 5.
Conclusion	However, this does not justify corresponding applications to other related systems: for example, AM1 fails to describe the vibrational frequency shifts of CO251 and is thus not suited for studying the properties of larger CO2 clusters.
Result	Overall MP2 and AM1 best describe the geometric properties of small N2O clusters.
Result	The systematic analysis lays the footing for discussing the results on the dimer, trimer, and tetramer.
Result	In section 4, the AM1 calculations are extended to nanometre-sized clusters containing up to 177 molecules per cluster and compared with experimental and theoretical results obtained earlier4,5.
Result	This effect may become even more pronounced for larger basis sets.
Observation	However, AM1 and PM3 give comparable scaling factors for the two stretch fundamentals.
Observation	With increasing cluster size the dissociation energy per molecule (D0/n) converges to a limit of about 20 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 3).
Result	A careful inspection is even more important for systems not included in the parametrization and effects that have only little influence on the physical properties of the reference systems.
Background	Only recently Signorell demonstrated the applicability of the exciton model to clusters with spatial dimensions between 1 and 10 nm,51 though it was noted that the vibrational band shape of N2O clusters is only in part controlled by resonant dipole–dipole coupling.
Result	AM1 deviates from MNDO only in the explicit formulation of the core repulsion function that allows for a better tuning of the repulsions between atoms at about van der Waals distance.

Conclusion	For example, the location of the C2 structure of the naphthalene dimer was missed by several MP2-based geometry optimisation studies, presumably because of the low symmetry and the computational demands this creates.
Object	The Wilson–Levy (WL) correlation functional is used together with Hartree–Fock (HF) theory to evaluate interaction energies at intermediate separations (i.e. around equilibrium separation) for several weakly-bonded systems.
Model	Following Hobza and Šponer, the uracil dimer geometry was optimised in this work at the MP2/6-31G** level, and agrees closely with the structural data of Hobza and Šponer.46
Result	However, the disagreement for HeNe is striking – the 6-31G* basis recovering an interaction energy of only −5.5 K. The optimum seperation was increased (to 7.0 a0).
Background	Compared with the HF+WL approach, a much wider range of systems could be treated with the EXXWL functional.
Hypothesis	Specifically, it is conjectured that use of the WL correlation functional, applied self-consistently in conjunction with exact-exchange DFT (e.g. the optimised effective potential, OEP35), denoted here as the EXXWL functional, should have a performance similar to the HF+WL approach.
Hypothesis	It also, by design, should work well with Hartree–Fock densities.
Background	The pyrimidine system has been best characterised, at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ(+f functions and bond functions) level of theory,45 but only at one geometry (see Fig. 4) with the vertical separation fixed to 3.3 Å.
Background	Such interactions are ubiquitous in Nature, and should be described properly by any theory that claims to model ‘biological systems’.
Method	For example, even with use of large basis sets, MP2 can substantially overestimate the attraction in weakly-bound aromatic systems.3
Background	On the basis of Heitler–London calculations, Cybulski and Seversen13 correctly identified that the correlation functionals used in their study only showed binding when it was due to exchange effects from the correlation functional, such that the total intermolecular exchange was negative (for their decomposition scheme).
Experiment	At first the 6-31G* basis was used.
Object	The example systems selected in this work examine aromatic ring interactions.
Model	In all cases, a range of basis sets, chosen from 6-31G*, 6-31G*(0.25),40 6-311G*, 6-31 + G* and the aug-cc-pVXZ41–43 {X = D, T, Q, 5} family were used.
Background	Work is currently underway to enable calculations with the EXXWL functional in future.
Method	Several groups have made progress in the development of ‘seamless DFT’ approaches that can describe dispersion contributions at all separations10–12 (including in the overlapping regime).
Result	For each basis the separation between atoms was optimised, but in most cases did not change appreciably for the different basis sets.
Object	The basis set dependence of the HF+WL energies was examined.
Object	The interaction energy as a function of centre-of-mass separation was also investigated for these two functionals.
Experiment	The integration was done over a pruned grid with 99 radial shells and 590 angular points per shell.
Conclusion	The HF+WL/6-31G* level was demonstrated to be insufficient in several instances.
Conclusion	Another example is the geometry optimisation of small molecules adsorbed onto periodic substrates.
Background	While some studies have reported progress in this area,18,19 further studies into damping are probably warranted.
Experiment	For a given arrangement of rigid monomers, the HF wavefunction was converged and the total electronic energy (EHF) obtained, for both the complex, and also for each monomer in the complex.
Method	This fact will not be disputed here; lack of London dispersion remains a major limitation of all approaches that involve Kohn–Sham DFT in some way.
Object	The basis set dependence of the HF+WL approach was also tested for the naphthalene dimer.
Background	The performance of WL correlation for covalent bonds has not been as extensively tested.
Conclusion	This behaviour is reasonable in the sense that the correlation potential should decay faster than the exchange potential (in the case of the HF potential, the asymptotic decay goes like −1/r).
Model	For the benzene dimer, three geometries were considered: a T-shaped structure (C2v symmetry), a slipped-parallel (SP) structure (C2h symmetry) and an undisplaced parallel (F) structure (D6h symmetry), also shown in Fig. 2.
Background	This is opposed to the benzene dimer where the low-energy structures have favourable electrostatic interactions.
Experiment	The interaction energy for each system was also calculated for separations beyond the minimum-energy point.
Hypothesis	The stabilisation of stacked base-pairs is thought to arise from van der Waals interactions.57
Experiment	This separation was varied along the vector connecting the centre of mass points in the same way.
Method	This is in common with many exchange functionals that analogously comprise the Dirac (local) exchange, multiplied by another functional that contains gradient correction terms.
Observation	Separations and interaction energies for these three structures, calculated using the HF+WL method, as well as the X3LYP and xPBE functionals, are shown in Table 2, along with the ab initio data of Tsuzuki et al.49
Background	Methods based on exact exchange, such as the optimised effective potential (OEP),35 the KLI approximation,59 and more recently, the localised HF approach60 and the direct optimisation method,61 will also ensure that the intermolecular exchange behaves as HF exchange.
Method	Functionals of a form such as this lend themselves easily to an analysis in the low-density/high-density-gradient regime, since one can construct an ‘enhancement factor’ (the function that is multiplied by the local component of the functional).
Conclusion	The first is that for all the systems studied here, the monomers were treated as rigid body fragments.
Observation	The F structure was unbound at all separations up to and including 6.0 Å at both the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ and X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ levels.
Method	WL was parametrised from high-quality quantum chemical data for a small number of atoms.
Result	Examination of these data plus the data of Pérez-Jordá et al26. show that, with the exception of dimers containing helium, the HF+WL underestimates the interaction energy.
Conclusion	These results re-emphasise that weak interactions for non-overlapping fragments cannot be captured by the HF+WL approach.
Conclusion	It is clear from all of the test cases examined that the HF+WL approach is capable of recovering qualitative trends in interaction energies for pure van der Waals (dispersion and repulsion) systems, albeit with shorter equilibrium distances (most of the time).
Conclusion	It is also clear that the current group of exchange–correlation functionals, B3LYP, PBE, X3LYP and xPBE, cannot be reliably used even for qualitative work.
Object	These systems were also investigated using the xPBE and X3LYP functionals, both with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.
Method	However, it is now well-known that no mainstream, practical correlation functional can recover the r−6 dependence of London dispersion at large fragment separations (see for example refs. 7 and 25, and references therein).
Experiment	The monomer wavefunctions and energies were obtained in the full set of dimer basis functions, such that the interaction energies were corrected for basis-set superposition error (BSSE) via the counterpoise correction39 (CP).
Background	Tsuzuki et al. did not examine the C2 structure, so we have made comparisons with the trend from the HF+D results of Gonzalez and Lim.24
Result	In agreement with the previous findings of Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 the trend of the well depths presented here are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental results, while not being quantitatively accurate.
Object	The naphthalene dimer presents a significant challenge in the calculation of competitive low-energy structures.
Experiment	The interaction energy was calculated using the supermolecule method, in the following way:The performance of two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP36 and xPBE,37 was also investigated here, in the case of the molecular dimers.
Method	However, all of these approaches are at present too computationally intensive to be applied to large and/or complex weakly-bonded systems.
Result	The minimum energy separation is consistently underestimated by not more than 0.5 a0, as is also demonstrated in the results of Pérez-Jordá et al. The HF+WL approach has not captured the slight contraction in separation in going from KrHe to KrNe.
Method	These methods may yield unreliable results for such small basis sets.
Method	However, the results of these studies do not show transferability of the scaling factor across different systems.
Method	Unfortunately, the WL functional is not multiplicatively separable in this sense from the W38 functional.
Background	However, these systems should only be studied within a fully self-consistent implementation of the EXXWL functional.
Observation	At this level, all structures are bound, with F, T and SP structures having interaction energies −0.20, −3.08 and −2.58 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Conclusion	The utility of HF+WL, with reference to exact-exchange (EXX) density-functional theory, is discussed in terms of a suggested EXXWL exchange–correlation functional.
Experiment	The vertical separation (for the fixed optimum twist angle) was then optimised for this structure using HF+WL.
Result	The range of xPBE interaction energies is significantly compressedwith respect to the MP3 data.
Result	The optimum twist angle was identified at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, for a fixed vertical separation of 3.4 Å.
Observation	The results are summarised in Table 6.
Method	The performance of HF theory for second-order contributions is less comprehensive.
Model	Therefore, in this article, the general phrase ‘dispersion energy’ does not solely refer to the London dispersion (with r−6 dependence) that characterises the long-range contribution, rather, it refers to the dispersion interaction at all separations.
Background	It is worth mentioning that even W38 (without gradient corrections) in partnership with Becke8834 exchange (the B-W functional)66 has been shown to perform comparably with BLYP, although the reasons for this also remain unclear.
Observation	While the T and SP structures remained bound (interaction energies of −2.83 kcal mol−1 and −1.85 kcal mol−1, respectively), the F structure is unbound at this level of theory, at +0.78 kcal mol−1.
Background	It appears that, at present, the lowest-energy structure corresponds to a crossed C2 geometry, with a slipped Ci structure also energetically competitive.44
Experiment	The WL correlation energy (Ecorr) was then extracted from the calculation for both the complex and individual monomers (again using the CP correction).
Method	The use of HF implies that, for a given density, the exchange contribution will be exact (by definition), including under low-density/high-density-gradient conditions.
Background	Since the WL correlation functional was designed for use with HF densities, it may be an appropriate approximate correlation functional to use with exact exchange methods, at least for studying pure van der Waals interactions.
Model	Finally, for the base-pair stacking dimers, the geometries were taken from Hobza and Šponer.45
Background	Several studies have reported low-energy structures of the naphthalene dimer using MP2 calculations with a range of basis sets,44,52,54,55 including correlation corrections to MP2 interaction energies, using CCSD(T) calculations.52
Observation	The optimum interaction energies and centre-of-mass separations are summarised in Table 5, with the MP2 (CCSD(T)-corrected) data of Tsuzuki et al52. presented for comparison, along with the HF+D data of Gonzalez and Lim.24
Observation	The minimum energy separations and interaction energies for these four systems, calculated at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, are reported in Table 6, as are ab initio data obtained by Hobza and Šponer.45
Result	Again, it can be seen that the HF+WL separations are underestimated compared with the best estimate data.
Background	Moreover, this study also showed that in all cases where binding was found, the interaction energy curve decayed to zero faster than r−6, clearly not capturing any long-range dispersion contribution (as expected).
Background	Their data indicate that, compared with other correlation functionals used with B88, WL underestimates covalent bond lengths.
Background	The WL correlation functional is based on the Wigner correlation functional30 (W38), contains gradient corrections, and includes four empirically-determined parameters.
Result	The performance was very similar at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Conclusion	The HF+WL approach provides a reasonable estimate of the energetic and structural trends of this system (while not being quantitatively accurate), where full DFT can not.
Method	Hartree–Fock (HF) theory adequately captures (at small and large separations) first-order contributions such as the electrostatic interaction and the exchange–repulsion interaction.
Conclusion	To quantify the conditions under which this approach appears to be of value it is noted that, for example, in the case of the rare gas dimers, the HF+WL approach yields reasonable results for systems with overlaps no smaller than around 10−5 (with the exception of the helium dimer).
Background	This HF+DFT approach is not the same as Hartree–Fock Kohn–Sham (HFKS) theory, but Pérez-Jordá et al26. reported that the HF+DFT results for rare-gas dimers were almost identical to the HFKS results.
Conclusion	It seems clear that the energy has converged by the aug-cc-pVTZ basis, and that the aug-cc-pVDZ basis still follows a reasonable qualitative trend (especially when compared with the PBE and PW91 data), although the trend for HeKr and NeKr is not captured.
Method	The EXXWL functional would open up possibilities for qualitatively accurate calculations on complex systems not yet accessible by other methodologies, e.g. physisorption onto nanotubes, gas–surface interactions, etc.
Experiment	Both of these functionals were coded into GAUSSIAN98, and satisfactorily verified against the published data for He2,36,37 Ne236,37 and Ar237 systems.
Experiment	The HF+WL interaction energy was calculated as a function of separation in all cases, and the minimum interaction energy was reported in each case.
Result	The similarity between the PBE and PW91 results is also noted.
Conclusion	In contrast, the X3LYP and xPBE data seem less reliable here.
Background	Accurate calculation of these second-order contributions, at any separation, for large and/or complex weakly-interacting systems remains a challenging prospect in theoretical chemistry.
Conclusion	The fully self-consistent EXXWL functional would allow treatment of systems where a general HF+D approach currently fails (such as the NaAr complex, molecular physisorption on metal surfaces, etc)., where the HF wavefunction cannot distort if dynamic correlation effects are not accounted for.
Conclusion	Other functionals, including those that are claimed to describe weak interactions such as xPBE and X3LYP, while also not capable of recovering London dispersion, cannot reliably perform the role of a pragmatic device, even when monomer charge distributions overlap.
Method	One issue to note with both HF+D and DFT+D is that these methods require good quality dispersion coefficients.
Result	The HF+WL/6-31+G* also yields reasonable results for the low-energy structures, giving interaction energies of −5.83, −4.14, −5.75 and −4.86 kcal mol−1 for the C2, D2d, Ci and C2h structures respectively.
Background	Furthermore, they noted that, as expected, this intermolecular exchange contribution vanishes faster with respect to separation than r−6.
Result	For all systems but KrNe, the smaller basis set performed no worse than the aug-cc-pV5Z basis, in terms of capturing the correct trend.
Method	As an alternative to post-HF theories and also DFT+D, another route to gaining economical (and reasonable) estimates of the interaction energy for large weakly-bound systems is to use a Hartree–Fock (HF) plus dispersion approach (HF+D).
Conclusion	Neither can be said to describe rare-gas equilibrium interaction energies satisfactorily, while the HF+WL equilibrium interaction energies follow the trend of the Ogilvie and Wang data relatively closely.
Experiment	The aug-cc-pVTZ basis was used here for HF+WL, X3LYP and xPBE.
Goal	Having accepted the caveats of HF+WL, the utility of this approach as a pragmatic device for locating low-energy structures of large van der Waals systems (some of which have low symmetry) in a simple and quick way will be demonstrated.
Background	Therefore, the fact that mainstream DFT cannot recover short-range second-order contributions must be due, in part, to problems with the exchange functional.
Method	Although HF theory can yield a reasonable estimate of the induction contribution, HF theory cannot recover the dispersion energy.
Method	As in the HF+D approach, the exchange contribution should behave correctly at long range.
Result	Also shown in Table 4 for comparison are results from full DFT calculations, as reported by Tsuzuki and Lüthi51 and also from current work, that confirm the unsuitability of these functionals as applied to weakly-bound systems.
Result	At this level of theory, the D2h was not bound for any separation.
Background	As noted by Wilson and Levy,27 since the traditional quantum chemistry definition of correlation energy is not always equivalent to the DFT definition, the WL functional may not be successful if applied to systems where the HF density is substantially different to the true density of the system.
Model	The four low-energy structures are shown in Fig. 3.
Conclusion	These calculations confirmed what has been reported previously by Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 namely that the interaction energy decays to zero too rapidly compared with the r−6 decay observed with long-range London dispersion interactions.
Background	Finally, it is plausible that the WL functional yields unphysical attractive contributions for some of the short-ranged contributions to the interaction energy.
Background	The HF+WL method should essentially be regarded as an empirical correction to the HF interaction energy, and presumably has inherent deficiencies with the description of intermolecular exchange.
Result	Two newly-developed exchange–correlation functionals, designed for applications to biological systems (X3LYP and xPBE), were also investigated and found to perform not as well as the HF+WL approach.
Result	It is interesting to note that the lowest-energy separation for pyrimidine is larger than the separation estimated by Hobza and Šponer.
Background	The interaction energy between two weakly-interacting fragments comprises many distinct and well-understood (although perhaps not easy to calculate) contributions.
Experiment	At the minimum-energy separations found at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, the interaction energies were recalculated using the 6-31G* basis set.
Background	Following Stone,1 the interaction energy can be decomposed into first-order, second-order and higher-order contributions.
Object	This was done to confirm the dependence of the interaction energy on overlap, for short- to medium-range separations.
Method	Finally, it must be emphasised that, as demonstrated by Pérez-Jordá et al.,26 the HF+WL method has no pretensions to capturing London dispersion (the long-range contribution).
Background	However, it has been remarked by others64 that perhaps a more realistic asymptotic behaviour of the correlation potential would be −α/r4, where α is the polarizability.
Experiment	Optimised naphthalene dimer geometries were taken from previous work.44
Result	This behaviour in stark contrast with the behaviour noted for the D2h isomer of the naphthalene dimer, and the F structure of the benzene dimer, both of which were unbound at the HF+WL/6-31G* level.
Object	The Wilson–Levy (WL) correlation functional was used as a post-Hartree–Fock (HF) perturbative correction in the evaluation of the interaction energy for a range of weakly-bound dimers, in the regime of small to intermediate fragment separations.
Method	Empirical scaling of DFT exchange has also been examined by several groups,14,16,17 with a view to correcting this problem.
Model	Unless otherwise stated, the monomer structures were fully optimised at the MP2/6-31G** level of theory.
Object	The final test system comprises the base-stacking interaction for dimers of pyrimidine, cytosine, uracil and guanine.
Method	However, many studies have amply demonstrated that application of DFT to weakly-bound systems can not yield globally reliable estimates of the interaction energy even at intermediate intermonomer separations5–9 where there is overlap between fragments.
Background	Such an EXXWL functional is not intended to act as a replacement for more accurate post-HF methods, but rather as a device for optimising the structure and energetics of weakly-bonded systems that are not amenable even to MP2 optimisations.
Result	The trend in energetics for the D2d, Ci and C2h structures agrees with the best estimates, although there is not quantitative agreement.
Conclusion	It is similar to other correlation potentials, e.g. the Perdew(86)63 correlation functional, in the sense that the potential decays to the asymptotic limit exponentially.
Result	The interaction energies, although overestimated for the T and SP structures, still show a reasonable trend compared with the F structure, although the T and SP structures are not isoenergetic as suggested in the results of the ab initio calculations.
Background	The parameters were determined via comparison with the exact (calculated) correlation energy (in the traditional quantum chemistry definition) for several atoms (neutral and cationic), plus the experimental correlation energy of the helium atom.
Background	Despite these well-known deficiencies of DFT, a number of schemes for empirically correcting DFT calculations by addition of damped dispersion (DFT+D) have been proposed.6,18–20
Method	In general, all HF + dispersion methods are subject to this condition, which does limit the applicability of this type of approach.
Observation	The interaction energies of these rare-gas systems, calculated using HF+WL for a range of basis sets aug-cc-pVXZ {X = D, T, Q, 5} is shown in Fig. 5.
Method	The WL correlation functional is based on the local Wigner correlation functional30 (W38).
Background	The ab initio data of Hobza and Šponer are the best estimates (obtained using an extrapolation procedure involving MP2 complete basis set data with CCSD(T) corrections) available at present.
Model	For the methane dimer, three different relative orientations were examined, as shown in Fig. 2.
Result	All other separations obtained using the HF+WL approach are, as expected, underestimated.
Background	It has been recently suggested that both of these functionals should adequately describe non-bonded interactions for systems involving the first ten elements in the periodic table36,37.
Conclusion	These data demonstrate that the HF+WL approach captures the binding trends for these three structures, for all basis sets considered, while clearly not displaying quantitative accuracy.
Background	Gonzalez and Lim24 report a HF + disp interaction energy of the T structure (at the geometry used by Tsuzuki et al50). of −2.80 kcal mol−1, albeit with a rather modest basis for the HF component.
Experiment	All calculations in this work were done using GAUSSIAN.9838
Background	Some other correlation functionals also showed binding, but did not recover qualitatively correct equilibrium binding energies.
Result	The D2h was checked instead using both the 6-31+G* and 6-311G* basis sets, with both yielding binding, optimised at −1.07 kcal mol−1 and −1.80 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Background	Low-symmetry structures can be very time-consuming to optimise at any post-HF level (with a sufficiently large basis set), although advances are being made in this area (e.g. see .ref. 4)
Object	The basis set dependency was again explored by repeating these calculations at the HF+WL/6-31G* level.
Background	Because of the constraints imposed by the HF+D-like approach used here, the systems chosen for study should have HF densities that are reasonably close to the true density.
Conclusion	These results, as well as those summarised in Table 4, demonstrate that the recovery of binding for molecular complexes, even at separations where the fragments overlap, remains an elusive goal for mainstream DFT exchange–correlation functionals.
Background	Full CCSD(T) calculations with any reasonable basis set are currently out of reach, at least for the low symmetry structures.
Object	Here, the HF+WL approach is applied to all homoatomic and heteroatomic rare-gas dimers RgKr {Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr}, the methane dimer, benzene dimer, naphthalene dimer and also DNA base-pair stacking interactions.
Conclusion	It was found that this HF+WL approach works well in a pragmatic and qualitative sense for the energetics of closed-shell van der Waals systems, but without a satisfying physical justification, and without quantitative accuracy.
Model	Using this MP2 structure, the separation (along the vector connecting the centre of mass of each molecule) was optimised using HF+WL, while keeping the angle of the monomer normal vectors (normal to the ring plane) constant.
Method	Density-functional theory (DFT) is often proposed as a means of obtaining the correlation contribution to the total electronic energy, in a way that is computationally economical.
Result	In particular, the best estimates indicate that the D2d and C2h structures are almost isoenergetic, while the HF+WL data support a difference of over 0.5 kcal mol−1.
Experiment	The correlation energy was then evaluated using the corresponding HF density.
Model	The geometries of these systems are shown in Fig. 4.
Conclusion	The performance of all of the functionals examined here is poor in comparison with the HF+WL approach.
Method	Some comments on the choice of example systems studied here are warranted.
Result	It is seen in Table 5 that the HF+WL separations all seem reasonable when compared with the ab initio data, although are consistently too short.
Background	Most published theoretical studies of the naphthalene dimer have made use of MP2 calculations.44,52,54–56
Object	It is the applicability of this approach as a pragmatic device that will be further explored in this work.
Method	The LYP functional comprises a (local) W38 component multiplied by another functional that contains gradient correction terms.
Result	The T structure was bound at a separation of 5.7 Å at the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ level, with an optimum interaction energy of −0.48 kcal mol−1.
Motivation	In other words, for the naphthalene dimer, fortuitous location of the low-energy structures, by virtue of attractive electrostatic interactions, is not possible, making this system an excellent test case for new functionals.
Object	Exact exchange and Wilson–Levy correlation: a pragmatic device for studying complex weakly-bonded systems
Object	Here, four low-energy structures (Fig. 3) and one high-energy structure are considered.
Result	This result confirms the behaviour of the HF+WL/6-31G* level as noted for the benzene dimer calculations.
Method	In the worst case, the use of post-HF methods such as MP2 or CCSD(T) can be limited at best to rather modest basis set sizes.
Method	This HF+DFT approach was shown by Pérez-Jordá etal26. to work very well for selected rare-gas dimers in the case where the Wilson–Levy correlation functional (WL)27 was used.
Background	Chermette et al33. reported self-consistent KS-DFT optimisations of the CO and N2O molecules, using the B88 exchange functional34 with WL correlation.
Object	Furthermore, since the HF+WL method used here is an ad hoc post-Hartree–Fock correction (and not variationally obtained), this will cause further problems when seeking monotonically decreasing behaviour of interaction energies as a function of basis-set size.
Background	While it is often the correlation functional which is identified as deficient in recovering second-order contributions in the overlapping regime, several studies have instead identified the exchange functional as problematic,6,8,13–16 especially under the conditions of low-density/high-density-gradient.
Hypothesis	A HF+WL-type of approach may be extremely useful for optimising geometries of low-symmetry structures.
Background	These systems have been the subject of studies using MP2,45 CCSD(T),45 empirically-corrected DFT16,18,58 and HF+D calculations.58
Result	This behaviour is similar to that noted for other popular functionals.53
Conclusion	Clearly the HF+WL approach is not perfect here – but it is outperforming other DFT-based approaches.
Background	Calculations at the MP2 level tend to overestimate the attraction in the naphthalene dimer, most significantly for the structures lowest in energy.52
Model	That is, antiparallel undisplaced structures were used for the pyrimidine and cytosine dimers, and the vertical displacement was optimised using HF+WL.
Object	Three structures of the methane dimer were studied, as shown in Fig. 2; one D3d structure and two D3h structures.
Conclusion	However, these data also suggest that failure to recover long-range London dispersion does not preclude a DFT-based methodology from recovering binding at distances where fragments do overlap.
Model	Compared with pyrimidine and cytosine, the procedure for creating the input structures for uracil and guanine was a little different.
Result	The HF+WL approach reproduces binding trends for all complexes studied: selected rare-gas dimers, isomers of the methane dimer, benzene dimer and naphthalene dimer, and base-pair stacking structures for pyrimidine, cytosine, uracil and guanine dimers.
Observation	The interaction energies are also plotted in Fig. 1.
Result	The X3LYP values showed a similar trend, with absolute interaction energies slightly higher in all cases.
Observation	The only structure that yielded an interaction energy of less than +1 (but greater than zero) kcal mol−1, for either xPBE or X3LYP, was for the case when the distance along the vector connecting the two centre of mass points was extended by 0.2 Å.
Conclusion	Of course, there is no way that the WL correlation functional can provide a realistic description of London dispersion interactions at long range.
Experiment	In this case, the HF+WL interaction energies were calculated as a function of separation (along the vector that connects centre of mass points), while the relative orientations of each dimer structure were kept fixed.
Conclusion	In agreement with their findings, and with previous MP2 optimisations,44 the HF+WL approach also supports the C2 structure as the putative global minimum for the naphthalene dimer system.
Method	The LYP correlation functional,65 due to its basis on the Colle–Salvetti formula, is also based on the form of the W38 functional.
Conclusion	This confirms the necessity for using at least split-valence plus diffuse functions in the basis set when using HF+WL.
Background	Second-order contributions to the interaction energy arise from electronic correlation effects (beyond electron exchange alone).
Model	It is noted that, in general, any perturbative correction to the HF interaction energy should only hold under conditions such that the HF wavefunction will not substantially distort if (some) second-order effects are dynamically included.
Background	This approach will herein be referred to as HF+WL.
Background	Application of DFT to this system is also particularly unsuitable: the high-energy structures have attractive electrostatic energy contributions and relatively small dispersion contributions, and the low-energy structures have electrostatic contributions that are less favourable, while having relatively large dispersion contributions.44,52
Object	Isomers A and G are other low-energy structures, and therefore these two geometries probe the interaction energy in regions of configuration space away from the global minimum.
Hypothesis	However, it appears possible that the HF+WL method can be extended such that all types of non-bonded system could be treated in future.
Background	Two clear limitations of these current calculations are acknowledged.
Observation	The interaction energies of pyrimidine, uracil, cytosine and guanine were −3.1, −11.3, −10.3 and −14.0 kcal mol−1, respectively.
Method	Higher-order terms are recovered (with varying degrees of accuracy) via use of post-HF methods such as Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory, MP2, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with triples corrections, CCSD(T).
Conclusion	As shown in Fig. 1, the qualitative agreement found using HF+WL clearly exceeds the performance of any other mainstream DFT approach (demonstrated, for example, in the results of Patton and Pederson.9)
Experiment	For each low-energy structure, the separations were varied with displacements of ±0.2 Å away (along the vector connecting the centre ofmass points) from the optimum separation (as was determined by MP2/6-31G* geometry optimizations.44)
Background	Therefore, an investigation of systems where there is less similarity between HF and real densities is, at present, desirable.
Conclusion	As will be confirmed with some of the other systems, the overlap obtained using the 6-31G* basis appears insufficient to ensure confident use of HF+WL here.
Result	Every structure was bound for both functionals, although the attraction is decreased in comparison with the data of Hobza and Šponer.
Result	The agreement with the best energetic estimates from Hobza and Šponer is good for all cases.
Result	For each basis set used (6-31G*, 6-31G*(0.25), aug-cc-pVXZ {X = D, T, Q}) the trend of interaction energies (A > G > H) was always followed.
Method	These short-range terms should behave as a function of overlap between fragments.
Object	The D3d structure corresponds with isomer H, and the two D3h structures as isomers A and G, in the nomenclature of Tsuzuki et al.49
Result	Again, the D6h (F) structure provides a probe of the HF+WL method away from the two low-energy structures.
Observation	This appeared to give satisfactory results for the four low-energy structures–yielding −4.77, −3.10, −4.70 and −3.93 kcal mol−1 for the C2, D2d, Ci and C2h structures, respectively.
Conclusion	It must be re-emphasised that, as a general rule, it appears that HF+WL calculations must be used with at least split-valence plus diffuse functions in order to capture qualitative behaviour.
Goal	These HF+WL results will be compared with results obtained using several established mainstream functionals (e.g. B3LYP and PBE), as well as two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP36 and xPBE.37
Observation	For the xPBE functional, at a 6.0 Å separation, interaction energies were 0.19, 0.12, 0.72, 0.06 and 0.23 kcal mol−1 for the D2d, C2, C2h, Ci and D2h structures, respectively.
Method	However, this caveat does not necessarily exclude the HF+WL method yielding binding when there is overlap between fragments, crucially, around the equilibrium separation for many weakly-interacting systems.
Background	The decomposition analysis used by Cybulski and Seversen, while helpfully demonstrating the overlap effect of binding for some correlation functionals, does not explain why these correlation functionals yield negative contributions to the intermolecular exchange.
Model	Therefore, the method has been tested on systems where dynamic inclusion of such effects would not substantially distort the wavefunction, compared with the HF wavefunction.
Method	Also, the form of the damping function, including anisotropic damping, can be a very important factor in gaining good results from these DFT+D models.
Object	The interaction energy as calculated here by the supermolecule method is of course not variational, so we do not necessarily expect to see convergence of this energy from above.
Observation	For both of these functionals, none of the five structures were bound, out to a centre-of-mass separation of 6.0 Å.
Experiment	The quadrature used here ensured that the correlation energy was converged to within 1–2 μEh per atom (depending on atom type).
Result	None of these locally-perturbed structures showed binding at the xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Object	The X3LYP and xPBE functionals were also tested for all five naphthalene dimer structures.
Model	Systems exhibiting pure van der Waals interactions (dispersion and repulsion) are ideal in this case, and the systems chosen here reflect this.
Background	Finally, by way of comparison with other empirically-corrected methods, Wu et al6. report a DFT + disp interaction energy for the SP structure (at the Tsuzuki et al50. geometry) of −3.99 kcal mol−1.
Result	The trend in the interaction energies is reproduced, although the absolute values appear fortuitously close to the best estimates.
Method	However, recent progress in the development of algorithms for the rapid evaluation of MP2 energies and gradients (e.g. see Saebø et al4)., should in future enable practical geometry optimisations using larger basis sets.
Conclusion	Furthermore, these conclusions only hold at separations where the charge distribution on each fragment overlaps.
Conclusion	Relative orientations seemed to be captured well for the HF+WL approach.
Conclusion	Thus, while admittedly not having a satisfying and physically rigorous theoretical justification, the HF+WL approach (or in future, the EXXWL functional) may become a useful pragmatic device for optimising the geometries of large and/or complicated van der Waals complexes that are currently beyond the reach of optimisation by more sophisticated ab initio methods.
Observation	Increasing flexibility by using a triple split valence basis, in this case using 6-311G*, leads to binding of the F structure (−0.53 kcal mol−1).
Observation	The corresponding optimised separations at the HF+WL/6-31G* level were 3.4, 2.97, 3.1 and 3.0 Å, respectively.
Result	Also in contrast with the rare-gas systems, the isomers studied here showed little sensitivity to changes in basis set using the HF+WL approach.
Background	This result has also been reported by Gonzalez and Lim, using a HF+D approach.24
Method	Both induction and dispersion are present in the regime of large fragment separations (the ‘long-range’ form) where the charge distributions on each fragment do not overlap, and are also present in the small to intermediate separation regime (the ‘short-range’ form) where the charge distributions do overlap.
Observation	At the HF+WL/6-311G* level, the T and SP structures also remained with reasonable interaction energies (−3.16 and −2.84 kcal mol−1, respectively).
Result	X3LYP is seen to perform similarly to xPBE for these systems.
Object	These HF+WL data are contrasted against results obtained from some popular functionals (including B3LYP and PBE), as well as two newly-developed functionals, X3LYP and xPBE.
Experiment	Again, the vertical separation between monomers was optimised to yield the optimum interaction energy in each case.
Conclusion	Even if the origins of this unphysical behaviour can be revealed, further work is required to understand why these (potentially) unphysical terms combine such that very good interaction energies are ultimately recovered, albeit fortuitously.
Background	Accordingly, with the exception of LDA, most functionals will incorrectly predict that the T structures (T1 and T2 as shown in ref. 44) are the lowest in energy (no isomers are bound using PW91 and B3LYP).53
Background	In particular, these authors demonstrated that the Wilson–Levy correlation functional (WL)27 worked extremely well in partnership with HF theory, in reproducing the experimental well-depths of the rare-gas dimer systems studied “with remarkable agreement”.
Background	In this by work of Hobza and Šponer,45 the vertical separation of cytosine and guanine dimers were fixed at 3.3 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively, and the uracil dimer geometry came from geometry optimisation at the MP2/6-31G** level.
Background	A decomposition scheme based on Heitler–London type calculations, as reported by Cybulski and Seversen,13 may be helpful in this instance.
Observation	The calculated well-depths and minimum energy separations, obtained using the aug-cc-pV5Z basis, for Kr2, HeKr, NeKr and ArKr are presented in Table 1, along with reference values from Ogilvie and Wang,47,48 and other DFT values from Patton and Pederson.9
Object	The SP structure was investigated in the neighbourhood of the structure of Tsuzuki et al., such that the vertical and horizontal separations, as well as the distance along the vector connecting the two centre of mass points, was varied by displacements of ±0.2 Å.
Background	However, the utility of this functional has principally been demonstrated only as a post-HF correction8,31,32 for atoms and molecules, not as a dynamic correlation contribution that is self-consistently evaluated.
Observation	Exploration of the interaction energy of the F structure at a range of separations confirmed that this structure remained unbound.
Observation	The minimum energy separations and interaction energies for the three benzene dimer structures, calculated at the HF+WL/aug-cc-pVDZ level, are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
Conclusion	However, no claim is made to suggest that the HF+WL approach can describe a pure van der Waals system with quantitative accuracy, and therefore is not competitive with post-Hartree–Fock methodologies.
Method	Where charge distributions overlap, second-order contributions are modified by general overlap effects as well as electron exchange, leading to damped induction, exchange-induction, damped dispersion and exchange–dispersion contributions.
Conclusion	The HF+WL approach cannot be successfully applied in the large separation regime.
Conclusion	These data suggest that a basis with at least split valence plus diffuse and polarization functions, or triple split valence plus polarization should be used to obtain qualitatively correct HF+WL interaction energies.
Background	Their data, shown in Fig. 1, emphatically reinforces their statement.
Result	Furthermore, the separation corresponding to the optimum interaction energy is increased relative to the results from Hobza and Šponer. xPBE manages to capture the trend of the interaction energies, although as already observed for the methane dimer, the range of interaction energies is considerably smaller than is seen in the ab initio results.
Model	The monomers were treated as rigid bodies throughout.
Conclusion	The results of HF+WL optimisations would at least indicate which of the structures should be considered for further refinement by more expensive post-HF methods.
Background	For the remaining systems (fixed at the geometries in Fig. 4) examined by Hobza and Šponer, uracil was characterised up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(+ bond functions) level, cytosine up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ leveland guanine up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level.
Conclusion	For these functionals, of those structures that showed any binding at all, the binding was substantially underestimated compared with best estimates from ab initio calculations.
Experiment	Similarly, diffuse functions were added to the 6-31G* basis, such that the 6-31+G* basis set was considered.
Object	The basis set dependence of the the HF+WL approach was also gauged for the benzene dimer structures.
Model	For the naphthalene dimer, four low-energy structures and one high-energy structure were examined: two crossed structures (D2d and C2 symmetries) and two slipped-parallel structures (C2h and Ci symmetries), and one undisplaced parallel structure (D2h).
Result	The PW91 data fortuitously coincides with the HeKr and NeKr points, while the PBE data fortuitously coincides with the ArKr and Kr2 points.
Background	This overlap effect has been observed (but not quantified) by others, e.g. see .ref. 7
Result	Table 4 shows the interaction energy of the T, F and SP structures calculated at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and xPBE/aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory, at the geometries taken from Tsuzuki et al.,50 revealing a similar performance of these two functionals compared with existing functionals.
Conclusion	It is clear that neither of these functionals can reliably yield binding for aromatic ring interactions at a qualitative level.
Conclusion	However, the intramolecular degrees of freedom could in principle be optimised using the HF+WL approach.
Background	These data were obtained using their extrapolation method where the interaction energy is calculated at the MP2 basis set limit plus a CCSD(T) correction evaluated with a large basis set.
Background	Both of these ‘+dispersion’ approaches may succeed for the long-range part of the dispersion interaction, but it is not entirely clear that the DFT+D approach is correct in the overlapping regime.25
Background	For comparison, the data of Tsuzuki et al50. are shown.
Conclusion	Fig. 1 also re-emphasises the point made by others that the PW91 and PBE functionals do not show great variation in energy between each rare-gas dimer system.
Result	The X3LYP data show binding only for structure A. Out to a separation of 6 Å, the other two structures were not bound using the X3LYP functional.
Result	Similarly, at the X3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level, the T structure was bound at an optimum distance of 5.6 Å with an interaction energy of −0.37 kcal mol−1.
Experiment	For the high-energy D2h structure, the optimum separation was taken from Tsuzuki et al.52
Method	The HF+D approach was first introduced by Hepburn etal.,21 has been successfully applied to small weakly-bound systems,22 and recently Lim and coworkers have applied HF+D to small clusters of polyaromatic heterocycles to good effect.23,24
Conclusion	The results of this work suggest an apparently promising device in the form of the EXXWL functional, for determining the energetic trends of molecules physisorbed on surfaces, nanotubes and other periodic structures.
Result	Although the xPBE data show binding for each structure, and also that the trend of the interaction energies seems correct (A > G > H), the binding is reduced compared with the MP3 results (except in the case of isomer A).
Result	The F structure is bound in the HF+WL model, but underestimates the attraction, again emphasising that the HF+WL method cannot compete with post-HF approaches.
Background	Wilson and Levy point out that, due to the way in which the functional was parametrised, it may not perform well for systems where the Hartree–Fock density differs substantially from the true density.
Background	The reader is directed to the body of work concerned with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), where such contributions to the interaction energy are rigorously defined (e.g., the review article of Jeziorski et al2)..
Conclusion	The second limitation is on the type of system that can be studied with this method (the same restrictions apply to HF+D methods), and is a consequence of how the correlation contribution forms a perturbative correction to the total Hartree–Fock energy.
Background	Furthermore, promising developments of inclusion of ‘left–right’ correlation with exact exchange within the KS-DFT framework62 suggest that an approach that combines non-dynamical correlation with the EXXWL functional may in future permit reasonable modelling of bond-breaking in weakly-bonded systems.
Background	In addition, several correlation functionals did not yield any attractive contributions, notably the VWN28 and Perdew–Wang29 correlation functionals.
Background	Periodic EXX calculations are now possible via some mainstream plane-wave codes, making EXXWL presumably more efficient than currently available periodic MP2 implementations (as found in GAUSSIAN03).
Result	Again, the HF+WL approach underestimates the minimum-energy separation, found to be 4.6, 3.5 and 3.4 Å for the A, G and H structures, respectively.
Conclusion	This limitation could be lifted if the WL correlation could be included dynamically, within Kohn–Sham DFT, via the implementation of exact-exchange methods (denoted here as the proposed EXXWL functional).
Conclusion	The WL correlation potential has been examined, and appears to have unremarkable properties in comparison with other correlation potentials.
Conclusion	The fact that the HF+WL almost always underestimates monomer separations seems consistent with this idea.
Model	The guanine dimer structure was an undisplaced stacked geometry, where one monomer was rotated clockwise about its centre of mass (in the plane of the molecule).
Conclusion	It is also noted that the HF+WL approach appeared to work reliably only when a basis set featuring at least split-valence plus diffuse functions was used.
Object	The D3d structure has been identified by Tsuzuki and coworkers49 as the global minimum structure, at least at the MP3/aug(df,pd)-6-311G** level of theory.
Conclusion	Compelling reasons for why the WL functional works so well in the cases studied here remain unclear.
Method	The problem of calculating the short-range interaction energy can also be approached via the addition of a correlation contribution derived from DFT onto the total HF energy of the system, bearing in mind the deficiencies pointed out by Cybulski and Seversen.13
Background	For comparison, the MP3 separations from Tsuzuki et. al. are 4.8, 3.8 and 3.8 Å for the A, G and H structures, respectively.
Motivation	An accurate description of exchange under such conditions is vital for describing weakly-bonded systems.
Background	Hartree–Fock densities of these atoms were used in the parametrisation of this functional.
Experiment	The basis set dependence was also checked for the smaller 6-31G* basis.
Conclusion	The absolute HF+WL interaction energy for the D2h structure deviates significantly from the ab initio value, although it is bound, and exhibits the smallest interaction energy of the set, in accord with Tsuzuki et al. Again, these data emphasise that HF+WL cannot outperform high-quality post-HF calculations.
Model	The geometries used for the base-pair calculations can be found in Fig. 4.
Method	Since it is difficult to disentangle the W38 functional from the WL functional, the WL functional is therefore not amenable to an analogous analysis of the ‘enhancement factor’.
Result	The results with the 6-31G* basis do not show much difference with the data obtained with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis.

Model	Withone can identify all contributions to the final integral that vanish too slowly, and these terms can be neglected since they cancel in the transformation to spherical harmonics.
Method	The computation of ERIs is typically the dominant step in HF (Hartree–Fock) and DFT (density functional theory) treatments of molecules if the electronic energy is computed exactly within a basis set expansion of molecular orbitals.
Background	Two features are relevant for an implementation of eqn. (20).
Result	(ii) Different from the general case in eqn. (12) each intermediate batch (l0|L) occurs only with a single m value; this reduces storage and computational requirements.
Model	It is more efficient to accumulate (l − 1i)0|L)(1) separately and to add the sum later on.
Method	Multipole moment methodology can also be exploited within RI, thus combining the advantages of both procedures.15
Background	Gains in efficiency resulting from the RI technique are most pronounced for the treatment of J.
Model	Next we exploit that components of |L〉 are (transformed to) spherical harmonics.
Model	The formal O(N4) effort to evaluate (ab|cd), N = number of basis functions, is thus reduced to O(N3).
Observation	The last step typically dominates by far the evaluation of a complete integral batch.
Object	The present paper gives a brief summary of the RI method at first, then treats the evaluation of three-center integrals within the Obara–Saika1 (OS) procedure, and finally presents new vertical recursion relations for spherical harmonics as auxiliary functions.
Observation	For the intermediate integrals, m > 0, one does not need all components of a shell: dx2, dy2, dz2, and dxy suffice to get a complete f shell, and six f components for a g set, etc.
Model	This implies the following asymptotic decay of integrals:(l0|L) ∝ |P − C|−L−1 for |P − C| → ∞.(l0|L) may vanish even faster if l0 does not include a partial wave of s character but this is of no concern for the present considerations.
Result	It should be mentioned that there is an alternative to eqn. (12),16 which is more efficient for four-center integrals, especially for large angular momentum functions.
Model	For each L one has only a single m value and this index can simply be implied with corresponding savings in memory and overhead necessary to implement eqn. (20).
Result	The evaluation of the interelectronic Coulomb interaction J required (per iteration): 64 s in direct mode (all integrals computed on the fly); 46 s if 660 MB was used to store three-center integrals in memory; and 20 s if the far-field integrals were obtained by multipole moment techniques,15 all timings for a 2.4 GHz Xeon.
Object	We demonstrate simplifications of integral evaluations for the OS scheme since this has been considered and implemented.
Model	We thus can replace the five-term recursion in eqn. (12) by a two-term recursion Since the index m on the lhs is connected only with (m + 1) on the rhs, one starts the recursion with (l0|0)(L), then gets (l0|1)(L−1), etc., until the final integral (l0|L)(0) is reached.
Observation	That the third and fourth term cannot matter can also be seen directly.
Model	In general the easiest way is to first get the necessary (l0|0)(m), eqn. (11), and then to increase L by means of eqn. (12).
Result	The reduction in the index range of m following from eqn. (20) also leads to a reduced index range in the recursion eqn. (11), and eqn. (10) is required only for L ≤ m ≤ (L + la + lb).
Model	An introduction of the RI technique2–7 conveniently starts from the definition〈f|g〉 = ∫ f(r1)r12−1g(r2)dτwhich fulfils all requirements of a scalar product: it is linear and positive definite, since 〈f|f〉 = 0 if and only if f = 0.
Model	The errors introduced by the approximation in eqn. (5) are of no concern if optimized auxiliary functions are employed.
Result	The same reasoning applies for sets of f, g, etc., functions.
Model	Although we consider Cartesian Gaussians, eqn. (7), we will assume that |L〉 is always transformed later on to reduced (real) spherical harmonics comprising 5, 7, 9 components for d, f, g sets.
Method	The evaluation of electron repulsion integrals (ERI) over basis functions a,b,c,d(ab|cd) = ∫ a(r1)b(r1)r12−1c(r2)d(r2)dτis a basic task in molecular electronic structure methods.
Model	ERIs are then simply written as (ab|cd) = 〈ab|cd〉.
Object	We summarize the simplification resulting from the RI technique in comparison to conventional treatments based on (ab|cd).
Result	This advantage is lost for the present case of three-center integrals.
Model	The recursive increase of L can be simplified.
Method	It is shown that the three-center integrals required can be evaluated with a much simpler algorithm than for the general case.
Method	The RI (resolution of the identity) technique is a proven procedure for this purpose.
Background	This is trivial and the corresponding term has only been included to show differences to the general case (ab|cd).
Observation	This implies that the third term on the rhs of eqn. (12) can be neglected since it cancels after transformation.
Result	(iii) The simple form of eqn. (20) greatly facilitates the development of optimized hand-coded routines.
Result	The efficiency of the procedure can be seen from timings of an example at hand, a treatment of Cu40Sb21(PH3)28, symmetry T, with 173 atoms, 1905 contracted GTOs in an SV(P) basis,19 and 5184 (contracted) auxiliary functions.7
Background	The choice of reduced auxiliary functions is not only more aesthetic; it also improves numerical stability.
Model	This can be done explicitly by a transformation step, which is advantageous if integrals have to be transformed into an MO representation as in correlated treatments.
Method	Other procedures have been developed for the very same purpose, such as CFMM (continuous fast multipole moment)12 in combination with the J engine method13 and Fourier techniques.14
Model	From eqns. (10) and (11) one has (l0|0)(0) ∝ |P − C|−1The third term on the rhs of eqn. (12) maintains this asymptotic behavior, which in the final integral, m = 0, would lead to (l0|L) ∝ |P − C|−1 in contradiction to eqn. (17).
Model	The relevant equations and definitions are, if we stay close to the nomenclature of OS (keeping their P, since this can hardly be confused with the auxiliary functions):(00|0)(m) = 2π5/2(ζ + γ)1/2(ζγ)−1e−(αβ/ζ)|A−B|2Fm(x)x = ρ|P − Q|2The true ERI has index m = 0, the recursion then requires m > 0 for intermediate quantities, i.e.m = 0 to (la + lb + L) for the start, eqn. (10).
Background	The above described algorithm, including optimized hand-coded routines for la + lb + L ≤ 4, has been implemented in TURBOMOLE18 and will be included in the next release.
Background	This further increases the advantage of RI procedures.
Model	This offers the advantage that ((l − 1i)0|L)(1) has fewer components than (l0|(L + 1i)).
Method	The RI (resolution of the identity) technique achieves significant increases in efficiency for various molecular electronic structure methods.
Model	If the auxiliaries P, Q are chosen as atom-centered functions one further has to deal with three-centre integrals only, which leads to additional simplifications as will be demonstrated below.
Model	For L = 2, i.e. a set of d functions, these terms give identical contributions ((1/2η)(l0|0)(m) − (ρ/2η2)(l0|0)(m+1)) to the integrals involving Cartesian functions dx2, dy2, dz2, and this cancels if one goes over to dx2−y2 and d3z2−r2.
Conclusion	We note in passing that even larger simplifications can be achieved if only two-center integrals have to be computed17 and the present case lies in between the two-center and four-center cases.
Model	The functions P, Q are usually termed auxiliary or fitting functions, since eqn. (6) implies that ρ is approximated as ρ ≈  = ρ.
Model	For HF or DFT it is easier to ensure simply that contraction coefficients cL of (lalb|L) do not contain components of s type for a d set, or of p type for an f set, etc.
Model	For the final batch, (l0|(L + 1i))(0) , one will not use eqn. (20) directly if integrals over contracted GTOs are computed.
Object	Efficient evaluation of three-center two-electron integrals over Gaussian functions
Motivation	It is thus desirable to develop approximations for eqn. (1) which combine efficiency and accuracy.
Method	This results from the approximation of four-center two-electron integrals by corresponding three-center integrals.
Model	We consider the evaluation of (ab|P) for the usual choice of atom-centered GTOs (Gaussian type orbitals)|la〉 = a(r) = (x − Ax)lx(y − Ay)ly(z − Az)lze−α|r − A|2l = (lx,ly,lz), l = lx + ly + lz.With the shorthand notation a(r) = |la〉 we drop the parameters A and α. b(r) = |lb〉 will be similarly specified by lb, β, B, and the auxiliary function P(r) = |L〉 by L, γ, C, and we write (ab|P) = (lalb|L).It is sufficient to consider (la0|L) since the general case is recovered by the horizontal recursion relation, e.g.
Result	(i) The original five term recursion eqn. (12) is replaced by a two-term recursion eqn. (20).
Background	This has been demonstrated in a series of investigations considering J, the HF exchange K, and correlated treatments based on second order perturbation theory.7–11
Model	Let us now introduce a set of functions labelled P, Q and the projection operator onto this space where MPQ denotes matrix elements of the inverse of 〈P|Q〉. is optimal in the sense is usually called ‘resolution of the identity’; its insertion into eqn. (1) yields the RI approximation for ERIs (using parentheses for two-electron integrals since this is common usage for the charge density notation) We similarly get a concise expression for the Coulomb energy J of a charge distribution ρ(r)which has an error (O||δρ||2) in the sense of eqn. (4).
Observation	The fourth term on the rhs of eqn. (12) has the same structure as the third and cancellation applies here as well.
Model	The first term on the rhs of eqn. (12) clearly vanishes since Q = C.
Model	The approximation in eqn. (5) decomposes four-index ERIs into two- and three-index-terms which is its most important feature.
Model	(la(lb + 1i|L) = ((la + 1i)lb|L) + (Ai − Bi)(lalb|L), with 1i = (δix, δiy, δiz,) for i = x,y,z.
